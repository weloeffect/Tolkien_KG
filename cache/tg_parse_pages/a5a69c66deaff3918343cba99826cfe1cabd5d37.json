of the seven [[Sons of Fëanor]]. They are most notable for being [[twins]], greatly alike in mood and face, and of being hunters. They are among the least mentioned of the princes of the Noldor, with only six mentions each in the ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', and are almost always referred to jointly.\n\nThroughout the majority of the [[legendarium]], Amrod is noted as being the elder twin and Amras the younger. Only in a very late story, while working out the etymology of the names of the Sons of Fëanor, did Tolkien invert this and also gave Amrod a different fate. That story, however, was not incorporated into the published ''[[Silmarillion]]''.\n\n==History==\n===Life in Valinor===\n<!-- Unique -->\nAmrod and Amras were twins, and the youngest of the seven sons of [[Fëanor]] and [[Nerdanel]], born in [[Valinor]] during the Time of the [[Two Trees]]. They were both red-haired and alike in mood and face,<ref name=\"S|Princes\">{{S|Princes}}</ref> though the elder's hair colour grew darker, and he was more dear to his father. After childhood they were not to be confused.<ref name=\"Feanor\">{{PM|Feanor}}</ref> Twins were very rare among the Eldar, with Amrod and Amras being the only case recorded in the ancient histories until the later children in the line of [[Dior]].<ref>{{NM|P1iv}}</ref>\n\n<!-- All Sons of Fëanor -->\nFëanor and his sons abode seldom in one place for long, but travelled far and wide upon the confines of Valinor, going even to the borders of the Dark and the cold shores of the [[Outer Sea]], seeking the unknown. Often they were guests in the halls of [[Aulë]].<ref name=\"S|Princes\"/> \n\n<!-- All Sons of Fëanor -->\nDuring the [[unrest of the Noldor]] and the strife between Fëanor and his half-brother [[Fingolfin]], Fëanor was banished from [[Tirion]] and took up residence in [[Formenos]]; he was followed by his father, King [[Finwë]], and his sons.<ref name=Unrest>{{S|Unrest}}</ref> Along with Finwë, the sons of Fëanor did not attend the [[high feast]] and were out riding when Formenos was attacked by [[Melkor]] and [[Ungoliant]] after the pair had [[darkening of Valinor|killed the Two Trees]]. They attempted to return, but as they approached they were thrown from their horses and lay upon their faces, blind and without strength. Once the cloud passed and they could move again, they entered Formenos and found Finwë dead, the house ravaged, and the Silmarils stolen. They then sped to the [[Ring of Doom]] where [[Maedhros]] informed [[Manwë]] and, unknowingly, Fëanor who kept himself hidden during the conversation. Fëanor reacted by cursing both Melkor and the summons of Manwë, and then fleeing into the night; the sons of Fëanor followed him, dismayed that he might slay himself.<ref>{{MR|P3II8}}, §§7-12</ref>\n\n<!-- All Sons of Fëanor -->\nFëanor and his sons soon returned to Tirion where during a [[Speech of Fëanor|great speech by Fëanor]], they took a [[Oath of Fëanor|terrible and blasphemous oath]] of enmity and vengeance against all or any who dares to claim any part or right in the Silmarils, and led most of the [[Exile of the Noldor|Noldor into exile]]. To obtain the ships needed to pursue Morgoth into [[Middle-earth]], Fëanor's host seized them from the [[Falmari]], [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë|killing many when they resisted]], and thus came under the [[Doom of Mandos]]. After a long march northwards, the Noldor drew close to the [[Helcaraxë]], a land bridge deemed impassable, and the narrow strait between Aman and Middle-earth they intended to sail. With too few ships remaining to ferry all the Noldor at once, and the fear of treachery between their houses, Fëanor and his sons stole away in them, abandoning the host of Fingolfin.<ref name=Flight>{{S|Flight}}</ref>\n\n=== Return to Middle-earth ===\n<!-- All Sons of Fëanor -->\nAfter landing at the [[Firth of Drengist]], and burning the ships to prevent any from sailing back, Fëanor's host traveled north and encamped on the northern shore of [[Lake Mithrim]] where they were attacked unaware by a host of Morgoth. In [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath|the battle that followed]], Fëanor's forces were swiftly victorious, and pursued the routed orcs over the [[Mountains of Shadow]] into [[Ard-galen]].<ref name=Return>{{S|Return}}</ref>\n\n<!-- All Sons of Fëanor -->\nThough Morgoth's assaulting forces were destroyed, Fëanor recklessly drew far ahead of his host in pursuit of the remnant orcs, and was ambushed and mortally wounded at the confines of [[Dor Daedeloth]]. He was rescued by his sons, and just before his death he laid it on them to uphold their oath and to avenge him. Shortly after, Maedhros was taken captive after feigning to treat with Morgoth.<ref name=Return/>\n\n<!-- All Sons of Fëanor -->\nThe host of Fëanor remained at northern shore of Lake Mithrim until the arrival of Fingolfin's host, having successfully crossed the Helcaraxë, with [[Years of the Sun|first sunrise]] in {{FA|1}}. To avoid open hostilities with Fingolfin's larger forces, the remaining sons of Fëanor relocated to the southern shore of Lake Mithrim.<ref>{{GA|59}}</ref> \n\n<!-- All Sons of Fëanor -->\nThe hatred between the houses began to be assuaged in {{FA|5}}, when Maedhros was rescued by Fingolfin's son [[Fingon]], and two years later the Noldor held a [[council in Mithrim|great common council]] where Fingolfin was chosen to be [[High King of the Noldor|overlord of the Noldor]]. Maedhros subsequently waived his claim to the title, and shortly after relocated the House of Fëanor to [[East Beleriand]]. In {{FA|20}}, Fingolfin held the great [[Mereth Aderthad|Feast of Reuniting]] where the Elven houses, both Noldor and [[Sindar]], pledged common cause against Morgoth.<ref>{{GA|61-72}}, p. 48</ref>\n\n===Deeds in Beleriand===\n<!-- Unique -->\n[[File:Lída_Holubová_-_Double.jpg|right|thumb|''Double'' by [[Lída Holubová]]]]\nThe great Elf houses soon settled around Morgoth's dwelling in [[Angband]], laying it to [[Siege of Angband|siege]]. Amrod and Amras settled the region between the rivers [[Celon]] and [[Little Gelion]] where few folk dwelt, and took it as their realm and hunting-ground.<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, §111</ref> They became renown as great hunters of the woods, though not more than [[Celegorm]],<ref>{{SM|Q3}}</ref> and seldom came northward while the Siege lasted.<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Unique -->\nIn {{FA|310}}, [[Finrod]] discovered and befriended the [[House of Bëor]], the first [[Men]] in [[Ossiriand]].<ref name=\"WJ\">{{WJ|West}}</ref>{{rp|215–8}} The presence of Men was of discomfort to the [[Green-elves]] who dwelt there though, and by Finrod's advice [[Bëor]]'s people relocated to the lands of Amrod and Amras, upon the east banks of the Celon south of [[Nan Elmoth]], near to the borders of Doriath; and the name of that land thereafter was [[Estolad]].<ref>{{S|West}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Caranthir and A&A -->\nIn {{FA|455}}, Morgoth broke the [[Siege of Angband]] with a [[Dagor Bragollach|massive assault]] against the Noldor. The defences of the Sons of Fëanor were breached and [[Caranthir]] fled and joined the remnant of his people to the scattered folk of Amrod and Amras, and they further retreated past [[Ramdal]] in the south. Upon [[Amon Ereb]] they maintained a watch and some strength of war, and they had aid of the Green-elves. The Orcs came not into Ossiriand, nor to [[Taur-im-Duinath]] and the wilds of the south.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>\n\n<!-- All Sons of Fëanor except Celegorm and Curufin -->\nIn {{FA|466}}, the mortal [[Beren]] and the Elf-maiden [[Lúthien]] succeeded in their [[Quest for the Silmaril|quest to retrieve a Silmaril]] from the [[Iron Crown]] of Morgoth.<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref> This victory caused Maedhros to believe that Morgoth was not unassailable; and understanding that Morgoth would destroy them all, one by one, if they could not again unite, formed the [[Union of Maedhros]] to oppose him in force.<ref name=Nirnaeth>{{S|Nirnaeth}}</ref>\n\n<!-- All Sons of Fëanor -->\nIn {{FA|472}}, the Union of Maedhros launched their [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad|disastrous assault on Morgoth]].  During the battle, their host was scattered and all of the sons of Fëanor were wounded, though none slain. Gathering a remnant of their forces, they managed to hew their way out, and escaped towards [[Mount Dolmed]]. In the aftermath of the battle, the sons of Fëanor were greatly diminished, and took to a woodland life, mingling with the Green-elves of Ossiriand.<ref name=Nirnaeth />\n\n<!-- All Sons of Fëanor -->\nIn {{FA|503}}, [[Dior]], son of Beren and Lúthien, became king of [[Doriath]] following [[Thingol]]'s death in a dispute with the [[Dwarves]] over the great treasure, the [[Nauglamír|Necklace of the Dwarves]] bearing a Silmaril, and Doraith's subsequent [[battle in the Thousand Caves|ransacking]] by the Dwarves. Dior wore the Silmaril openly, and used its power to restore the realm. In {{FA|505}} the sons of Fëanor learned of the Silmaril in Doriath and, initially restrained by Maedhros, sent a message to Dior demanding its return, to which Dior sent no response. In late {{FA|506}} Celegorm roused the brothers and in winter they [[Second Kinslaying|attacked Doriath]]. While the Fëanorian's ended up holding the field, it was a hollow victory: they took heavy losses, including the deaths of Celegorm (by Dior's hand), [[Curufin]], and Caranthir; and the Silmaril escaped, now borne by Dior's daughter [[Elwing]].<ref>{{WJ|Years}}, pg. 467-8</ref>\n\nIn {{FA|538}}, the remaining Sons of Fëanor, still seeking the Silmaril now borne by Elwing, [[Third Kinslaying|attacked the Havens of Sirion]] in an effort to reclaim it.<ref name=\"Years\">{{WJ|Years}}, p. 348</ref> During this battle, not only did Elwing again escape with the Silmaril, but both Amrod and Amras were slain.<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Amrod'' is directly [[Sindarized]] version of the [[Quenya]] name '''''Ambarto''''' [''amba'' (\"up\"; \"upwards\"; \"top\") + ''arata'' (\"high\"; \"noble\"; \"exalted\"; \"lofty\"; \"excellent\")].<ref name=\"Feanor\" /><ref name=\"VT41\">{{VT|41b}}, p. 10</ref><ref group=note>In [[Gnomish]], ''Amrod'' has the meaning \"wondering, living in the woods\" [''am'' (\"upwards\") + ''-ra'' (verb suffix)]</ref>\n\n''Amras'' is a directly Sindarized version of the Quenya name '''''Ambarussa''''' (\"top-russet\") [''amba'' (\"up\"; \"upwards\"; \"top\") + ''russa'' (\"red-haired\"; \"copper coloured\")].<ref name=\"Feanor\" /><ref name=\"VT41\" /><ref group=note>In later writings, ''Ambarussa'' was Sindarized as ''Amr'''o'''s'' instead of ''Amr'''a'''s''</ref>\n\n==Other names==\n'''''Pityafinwë''''' (\"Little Finwë\"),<ref group=note>Tolkien amended this to '''''Nityafinwë''''' (also meaning \"Little Finwë\")</ref> shortened as '''''Pityo''''', was the [[father-name]] of the elder-twin.<ref name=\"Feanor\" />\n\n'''''Telufinwë''''' (\"Last Finwë\"), shortened as '''''Telvo''''', was the father-name of the younger-twin.<ref name=\"Feanor\" />\n\n'''''Minyarussa''''' (\"First-russa\") and '''''Atyarussa''''' (\"Second-russa\") were the names others called them by;<ref name=\"VT41\" /> the twins themselves called each other ''Ambarussa''.<ref name=\"Feanor\" /> \n\n'''''Umbarto''''' (\"Fated\") is Quenya, the masculinzed form of ''umbar'' (\"fate\"); in Sindarin form it would have been '''''Amarthan'''''.<ref name=\"VT41\" /> The name ''Ambarto''/''Umbarto'' was used by no one.<ref name=\"Feanor\" /> Details on this name are provided below.\n\n'''''Damrod''''' was the name used for ''Amrod'' for most of the earlier Silmarillion material.

Either disturbed by such an ominous name, or because he misheard her, Fëanor changed it to ''Ambarto'' and gave it as the mother-name to Telufinwë, the younger twin. \n\nLater, after Fëanor's rebellion and as he was preparing his host for Exile and return to Middle-earth, Nerdanel approached him and begged that he should leave her youngest twin sons, or at least one of them. Fëanor rejected this, and stated that by deserting him (in not joining the Exile) she was deserting all their children as well. In anger Nerdanel retorted that he would not keep all of them, and one at least would never set foot on Middle-earth.\n\nWhen Fëanor later stole the Telerian ships, abandoning Fingolfin's host, Telufinwë was shocked by the treachery. After landing in Middle-earth, Fëanor's host disembarked and camped on land, though Telufinwë remained on-board, claiming that he would not come ashore to sleep in discomfort. It is thought that it was in his mind to sail his ship back and rejoin Nerdanel.\n\nThus, the morning after Fëanor burned the Telerian ships, only six of his seven sons were to be found when his host was mustered. At that point Pityafinwë (Ambarussa / Amras) went pale with fear and asked Fëanor if he had roused Telufinwë who had not left the ship.\n\nFëanor guessed Telufinwë's purpose for remaining on-board and, hiding his dismay, answered that he destroyed that ship first. Pityafinwë then spoke: ''\"Then rightly you gave the name to the youngest of your children, and Umbarto 'the Fated' was its true form. Fell and fey are you become.\"'' No one dared to speak again of this matter to Fëanor.<ref name=\"Feanor\" />\n\n{{references|note}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Amrod and Amras}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Noldor]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n[[Category:Sons of Fëanor]]"}}}
