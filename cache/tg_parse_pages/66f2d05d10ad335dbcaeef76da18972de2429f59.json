It includes the ''[[A Part of the Shire]]'' map.\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Concerning Hobbits===\nA brief history of [[Hobbits]] from their origins in the [[Vales of Anduin|Vales]] of [[Anduin]], to their movement into [[Eriador]], their trusteeship of [[The Shire]], and the events leading up to the [[War of the Ring]]. ''Concerning Hobbits'' also provides a broad description of the physical characteristics of Hobbits, as well as their manners, customs and important families.\n\n===Concerning Pipe-weed===\nExplanation of the [[Hobbits]]' fascination with [[pipe-weed]], its history (as laid out in [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]]'s ''[[Herblore of the Shire]]'') and the notable varieties of [[Old Toby]], [[Longbottom Leaf]] and [[Southern Star]]. \n\n===Of the Ordering of the Shire===\nDescribes the division of [[The Shire]] ([[Northfarthing|North]], [[Southfarthing|South]], [[Eastfarthing|East]] and [[Westfarthing]]s; with [[Buckland]] and [[Westmarch]]), as well as the governing of The Shire (the [[Thain]], the [[Mayor of Michel Delving]] and the [[Shirriffs]]).\n\n===Of the Finding of the Ring===\nCovers the chapters in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' which deal with [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]'s finding of the [[One Ring]].\n\n===Note on the Shire Records===\nDetails the documentation in [[The Shire]] on the history of the [[War of the Ring]].\n\nThis entire section entered the Prologue only with the second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 40</ref>\n\n==History of composition==\n[[Christopher Tolkien]] published a detailed description of how his father composed this text in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', in the first chapter \"[[The Prologue]]\".\n\n\"Concerning Hobbits\" derives from a text providing background information on the Hobbits, written in the latter half of [[1938]], while rewriting ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. xxi</ref> It was further worked with more background material, during Tolkien's final proofreading in [[1949]].<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. xxviii</ref>\n\nThe basis of \"Concerning Pipe-weed\" was a lengthy speech of Merry about pipe-weed in a draft of the chapter ''[[The Road to Isengard]]'', eventually removed and reworked.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. xxiv</ref>\n\nThe \"Prologue\" would include a description of hobbit gift-giving customs and the ''[[ribadyan]]'' (birthday celebrant) but it was dropped, being too lengthy.<ref>{{L|214}}</ref>\n\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''[[2001]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':\n:In the first scene, titled \"[[Prologue: One Ring to Rule Them All...]]\", there is a brief description of how [[Bilbo Baggins]] found the One Ring, clearly related to \"Of the Finding of the Ring\".\n\n:\"Concerning Hobbits\" is the name of the [[Concerning Hobbits (scene)|second scene]] of the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (extended edition)|Extended Edition]] wherein \"Concerning Hobbits\" is the first chapter of Bilbo's [[Red Book of Westmarch|book]], in which he describes the nature of Hobbits. The audience hears Bilbo reading this aloud as a voiceover on top of scenes of life in [[The Shire]]. The [[Concerning Hobbits (soundtrack)|scene's soundtrack]] composed by [[Howard Shore]] is also called \"Concerning Hobbits\" and is used as a primary theme of the Shire.\n\n{{references}}{{lotr}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:''The Lord of the Rings'' Prologue}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings chapters]]"}}}
