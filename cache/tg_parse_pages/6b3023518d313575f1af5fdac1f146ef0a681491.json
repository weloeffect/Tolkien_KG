When he awakes, Elanor struggles to communicate with him. Unsettled, he suddenly causes great winds with his voice, and utters strange words Elanor cannot interpret. Back at home, [[Largo Brandyfoot|Largo]] injures his ankle putting up a canopy.\n\nLater in the episode, at evening, Poppy and Elanor meet with the Stranger again. They offer their help, unsure if he understands them. With telekinetic powers, he breaks open Poppy's firefly-lantern, and as the fireflies disperse, he speaks to them, entranced as the fly around. Then he arranges them into a certain constellation against the night sky, which Elanor believes to be a clue to find The Stranger's home. The fireflies drop dead afterwards.\n\n===The Southlands===\nIn the fresh ruins of Hordern, where no survivors are present, [[Arondir]] and [[Bronwyn]] find and enter the burnt house of her friends [[Ciaran]] and [[Hana]]. Arondir goes alone into a tunnel below ground, leading from the house. By an underground pool, within the hour, he is suddenly seized into the dark by an unknown foe.\n\nBack at Waldreg's tavern in [[Tirharad]], Bronwyn tries to convince the folk to spread the news of Hordern, but with no luck. At Bronwyn's house, Theo discovers beneath their floor-boards a long-hidden [[Orcs|Digger Orc]] (whose noise Theo had believed was caused by mice) just as Bronwyn returns home. As the Digger Orc emerges, they hide from him, and then desperately try to kill him. She manages to behead the Digger Orc. With his head, Bronwyn goes and convinces the town-folk to seek safety and relocate to the [[Watchtower of Ostirith]], the local outpost.\n\nTheo privately inspects the strange weapon he had found with Rowan in the prior episode, and then embarks with his mother, as all citizens of Tirharad exit the town with their belongings toward Ostirith.\n\n===Eregion and Khazad-dûm===\n[[Elrond]] goes and meets [[Celebrimbor]] at [[Ost-in-Edhil]], capital of [[Eregion]], and marvels at [[Fëanor|Fëanor's hammer]], which was used to craft the [[Silmarils]]. Celebrimbor tells of his own new ambitions, requesting that Elrond assist him in attaining the means to build a specialized forge-tower, necessary for crafting things of real power. For this they go to [[Khazad-dûm]] to enlist the aid of the [[Dwarves]]. In Khazad-dûm, Elrond invokes the [[Rite of Sigin-tarâg]] to earn [[Durin IV|Prince Durin]]'s favor in the Dwarven test of endurance. He looses the test, but convinces him to hear his proposal. He joins Durin and his wife, [[Disa]], for dinner, and tells his proposal off-screen.\n\nDurin later relays the proposal to King [[Durin III]], his father, who is untrusting, and cautious against the notion of cooperation between Dwarves and Elves. In the same room, Durin III opens a chest, and the two observe a precious shiny object within, blocked from view.\n\n===The Sea===\nSwimming back to [[Middle-earth]], Galadriel encounters a raft of stranded human mariners frightened of a nearby nameless thing known as the worm that had wrecked their ship. Among them are [[Halbrand]], Eamon, and Abigail. The worm soon finds them and destroys the raft, and Galadriel escapes with Halbrand only. Heading east, Halbrand questions Galadriel's business at sea, and after an argument, she is gratified to learn from him that Orcs are indeed still active on Middle-earth, as they had driven Halbrand from his home in the [[Mordor|Southlands]]. At dusk, the waters turn stormy, and Galadriel nearly drowns before Halbrand rescues her.\n\nIn the last moment of the episode, an unknown ship the next morning finds Galadriel and Halbrand wearily sleeping on their raft.\n\n==Cast==\n:''In order of appearance'' (in episode credits)\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!

(Concerning Hobbits)\"\n* '''Scene 12''' - \"[[Eregion]] is the newest elven realm in Middle-earth, to the west of the [[Misty Mountains]]. It was founded in the early [[Second Age]] by the [[Noldor]], [[High Elves]] especially known for their craftsmanship. ([[Appendix B]]).\"\n* '''Scene 13''' - \"This door is the original [[West-gate]] of [[Khazad-dum]]. On it are carved inscriptions in [[Cirth]], a runic alphabet originally derived by the elves, but adapted for dwarven purposes to carve their language into stone. ([[Appendix E]])\"\n* '''Scene 15''' - \"Dwarves are shorter than elves and men, but they are tough, thrawn, laborious, and famously lovers of stone, gems, and all things created by craft. (Appendix F)\"\n* '''Scene 17''' - \"Despite (or perhaps because of) the difficulties of an itinerant life and challenges of finding their next meal, halflings have a deep love of food and an undoubtedly adventurous appetite. They'd eat six meals a day if they could. (Concerning Hobbits)\"\n* '''Scene 22''' - \"The [[Great Sea]], or The [[Sundering Seas]], divides the [[Undying Lands]] from Middle-earth - where there are still [[nameless things]] in the deepest places of the world. (Book III, Chapter 5)\"\n* '''Scene 25''' - \"Elves and Dwarves have traditionally held many grievances against one another; embers of the dwarves' grudge against the elves lingers even from the [[Elder Days]]. (Appendix F)\"\n* '''Scene 28''' - \"Like all of [[Khazad-dum]], [[Durin]]'s home is carved straight out of the mountain rock it's buried deep within, upheld by stone pillars. Gold and jewels are used generously, as there is no lack of such riches here, and magnificent lanterns keep the dark at bay. (Book II, Chapter 4)\"\n* '''Scene 29''' - \"The Men of Middle-earth can be known to fear and misdoubt elves, yet they often know little of them. (Book IV, Chapter 5)\"\n* '''Scene 32''' - \"[[Arondir]]'s armor is typical of his garrison of [[Silvan elves]], filled with natural influences of their many loves. The ring on his thumb bears the inscription: \"May Your Arrows Sing\" in [[Sindarin]].\"\n* '''Scene 34''' - \"There are many kinds of orcs of differing sizes, best suited for specific purposes. They were first bred by the [[Dark Power of the North]] in the [[Elder Days]]. (Appendix F)\"\n* '''Scene 36''' - \"Though immortal and hardy of body, elves may still die by injury and unnatural causes - including drowning.\"\n* '''Scene 38''' - \"The stars are especially beloved by the elves, who revere the [[Vala]] [[Elbereth]] (also called [[Varda]]), but all the cultures of Middle-earth have attributed constellations to the heavens above. (Book II, Chapter 8)\"\n\n==Production==\n\n==Deviations from the Source Material ==\nGaladriel encounters a raft with humans on board close to the area where she jumped from her ship. They say they are survivors of a shipwreck, and were presumably attempting to sail to Valinor. Humans were forbidden from trying to sail to Valinor by the Valar themselves, and often disappeared or were put under penalty of death if they tried to go there. Galadriel does not seem to know about this, however and just thinks it is normal to encounter humans in the Sundering Seas. \n\nShe meets a stranger by the name of Halbrand who says he was the ruler of an area known as \"The Southlands\". This region in the series is in the same area as what will become known as [[Mordor]]. However, in the source material it is stated in Tolkien's late writings that Mordor was already a desolate wasteland noted for volcanic activity before the Second Age, and may already have been called Mordor which means \"black land\" because of that.<ref>J.R.R Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien ed. The History of Middle Earth Volume 12, ''The Peoples of Middle Earth. \"''Part XIII: Late Writings\"</ref> \n\nThe Southlands are never mentioned in the source material, and were apparently invented for the series as were all the characters who live there. It would have made no sense for Sauron, who was hiding for most of the Second Age, to pick a densely populated region with like the Southlands as his base: especially since Elves already patrolled the region. He picked Mordor because it was already a desolate, volcanic wasteland.  \n\nHarfoots are said to be \"proto-Hobbits\" or an ancestor of Hobbits, but The Fellowship of the Ring novel lists them as a one of three breeds of Hobbits, without any indication that they arose before the other two breeds.<ref name=\":0\">J.R.R Tolkien, ''The Fellowship of the Ring'', Prologue: Part 1 \"Concerning Hobbits\"</ref> There is also no clear indication of the presence of Hobbits in Middle Earth before the Second Age.  \n\nThe protaganist's name. \"Nori\" is a shortened form of \"Elinor\". Elinor was the name of Samwise Gamgee's daughter as noted in ''The Lord of the Rings'' and some of Tolkien's later writings. It is of Sindarin derivation. It is unclear how and why one of the Harfoots, who are noted to be a reclusive species who fear strangers would have encountered Elves or become familiar enough with Sindarin to give their child a name in that language. In fact, the Prologue to the ''Fellowship of the Ring'' notes that the Harfoots \"had much to do with Dwarves in ancient times\" but does not mention any association with Elves or other Sindarin speakers.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n==Reception==\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://rop.digitaltolkien.com/S1E2/ Adrift] at ROP Data\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEuYPD_VttE&t=122s&ab_channel=RingsandRealms Analysis of the first two episodes on Rings & Realms] (with [[Corey Olsen]])\n* [https://bearmccreary.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-episode-102/ Scoring ''Adrift''] by [[Bear McCreary]]\n\n{{references}}\n{{rop-episodes}}\n\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) episodes|02]]\n[[fi:Tuuliajolla (jakso)]]"}}}
