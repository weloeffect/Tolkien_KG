They were faithful allies to [[Gondor]], and eventually were the ancestors of the [[Rohirrim]].\n\n==History==\nAfter the [[Battle of the Plains]] ({{TA|1856}}), the lands of the Northmen of [[Rhovanion]] between Mirkwood and the [[River Running]] were occupied by the [[Wainriders]] and its people were enslaved. To escape this fate, many of the Northmen fled Rhovanion; some north to Dale, others south to Gondor. [[Marhwini]], son of [[Marhari]], led one such band of refugees north between the eastern bank of the [[Anduin]] and the western eaves of Mirkwood. Along the way they were joined by additional fugitives who had fled through the forest. They ended their journey in the Vales of Anduin between the [[Carrock]] and the [[Gladden Fields]], where they settled for the most part on the west side of the river. There they became known as the Éothéod.<ref name=\"Northmen\">{{UT|Northmen}}</ref>\n\nThese migrations happened outside the knowledge of [[Gondor]], who learned about their existence many years later. That was until around {{TA|1899|n}}, when Marhwini warned [[Calimehtar (King of Gondor)|Calimehtar]] that the Wainriders were plotting to raid [[Calenardhon]] over the [[Undeeps]]. But the enslaved Northmen also prepared a revolt against the Wainriders. Calimehtar therefore provoked the Wainriders out of [[Ithilien]], and his horsemen, joined by a large [[Éored]] led by Marhwini, drove the Wainriders back. Meanwhile outlaws and roused slaves from Mirkwood burned many Wainriders settlements. Marhwini retired to his land beside the Anduin, and the Northmen of his race never again returned to their former homes.<ref name=\"Northmen\" />\n\nIn the time of [[Forthwini]], the Éothéod were troubled again by raids into the south of their land, both up the river and through the [[Narrows]] of Mirkwood. The [[Lord of the Éothéod]] then warned King [[Ondoher]] that the Wainriders were recovering. The attack finally came around {{TA|1944|n}}, and men of the Éothéod fought with Ondoher. [[Faramir son of Ondoher]] refused to remain in [[Minas Tirith]] and joined a battalion of Éothéod, but was caught with a party of them as they retreated towards the [[Dead Marshes]]. The [[leader of the Éothéod]] did not manage to save him, and Faramir died in his arms before he found out that he was the Prince. He then went to join [[Minohtar]] at the head of the [[Southward Road|North Road]] in Ithilien. Eventually, the Wainriders were defeated by [[Earnil II]] at the [[Battle of the Camp]].<ref name=\"Northmen\" />\n\nIn {{TA|1975}}<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1975, p. 1086</ref>, proud \"princes of the Rhovanion\" and tall and fair riders with [[horses]] from the [[Vales of Anduin]] joined the Gondorian forces of King [[Eärnil II]], which were led by his son prince [[Eärnur]] as a part of the [[Host of the West (Arnor)|Host of the West]], and fought against the forces of the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]] in the former lands of [[Arnor]] in the [[Battle of Fornost]].<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Eärnil II, p. 1050</ref><ref group=\"note\">The riders aren't specifically stated to be Éothéod in the text, but they may have been the reason why the Éothéod heard of the defeat of the Witch-king.</ref>\n\nAt that time, the Éothéod were well-known to Gondor as a people of good trust that provided Gondor with news about what happened in the region in which they lived.<ref name=\"Ride\">{{UT|Ride}}</ref>\n\n===Migration===\n[[File:Douglas Chaffee - Framsburg.jpg|thumb|right|Douglas Chaffee - ''[[Framsburg]]''.]]\nThe Éothéod heard of the defeat of the Witch-king of Angmar and, led by their chieftain [[Frumgar]], moved from the middle vales of Anduin between the Carrock and the Gladden further north to settle near the sources of the Anduin and drove away the remnants of the people of Angmar on the east side of the Misty Mountains<ref name=\"firstparagraph\" /> in {{TA|1977}}<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1977, p. 1086</ref>.

It was not until the winter of {{TA|2509}} was past that he became aware that a great movement against Gondor was being prepared. Gondor faced an attack by the evil ''[[Balchoth]]'', and Cirion sent messengers to the capital of Éothéod. King Eorl answered the call for help, and rode out with most of the Éothéod to help their allies of old, leaving only a few hundred warriors behind to protect his people. The Riders arrived just in time to help the army of Gondor to defeat the enemy in a [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant|battle]] at the [[Field of Celebrant]].<ref name=\"Ride\" />\n\n===The Rohirrim===\nThree months later, Cirion gave the largely depopulated province of [[Calenardhon]] as a gift to Eorl and his people, and Eorl swore his [[Oath of Eorl|Oath]] of eternal friendship.
