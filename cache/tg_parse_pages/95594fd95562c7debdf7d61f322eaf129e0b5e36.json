[[Halmir]], son of [[Haldan]], called on the aid of King [[Thingol]], who sent many stout [[Sindar]]in warriors under the command of [[Beleg]] to his aid. Together, Halmir and Beleg destroyed a legion of invading Orcs, and gave the southern lands a respite from the defeats in the north.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> \n\nHaldir joined the [[Union of Maedhros]] and led a force of the [[Haladin]] in the disastrous [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]].

[[Handir]] set out to defeat them, but his men were defeated and he himself was slain.<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref> \n\nSoon after [[Brandir]]'s succession, [[Túrin]] came to [[Brethil]], and began before long to take control of the [[Haladin]] himself.

This was a late-written story that [[Christopher Tolkien]] regretfully chose not to use in ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.\n\nIn a section not included in the story it was stated that [[Avranc]], not of the House of Haleth, was chosen for the next Halad but that the authority and reverence of the office was gone.<ref name=Wanderings/>{{rp|308}}\n\nIn an isolated note [[J.R.R.
