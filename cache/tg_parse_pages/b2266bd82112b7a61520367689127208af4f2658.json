He was the youngest of the four children of [[Milo Burrows]] and [[Peony Baggins]], and when he was five years old he attended Bilbo's famous [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|Birthday Party]] along with the rest of his family.<ref>{{App|Baggins}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn earlier editions of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Appendix C]] has Minto alone of his family ''not'' marked as having attented Bilbo's party, perhaps because of his young age. In any case, later editions (cf. [[The Lord of the Rings (50th Anniversary Edition)|50th Anniversary Edition]]) mark him as an antendee.\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''\n:Minto appears in [[Hobbiton]], voiced by an uncredited [[James Arnold Taylor]]. If a conversation is started with him, he related how [[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins]] had tried to chase him and [[Sancho Proudfoot]] off with her umbrella, and Minto had thrown an apple at her (but missed) in retaliation.\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Hobbits]]\n[[Category:Burrows]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]"}}}
