He is described as a \"warrior Vala\", along with his sister [[Meássë]].\n\n== History ==\nBefore Makar came into [[Arda|the world]], he, along with his sister Meássë, was already a quarrelsome spirit, even going so far as to join [[Melko]] in his discord during the [[Music of the Ainur]].<ref>{{LT1|III}}, p. 67</ref>\n\nAfter arriving in [[Valinor]], Makar and Meássë built their dwellings, made of iron, in the north, close to those of [[Mandos]] and [[Fui]]. The only Vala who visited his dwelling was [[Tulkas]], who went there to wrestle and fight with Makar, although he did this only to keep his strength intact, for there was no friendship between the two.<ref name=Valar>{{LT1|III}}, pp. 77-8</ref>\n\nMakar, along with his sister, rode often to the [[Middle-earth|Great Lands]], where they hunted wolves and bears in the black mountains.<ref name=Valar/>\n\nWhen the Valar decided to seek out Melko and oust him from his dwelling at [[Utumna]], Makar adorned them with armour.<ref>{{LT1|IV}}, p. 101</ref> After they brought Melko to Valinor for judgement, he was the only one to speak for him, being displeased with the prospect of peace.<ref>{{LT1|IV}}, p. 105</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Elves]] awoke, and the Valar invited them to live among the Gods, he spoke against the others and was backed by Meássë, saying that Valinor was built for the Valar, and the Valar only.<ref>{{LT1|V}}, p. 117</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Darkening of Valinor]], he joined the other Valar in pursuit of Melko, who was fleeing north towards his old stronghold. Despite the chase, Melko escaped.<ref>{{LT1|VI}}, pp. 154-5</ref> However, Makar managed to capture and slay two of Melko's servants, returning with a red hand, smeared with blood. He was the only one who had any pleasure at the time, the [[Two Trees]] having been destroyed.<ref>{{LT1|VIII}}, p. 177</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n'''''Makar''''' is a [[Qenya]] name, meaning \"God of battle\". Its [[Gnomish]] equivalent is '''''Magorn''''' or '''''Magron'''''.<ref name=App>{{LT1|Appendix}}, p. 259</ref> He was also called '''''Ramandor''''' (meaning \"the Shouter\" in Qenya),<ref name=App/> as well as '''''Kostorin''''' (or '''''Gothonwi''''' in Gnomish).<ref>{{PE|14}}, p. 13</ref>\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | |,|-|-|-|.| | |}}\n{{familytree | MAK | | MEA | |MAK='''MAKAR'''|MEA=[[Meássë]]}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Qenya names]]\n[[Category:Valar]]\n[[de:Makar]]\n[[fi:Makar]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/ainur/valar/makar]]"}}}
