(also: ''fainits!; fain I!; fains!; fain it!; fainites!''): A shout (often accompanied by crossed fingers) used by UK schoolchildren to call a playground truce.

Tolkien read their letter, and wrote a long letter in reply, discussing the etymology of 'faynights'. He wrote that he read their letter \"''today, just as I had been puzzling over a curious [[Wikipedia:Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] usage''\" apparently connected with the issue.<ref>{{CG|RG}}, p. 379</ref> In their work ''[[The Lore and Language of Schoolchildren]]'', Iona and Peter Opie quoted from Tolkien's letter, that states, amongst other things, that the terms 'fains I', 'fains' and 'fainites' are survivals of [[Middle English|medieval English]] from the 14th Century.<ref>[http://www.tolkienbooks.net/php/details.php?reference=51415 Lore and Language of Schoolchildren. 1973] at [http://www.tolkienbooks.net/ Tolkienbooks.net] (accessed 26 November 2011)</ref>\n*'''Archive''': Held at the archive of Tolkien Papers, [[Bodleian Library]].\n{{references|note}}\n[[Category:Letters|Opie, Iona and Peter]]"}}}
