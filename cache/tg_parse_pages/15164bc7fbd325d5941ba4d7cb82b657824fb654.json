Thus, all the houses prepared to battle.<ref name=Fall />{{rp|175–6}}\n[[File:Mysilvergreen - The Fall of Gondolin.jpg|200px|thumb|right|''The Fall of Gondolin'' by [[:Category:Images by Mysilvergreen|Mysilvergreen]]]]\nWhen the [[Fall of Gondolin]] began, all of them suffered great losses or were completely destroyed, except the House of the King, who remained in the palace to protect the King.<ref name=Fall />{{rp|183}} First, the folk of the Mole were scattered after they attacked the folk of the Wing and Meglin was killed by Tuor. Later, after the northern gate was lost, Duilin was killed, but the house of the Swallow kept fighting without their lord. Soon the folk of the Hammer and their lord Rog were butchered outside the walls; Penlod suffered the next attack, so he was killed and both of his houses lost many men.<ref name=Fall />{{rp|178–9}} Meanwhile, the host of the Harp abandoned their treacherous lord Salgant and went to save the folk of the Golden Flower, being mostly destroyed in the [[Great Market]].<ref name=Fall />{{rp|182–3}} \n\nThereafter the survivors of all kindreds were reunited in the [[Square of the Palace]], save those of the Hammer of Wrath alone. In that square, Ecthelion and [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]] slew each other. There also King Turgon proclaimed the fall of Gondolin and ordered the survivors to follow Tuor, but his royal folk stayed with him.<ref name=Fall />{{rp|183–4}} Later he and his house were killed when the [[Tower of the King]] fell.<ref name=Fall />{{rp|187}} After the [[exiles of Gondolin]] escaped, Glorfindel died saving them from a [[Balrog]].<ref name=Fall />{{rp|194}}\n\nThus, apart from Tuor, the only lords who survived the Fall of Gondolin were Egalmoth and Galdor. Egalmoth was later killed in a battle at the [[Mouths of Sirion]], but Galdor would reach [[Tol Eressëa]] and even keep some followers.<ref>{{LT2|IIIn}}, ''Entries in the Name-list to The Fall of Gondolin'', p. 215</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nTolkien never wrote again about the houses of Gondolin in later texts, because his writings never include details about the city.
