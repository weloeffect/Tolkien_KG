''Thengel'', p. 1069</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAlthough Morwen dwelt in [[Lossarnach]], she did not belong to the people of that land. Her father was originally from [[Belfalas]], having relocated to Lossarnach for its flowering vales. He was a descendant of a former [[Prince of Dol Amroth]], making him and Morwen kinsfolk of [[Imrahil|Prince Imrahil]].<ref name=linear/> \n\nIn {{TA|2943}}, Morwen married [[Thengel]] of [[Rohan]] in [[Gondor]], though she was seventeen years the younger. While living in [[Gondor]] she bore three children, of whom [[Théoden]], the second, was her only son. Following the death of his father, [[Fengel]], Thengel inherited the [[King of Rohan|Kingship of Rohan]] and returned to Rohan with Morwen. There, she bore him two more daughters.<ref name=\"Eorl\"/> The youngest, [[Théodwyn]], was the fairest<ref name=\"Eorl\"/> and would become the mother of [[Éomer]] and [[Éowyn]]<ref name=\"Third Line\">{{App|Mark}}, ''Third Line'', p. 1070</ref>.\n\n== Description ==\nThe [[Rohirrim]] bestowed upon Morwen the epithet ''Steelsheen''.<ref name=\"Third Line\"/>\n\nAs one of the [[Dúnedain of the South]] with high [[Númenórean]] lineage, Morwen passed on traits of stature<ref name=linear/> and bearing<ref name=\"Third Line\"/>. Her descendants - particularly Éomer - were said to be considerably taller than most of the [[Rohirrim]], and some inherited her dark hair.<ref name=linear/> Her granddaughter [[Éowyn]], was also slender and tall, and bore the same graceful and proud-bearing manner of [[Gondor]].<ref name=\"Third Line\"/>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''Morwen'' has earlier origins in [[J.R.R._Tolkien|Tolkien's]] [[Legendarium]], notably belonging to a prominent member of the [[House of Bëor]] in the [[First Age]]. In [[Sindarin]] it means \"Dark Maiden\", from the root [[MOR]]- (\"black, dark, darkness\") + the female suffix ''[[-wen]]'' (\"maiden\").<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1632718649.html|articlename=S.
