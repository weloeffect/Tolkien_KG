He was considered to be the prince of the cat-servants of Melko and dwelled in a castle on a cliff not greatly distant from [[Angband|Angamandi]]. He was also said to harbour a few mice, fierce and large as rats, that he allowed to dwell in dark holes for his own amusement.<ref name=LT2I/>{{rp|16}} While his subjects feared the dogs that dwelled in the woods nearby, he had a particular scorn for [[Huan]], the Captain of Dogs, for Huan had once nearly caught him, although Tevildo had paid him for it with a gash from his great claws. Tevildo remained prideful and wished to do harm to Huan.<ref name=LT2I/>{{rp|21}}\n\nDuring his [[quest for the Silmaril]], [[Beren]] was captured by Melko and was sent to work as a thrall in Tevildo's kitchens. Upon meeting Beren for the first time, Tevildo took an instant disliking of him due to smelling that he preferred dogs over cats. He initially assumed that Melko sent Beren for the cats \"''to make meat of him''.\" When Melko's intent was made clear, Tevildo boasted that no race is better at catching birds and beasts than his subjects, but he gave Beren a difficult test to prove his skill as a thrall, tasking him to catch three fierce mice in three days. Beren failed, and Tevildo had him punished and made a scullion. So miserable did Tevildo make Beren that he wished he never saw Tinúviel.<ref name=LT2I/>{{rp|16–17}}\n\nLater on, Tevildo was roused from his sleep when Tinúviel was brought before him by [[Umuiyan]] the Doorcat. Angry at being disturbed, Tevildo accused Tinúviel of having dealings with dogs. Tinúviel claimed that she had recently escaped from a mighty dog he knew well. Intrigued, Tevildo ordered Umuiyan to bring her to the kitchens. When Umuiyan instead fell asleep under the spell of Tinúviel's cloak, Tevildo ordered for him to be thrown from a cliff.<ref name=LT2I/>{{rp|23–24}} After that, Tevildo brought Tinúviel to the kitchens himself, unintentionally allowing her to make her presence known to Beren. Tevildo considered bringing her to Melko, but chose to first listen to her story. Tinúviel told Tevildo of Huan laying injured in the woods nearby. Tevildo's wish to believe this was true led him to fall for Tinúviel's ruse and he followed her with two of his thanes, one of which was [[Oikeroi]].<ref name=LT2I/>{{rp|41–45}}\n\nWhen they come upon the seemingly wounded Huan in the [[Withered Dale]], Tevildo planned to come on him from all sides, but Huan attacked as the cats approached. Huan managed to kill Oikeroi and chase the other thane away, leaving Tevildo to fiercely fight Huan on his own. Huan came close to killing Tevildo, but was struck in the eye, giving Tevildo the opportunity to escape up a tree.<ref name=LT2I/>{{rp|46–47}} Huan refused to let him down until Tevildo revealed the whereabouts of Tinúviel and Beren, and then forced him to toss down his golden collar (a dishonour in it of itself) and to reveal the spell which held the stones of his castle together and filled his subjects with evil power beyond their nature. Returning to the castle, Tinúviel spoke the words of the spell and commanded the now shrunken cats to release every prisoner and thrall they had ever taken. However, Tevildo’s only prisoners were Beren and an aged [[Gnome]] named [[Gimli (elf)|Gimli]]. Tinúviel lead Beren and Huan away. Eventually, Melko learned that Tevildo had lost his power over the cats and he cursed and banished him. Tevildo remained wrathful long after, desiring to recapture Beren and Tinúviel, slay Huan, and regain Melko's favor, yet was never able to for his own fear of Melko was so great that all he could do was sit in his hall wondering what to do. The race of cats ever after lived bitter lives.<ref name=LT2I/>{{rp|54–57}}\n\n== Characteristics ==\n{{Blockquote|…he was a mighty cat and coal-black and evil to look upon. His eyes were long and very narrow and slanted, and gleamed both red and green, but his great grey whiskers were as stout and as sharp as needles. His purr was like the roll of drums and his growl like thunder, but when he yelled in wrath it turned the blood cold, and indeed small beasts and birds were frozen as to stone, or dropped lifeless often at the very sound.|[[Vëannë]] to [[Eriol]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]'', \"[[The Tale of Tinúviel]]\"<ref name=LT2I/>{{rp|15–16}}}}\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Tevildo'' is [[Qenya]]. Although it is not given a literal translation, it is said to derive from the root TEFE related to \"hate\" or \"hatred\".<ref name=Names>{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry \"Tevildo\"</ref>\n\n==Other names==\nHis [[Gnomish]] name was '''''Tifil'''''.<ref name=Names/> This Gnomish name was later changed to '''''Tiberth'''''; and he was given the titles ''Vardo Meoita'' in Qenya and ''Bridhon Miaugion'' in Gnomish, both meaning \"Prince of Cats\".<ref>{{LT2|Appendix}}, entry \"Tevildo\"</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nAs Tolkien developed his mythology, Tevildo's place in the narrative was replaced by that of the Necromancer, [[Thû]], who in turn became [[Sauron]] in the later [[legendarium]]. Thû was the \"Lord of Werewolves\", in contrast to Tevildo's position as \"Prince of Cats\"; the cat-versus-dog theme prominent in the \"[[Tale of Tinúviel]]\" was thus eliminated in later writings.<ref>{{LT2|In}}: \"''‘explanatory’ beast-fable (concerning cats and dogs) was to be entirely eliminated...''\"</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\n''Tevildo'' resembles in form the name ''[[:Wikipedia:Tybalt|Tybalt]]'' from William Shakespeare's ''Romeo and Juliet'', who also has the title of \"Prince of Cats\".\n\nAlso noteworthy is ''[[:Wikipedia:Cath Palug|Cath Palug]]'', a monstrous cat in Welsh legend. In some Arthurian stories there are also mentions of a fight between King Arthur himself and a evil cat (sometimes named Cath Palug). In some stories Arthur is victorious, but in others the king is killed by the cat.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Miaulë]]\n* [[Oikeroi]]\n* [[Umuiyan]]\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Fays]]\n[[Category:Qenya names]]\n[[Category:Rulers in the Great Lands]]\n[[Category:Servants of Melkor]]"}}}
