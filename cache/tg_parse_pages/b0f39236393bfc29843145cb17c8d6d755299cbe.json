On 29 August 2019 it was released on Steam for Windows and Mac, and later in the year was released on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/Series S.\n\nIt is a digital adaptation of [[The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game]], a physical \"living card game\", published by Fantasy Flight Games starting in 2011. The digital version features many art assets from the LCG being re-purposed as well as implementing many of the original game's concepts (the spheres of influence, enemy threat, and some scenarios).\n\n \nIn Summer 2020, the stewardship of the game was assumed by \t[https://www.antiherostudios.com/home/ Antihero Studios] who would provide a new UI (more mobile-friendly), a new ''Rohan''-inspired scenario (Adventure Pack, \"The Fords of Isen\"), and the much-requested feature of an Offline play mode.\nAt some point in 2021, active development by Antihero Studios ceased, and there has been no communication regarding the game's future status, although it is still available for purchase on Steam and other sites (e.g. Fanatical).\n \n==Gameplay==\nIt is a single-player or co-operative turn-based game in which players attempt to complete objective(s) before the Threat Level (''Sauron's'' ever-increasing awareness) reaches its maximum amount, which will end the game.\n\nA single player working alone or two players working together play an adventure scenario to accomplish an objective.  The players alternate turns, also alternating with ''Sauron's'' turn (played by the computer), in which events, creatures, or other cards are played to hinder the players' progress.  Players may construct decks utilizing single-themed or multiple colors as they choose.  The deck size is limited to thirty (30) cards.  \n \nEach character in the game is associated to one of four spheres of influence: Lore (lt. purple ['ᚠ']), Lore (green [book]) Spirit (blue [star]), Tactics (red [sword]).  The game begins with three main characters together in play, with additional characters appearing as they are played from the player's hand.\n \nVarious action and item cards also have one of the above four matching colors to indicate which characters may use them. \n \nDuring gameplay, usually only one action (such as a character attacking an enemy) or a single card being played (giving a character an item) is permitted per turn before play passes to ''Sauron''.  If the character has sufficient Fate points, they may include selecting an action from the Fate meter (the benefits change from game-to-game based on the scenario and the location within the scenario).\n[[IMAGE:MithrandirsAdvice.png|thumb|''Example of Lore (green) card allowing the player to draw two cards.'']]\n==External links==\n*'''[https://https://store.steampowered.com/app/509580/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_Adventure_Card_Game__Definitive_Edition/ Steam Product Page]'''\n{{Navbox_cards}}\n{{Videogames}}\n[[Category:Card-based video games]]"}}}
