The song name is taken from [[Kôr]], a rejected name for [[Túna]]. The Lyrics are a converted form of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s poem, [[The Trees of Kortirion|Kortirion among the Trees]].\n\n== Lyrics ==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nO fading town upon an island hill, \nOld shadows linger in thine ancient gate, \nThy robe is grey, thine old heart now is still; \nThy towers silent in the mist await their crumbling end \nWhile through the storeyed elms \nThe gliding black water leaves these inland realms, \nAnd slips between long meadows to the Sea, \nStill bearing downward over murmurous falls \nOne day and then another to the Sea \nAnd slowly thither many years have gone \n\nAll thy trees, Kortirion, were bent, \nAnd shook with sudden whispering lament: \nFor passing were the days, and doomed the nights \nWhen flittering ghost-moths danced round \ntapers in the moveless air nighttime \n\nAnd doomed already were the radiant dawns, \nThe odour and the noise of meads, \nwhen all thy trees were bent, \nand shook with sudden whispering lament \n\nAnd slowly thither many years have gone \nsince first the elves here built ancient, renowned Kortirion\n</poem>\n{{title}}\n[[Category:Songs by Summoning]]"}}}
