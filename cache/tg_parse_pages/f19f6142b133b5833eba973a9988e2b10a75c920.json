She has a vision of a child clothed in white running across her path. She watches as the boy runs with his arms outstretched to his father, an aged [[Aragorn]], who picks him up with joy and kisses him. As the boy looks at her and she sees he is wearing the [[Elfstone|Evenstar]], she knows the boy to be [[Eldarion|her child]]. Tears fill her eyes as she remembers the words of [[Elrond|her father]]: ''\"There is nothing for you here, only death\"''. \n\nShe opens her eyes and finds the vision has disappeared. [[Figwit|An elf]] tells her they must not delay, however she makes the decision to return to [[Rivendell]]. Arwen asks Elrond what his gift of foresight showed him regarding her future. He tells her he saw death, but Arwen tells him that he saw her son. ''\"That future is almost gone. Nothing is certain,\"'' Elrond says, looking careworn. Arwen says to him ''\"Some things are certain. If I leave [[Aragorn|him]] now, I will regret it forever.\"''\n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King scenes|09]]"}}}
