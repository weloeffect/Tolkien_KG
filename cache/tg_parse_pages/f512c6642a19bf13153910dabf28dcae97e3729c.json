Tolkien acknowledges Ransome's suggestion about changing some words in ''[[The Hobbit]]''. Ransome had suggested that it might be inappropriate to use the word ''men'' when referring to [[Hobbits]] and [[Dwarves]]: Tolkien justifies the character [[Thorin]]'s use of ''man'' by claiming it was \"''the language in those days''\". Tolkien promises to send him a revised copy of the book \"''if there is a reprint''\", adding that \"''sales are not very great''\". He also writes: \"''To be fancied by you, that is more than any hobbit could have expected''\", and that his children have kept Ransome's books from when they were young.<ref name=CG/><ref name=Leeds>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/news/article/3305/tolkien_sales_are_not_very_great|articlename=Tolkien: \"Sales are not very great\"|dated=16 October 2012|website=[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/ University of Leeds]|accessed=21 October 2012}}</ref>\n*'''Description:''' Handwritten letter.<ref name=Leeds/>\n*'''Archive:''' The letter is kept at the [[University of Leeds]].<ref name=Leeds/>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Letter 20]]\n\n==External links==\n\n*[http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-19965058 JRR Tolkien letter reveals poor sales of The Hobbit] at BBC.com\n*[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/news/article/3305/ Tolkien: \"Sales are not very great\"] at Leeds.ac.uk\n*[http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/78192/1/Hall%26Kaislaniemi_editorille.pdf  ‘You tempt me grievously to a mythological essay’: J.
