Upon the summit stood a smooth black globe, the [[Stone of Erech]].\n\n== History ==\nThe Hill of Erech was a hill lying on the southern fringes of the [[White Mountains]], near the [[Mornan|source]] of the River [[Morthond]].\n\nIn the [[Second Age]], [[Isildur]] placed a great [[Stone of Erech|Black Stone]], upon the summit of the Hill of Erech.\n\nIt was there that the [[King of the Dead|King of the Mountains]] swore allegiance to Isildur's cause at the time of the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|Last Alliance]]. However, when he failed to fulfil his oath, he and his people were cursed to wander and haunt the hills as the [[Oathbreakers|Dead]] until they made good on their oath.\n\n[[File:Abe Papakhian - Oathbreakers, Why Have Ye Come.jpg|thumb|left|''Oathbreakers, Why Have Ye Come?'' by Abe Papakhian.]]\n\nThus, the Hill of Erech gained a sinister reputation, becoming a mysterious and eerie place, shunned by the people of the [[Blackroot Vale]], who claimed that it was haunted by the whispering Dead.<ref name=\"Grey\">{{RK|V2}}</ref>\n\nAfter waiting through the long years of the Third Age, at midnight on [[8 March]] {{TA|3019}},<ref name=\"Great\">{{App|Great}}</ref> the heir of Isildur, [[Aragorn]], came to the Hill of Erech to hold the Dead to their oath again, promising that upon its fulfillment they would have peace.<ref name=\"Grey\">{{RK|V2}}</ref> [[9 March|The next day]] they left the Hill of Erech for [[Calembel]].<ref name=\"Great\"/> Indeed, on [[13 March]],<ref name=\"Great\"/> they held true to their oath and formed the Host of the Dead, aiding Aragorn in the defeat of the [[Corsairs of Umbar]] at [[Pelargir]]. After the battle at Pelargir, Aragorn released them from their oath and they were allowed to rest.<ref>{{RK|V9}}</ref> The fate of the Hill of Erech during the [[Fourth Age]] is not known.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''Erech'', like so many names in Gondor, was of unknown [[Mannish]] [[pre-Númenórean]] origin.<ref>{{App|Men}}</ref>\n\n== Portrayal in adaptations ==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Hill of Erech.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Hill of Erech in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2010: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Hill of Erech sits in the middle of a populated valley, with the town of \"Morlad\" and the villages of \"Lancrath\", \"Sardol\", and \"Tingobel\" all located within sight of it.
