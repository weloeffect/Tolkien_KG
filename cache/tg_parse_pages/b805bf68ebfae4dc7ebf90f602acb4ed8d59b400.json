only being beaten in length by [[Dírhaval]]'s ''[[Narn i Chîn Húrin]]''.<ref name=long>{{LR|Quenta}}, p. 296</ref>\n\nBy the time of the late [[Third Age]], the ending of the lay was forgotten and only [[Elrond]] in [[Rivendell]] could remember it \"as it was told of old\".<ref name=excerpt/>\n\nWhen [[Aragorn]] saw [[Arwen]] in [[Rivendell]] for the first time, he sang an excerpt from the Lay of Lúthien telling of Beren and Lúthien's first meeting in the [[Forest of Neldoreth]].<ref name=name/>\n\nIn the year {{TA|3018}}, Aragorn sang the same excerpt on [[Weathertop]] in the [[Weather Hills]] to distract [[Frodo Baggins]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]], [[Peregrin Took]], and [[Samwise Gamgee]] from their fears. Afterwards, Aragorn summarized the lay and explained its history and form to the [[Hobbits]]. He also commented that his [[Westron]]-translated excerpt was \"but a rough echo of\" the original since the lay was difficult to translate.<ref name=excerpt/>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Anke Eißmann - Beren recovers a Silmaril.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Beren recovers a Silmaril'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]\nThe Lay tells the story of Beren's escape from [[Dorthonion]] after the loss of his father [[Barahir]]. Coming into the south, he entered [[Doriath]] and came across [[Lúthien|Lúthien Tinúviel]] in the woods. They desired to wed, but Lúthien's father, King [[Thingol]], set an impossible bride-price on his daughter—a [[Silmaril]] from the [[Iron Crown]] of [[Morgoth]] in the deepest pits of [[Angband]]. Beren set out on his hopeless quest with the aid of King [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]], but they were captured and imprisoned by [[Sauron]]. Lúthien came to their aid through many troubles of her own, and with the help of [[Huan the Hound]] she rescued Beren. Using her magical arts, they penetrated Angband and stole one of the Silmarils, but in their escape Beren's hand, holding the Silmaril, was bitten from his wrist by the great wolf [[Carcharoth]]. Eventually, the wolf was hunted and slain, and the Silmaril recovered, but only at the cost of Beren's life. Then Lúthien, too, passed away, and pleaded before Mandos himself. Both Beren and Lúthien were returned to life, and they dwelt in the south of [[Ossiriand]] for a time. Lúthien had become mortal herself, and she passed away at last with her beloved beyond the [[Circles of the World]].\n\n==Etymology==\n''Leithian'' means \"Release from Bondage\"<ref name=QS /> from the verb ''[[leithia]]'' (\"release\") from verb ''[[leith]]'' (\"set free\") ([[root]] [[LEK]]).<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 368, entry \"LEK-\"</ref>\n\n==Title==\nThe most likely meaning of the title can be found at one of the key moments in the poem, the point at which one of the Silmarils, the magical gems of Fëanor, is cut from the crown of Morgoth by Beren:\n\n{{blockquote|Behold! the hope of Elvenland<br />\nthe fire of Fëanor, Light of Morn<br />\nbefore the sun and moon were born,<br />\nthus out of bondage came at last,<br />\nfrom iron to mortal hand it passed.|[[Lay of Leithian Canto XIII|Canto XIII]], Verses 4-8}}\n\nThis moment is also central to the over-arching story-line of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', in which the gem is used to bring hope to the scattered peoples of Middle-Earth and is ultimately set in the heavens by the mariner [[Eärendil]] as a sign of their coming salvation.\n\nThe name of the poem is therefore likely an attempt to underscore the importance of the Lay relative to other tales from the first age.  Though honor, bravery and vengeance drive the Elven hosts forward to war with [[Morgoth]], it is only love that can overcome all obstacles to wrest a [[Silmaril]] from his crown.\n\n==Real world history==\n{{Main|The Lay of Leithian}}\nThe Lay is not a mere literary invention — it does substantially exist in English, in the form of iambic tetrameter, and is contained within volume III of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', appropriately named ''[[The Lays of Beleriand]]''. Though the extant lay runs to 4223 lines and fourteen [[Cantos of the Lay of Leithian|Cantos]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] never fully completed the poem. The fragment terminates right at one of the climactic moments of the tale, as Beren's hand is torn from the wrist by the monstrous guardian of Angband's gate, [[Carcharoth]].\n\n==See also==\n*\"[[Song of Beren and Lúthien|The leaves were long, the grass was green,]]\"\n*[[Cantos of the Lay of Leithian]]\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Lays and tales within the legendarium]]\n[[de:Leithian-Lied]]\n[[fr:encyclo/arts/chants et recits/lai de leithian]]\n[[fi:The Lay of Leithian]]"}}}
