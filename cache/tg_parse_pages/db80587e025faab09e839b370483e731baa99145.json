And now there's you.|Barliman Butterbur in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', \"[[At the Sign of the Prancing Pony]]\"}}\n\n'''Barliman Butterbur''' was a [[Men of Bree|Man of Bree]] who was the owner of ''[[The Prancing Pony]]''.\n\nA short, fat, red-faced [[Men|Man]], he appeared to have had a rather bad memory.<ref name=Sign>{{FR|Sign}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[The Prancing Pony]] in [[Bree]] was kept by the [[Butterbur Family]] for many generations and Barliman inherited it before the [[War of the Ring]].<ref>{{FR|Pipeweed}}</ref> He had two [[Bree-hobbits|hobbit]] employees: [[Bob]], who worked in the stables, and [[Nob]], a servant.<ref name=Sign/> \n\nDuring the War, [[Gandalf]] wrote a [[Gandalf's letter|letter]] to [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and told Barliman to send it to [[Hobbiton]]. Barliman could not find anyone for the task, and eventually forgot the letter altogether, leaving Frodo uncertain as to Gandalf's fate and causing him to start his journey much later than the letter indicated.<ref name=strider>{{FR|Strider}}</ref>\n\nHe did not remember it until autumn, when Frodo and his companions arrived to stay at the inn, and even then it was long before the connection was made. He did, however, remember to produce [[Aragorn|Strider]]'s credentials.<ref name=strider/>\n\nDuring the night of the hobbits' stay, the inn was attacked by the [[Black Riders]]. Barliman was dismayed by the terrible events of the night, and was further upset in the morning, when he discovered that the stable-doors had been opened, and all of the [[horses]] and [[ponies]] kept there had escaped. As compensation, he purchased the only [[Bill the pony|pony]] found to be available from [[Bill Ferny]], who demanded at least thrice its proper price. This he gave to the hobbits along with eighteen silver pennies, although the loss of the money was a harsh blow to him. Fortunately, many of the horses had only been set loose, and were found again later. [[Merry]]'s ponies fled to [[Tom Bombadil]], who eventually returned them to Barliman for use at the inn.<ref>{{FR|Knife}}</ref>\n\nWhen Gandalf finally arrived at The Prancing Pony, he was furious with Barliman's forgetfulness, but quickly forgave him when he found out the Hobbits were alive. He even went so far as to put a blessing on his beer.<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[War of the Ring]], Barliman was amazed to learn that Strider, a former patron of the Prancing Pony, had become king of [[Gondor]] and [[Arnor]].<ref>{{RK|Homeward}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nBarliman means \"barley-man\", a suitable name for an ale-brewer.<ref name=\"Nomen\">[[J.R.R.
