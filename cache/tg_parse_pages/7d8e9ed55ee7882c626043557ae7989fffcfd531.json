It traces those influences in Tolkien's scholarly and creative work, paying particular attention to some relatively neglected texts. The book draws on unpublished manuscripts and on Tolkien's own collection of Welsh books in order to evaluate the influence of Wales and Welsh on Tolkien's writings and on his sense of national identity.''\"<ref>[http://www.carlphelpstead.info/-tolkien-and-wales Tolkien and Wales] at [http://www.carlphelpstead.info/home Carlphelpstead.info] (accessed 11 June 2011)</ref>\n\n==From the publisher==\n{{blockquote|Tolkien once wrote: 'I love Wales - and especially the Welsh language'. This book explores how that love influenced Tolkien's ideas about language, many aspects of his creative writing, and his sense of an English identity. It describes more fully than before the extent and depth of Tolkien's debt to Welsh language and literature, and argues that Tolkien's love of Wales and Welsh is inseparable from his love of, and sense of belonging to, England. The book gives detailed attention to both Tolkien's fiction and his scholarly writings, including some relatively neglected texts. Wales and Welsh were seminal influences on the writings of the twentieth century's most popular writer and this book reveals the range and depth of these influences.}}\n\n==Unpublished manuscripts==\n\nPhelpstead draws upon the following unpublished manuscripts held at the [[Bodleian Library]] (quotes from the manuscripts are marked in bold):<ref>\"Bibliography\", p. 165</ref>\n\n*MS Tolkien 7-8 [papers relating to '[[English and Welsh]]'] (cf. p.
