After many days, they reached a guarded bridge over the [[Taeglin]] and decided to rest there. However, a roaming \"band of Orc-hunters\" attacked them unawares, causing Nienor to flee into [[Brethil]] in terror and confusion. When the Orc-hunters pursued her, she outran them and they were overtaken and killed by the [[Elves]].<ref name=band>{{CH|14}}</ref>\n\nOn [[16 March]] in the year {{TA|3019}} of the late [[Third Age]], [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]] spied two Orc-hunters<ref name=identity/> near the [[Sauron's Road|Barad-dûr Road]]<ref>''[[The Chronology of The Lord of the Rings]]'', p. 148</ref> having a disagreement twenty paces away from them regarding their mission. One of them stated that their bosses [[Barad-dûr|Higher Up]] kept changing their target; from an Elf to a [[Dwarves|dwarf]]-[[Men|man]], to even \"a pack of rebel [[Uruk-hai]]\" in the context of the [[Battle of Cirith Ungol|quarrel]] in the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]]. As a result of this, he suggested that it could be all three put together in fact. Following the disagreement, the snuffling Orc skillfully killed the larger one with an arrow and ran off to a nearby [[Orc-holds|Orc-hold]].<ref name=shadow/>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nIn a sketch predating the earliest form of the story of [[Túrin]], Nienor was driven into some woods by a baneful drink given to her by [[Kurúki]],<ref name=Kurúki>{{LT2|IIn}}, pp. 138-40</ref> instead of a group of Orc-hunters<ref name=band/>.\n\nIn a discarded revision of chapter five of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', [[Gollum]] is described as a \"foul orc-<illegible>\" by [[Bilbo Baggins]]. [[John D. Rateliff]] notes that, though the second half of the word is illegible, it was probably \"hunter\" and not \"thing\" because the word lacked \"a descender at the end\".<ref>{{HH|1947}}, i.
