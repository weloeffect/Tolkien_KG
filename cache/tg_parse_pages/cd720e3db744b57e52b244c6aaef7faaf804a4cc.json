[[Aratar]], also known as ''the Smith'' and ''Smith of the Valar'', concerned with rock, metal, nature of substances and works of craft.\n\n==Attributes==\nAulë governed the substances of the [[Ambar]] and he delighted in all works and crafts all of which he was master, from small works of skin to the forging of all lands and mountains and basins of the sea. He made the rocks, the gems and all minerals.<ref name=vala>{{S|IIb}}</ref> \n\nHe enjoyed devising and making new things, and being praised. In these thoughts and powers he was like [[Melkor]], as [[Ilúvatar]] gave him scarce less skill and knowledge. Aulë had always been faithful to Eru and submitted all his creations to His will. He was never jealous of others' creations, but sought and gave counsel. He enjoyed the things he has created and in act of making itself and passed ever to some new work, without hoarding or possessing. For this, there was much strife between him and Melkor who envied him; Melkor always marred his work and Aulë always sought to repair them.<ref name=vala/><ref name=ai>{{S|I}}</ref>\n\nHe was the third most powerful of the [[Aratar]]. He was husband to [[Yavanna]], with whom he [[Mansions of Aulë|dwelt]] in central [[Valinor]].\n\nSeveral [[Maiar]] are associated with Aulë: [[Sauron|Mairon]], before being corrupted by [[Morgoth|Melkor]] and becoming Sauron; and [[Saruman|Curumo]], who later went to [[Middle-earth]] as an [[Istar]] to combat the darkness, only to be swayed by the willpower of Sauron.\n\n==History==\nIn the [[Song of the Ainur]] Aulë thought most of the fabric of the Earth.<ref name=ai/> During the creation of [[Arda]], Aulë worked much with [[Manwë]] and [[Ulmo]];<ref name=ai/> Aulë fashioned the substances that composed [[Ambar]], and was most involved in building the continents and mountains.

[[Ilúvatar]] knew of this and even as Aulë was instructing them He chastened Aulë. Aulë humbly repented, offering his children to the will of Ilúvatar, whom He accepted as His adopted children. Since [[Ilúvatar]] had decided that the [[Elves]] were to be the first-born race, He put the Dwarves to sleep until the Elves [[Awakening of the Elves|woke]] on [[Arda]]. \n\nWhen the [[Elves]] came to [[Valinor]], the [[Noldor]] became the students of Aulë and his friends.<ref name=vala/> [[Fëanor]] was his greatest pupil, and from him learned the craft to make the [[Silmarils]].\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Aule.mp3|Ardamir}}\n''Aulë'' is said to derive from [[Valarin]] '''''Aȝūlēz'''''.<ref>{{WJ|AD1}}, p. 399</ref>\n\nIn the earlier ''[[The Etymologies|Etymologies]]'', the name apparently means \"invention\" in [[Quenya]], from [[root]] [[GAWA]].<ref name=Etymologies>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry \"GAWA\"</ref>\n\n==Other names==\nIn [[Khuzdul]], his name is '''''Mahal''''' (\"[[The Maker]]\").<ref>{{S|Aule}}</ref>\n\nSometimes he was called '''''Návatar''''',<ref>{{PM|XIII}}, \"Notes\", p. 391, note 22</ref> probably meaning \"Dwarf-father\" in Quenya.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1320168069.html|articlename=Q.
