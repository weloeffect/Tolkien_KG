It was located in the [[White Downs]] that lay within the [[Westfarthing]] on the [[East Road]], perhaps south to its smaller counterpart, the [[Little Delving]].<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref>  Although located within a hilly region the town had many above-ground houses of wood, brick, or stone. \n\nThis large town was unofficially considered to be more or less the Hobbits' \"capital\".<ref name=Hobbits>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>  The [[Mayor of Michel Delving]] (or of the Shire) was the only real official in the Shire, under whom were attached the offices of [[Postmaster]] and [[First Shirriff]] for the entire region.<ref>{{FR|Ordering}}</ref>  \n\nThe [[Town Hole]],<ref>{{FR|I9}}</ref> the museum known as the [[Mathom-house]],<ref name=Hobbits/> as well as the storage tunnels later known as [[Lockholes]],<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref> could be found in Michel Delving. \n\nDuring the occupation of the Shire, the [[Ruffians]] converted the storage tunnels into prisons. They also used the tunnels (as well as sheds and deserted holes) to store great amounts of foods and beer. On [[4 November]] {{TA|3019}} [[Frodo Baggins]] rode to Michel Delving and released the prisoners from the Lockholes. The Hobbits also appropriated the Ruffians's stores.<ref name=havens>{{RK|VI9}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nIts name means simply \"Large Excavation\", being derived from a possible [[Old English|Old Hobbitish]] ''Micel Delfing''.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=https://tolkienlistsearch.herokuapp.com/message/5e9c35b63ee6a6c41e9862d6|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]|accessed=3 May 2013}}</ref> \n\n''Michel'' is derived from [[Old English]] ''[[Wiktionary:micel|micel]]'', meaning \"great\". Since in Old English ''c'' is normally pronounced as modern ''ch'', here most probably the same pronunciation is kept, while its spelling is modernized. The same element also appears as ''mickle'', as in [[Mickleburg]].\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Michel Delving.jpg|thumb|left|Michel Delving in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Michel Delving is the chief settlement of the Shire. It contains various player facilities, such as vendors, notaries, vault-keepers, an auction house, a crafting area and a swift travel services. A wooden statue of [[Marcho]] and [[Blanco]] stands proudly in the center of the town. Michel Delving also boasts to have the largest tavern in all of the Shire, named [[Bird and Baby Inn]] in reference to [[The Eagle and Child]].\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Cities, towns and villages of the Shire]]\n\n[[de:Michelbinge]]\n[[fi:Järin Möyremä]]"}}}
