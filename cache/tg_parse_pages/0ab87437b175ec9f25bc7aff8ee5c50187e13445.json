When asked by Théoden if Denethor knew more than he said in his message, Hirgon said that he could not say what Denethor may know or guess. Théoden promised him to come himself with his troops of six thousand Riders would set out for Minas Tirith in the morning, and told to stay until the next day to witness the muster of the troops of Rohan, but that they would not reach Minas Tirith for a week. After witnessing the muster and discussing the necessary provisions for the Rohirrim for their ride, Hirgon and his companion rode back to Gondor on the next day.<ref name=Muster/> \n\nHowever on their way back they found their deaths. Reached the [[Rammas Echor]], they could not pass through it to reach their city, perhaps because of hostile forces; the two turned back westwards when they were killed between the Grey Wood and the [[Rammas Echor]]. His head was hewn off, still clutching the Red Arrow.<ref name=\"Ride\"/>\n\nOn [[14 March]] {{TA|3019}}<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019, March 14, p. 1093</ref> the riders of Rohan reached the Grey Wood and camped there. [[Elfhelm]] reported to Théoden that scouts found two Gondorian dead messengers and two dead horses between the Grey Wood and the Rammas Echor, and that maybe one of them was Hirgon, because the corpse's head had been hewn off, but the Red Arrow was still held in his hand. They found signs that indicated that the two message riders of Gondor were riding back westwards when they were killed; in the opinion of Elfhelm the two message riders of Gondor reached the Rammas [[12 March|two days earlier]] (supposing they obtained fresh horses from the posts as message riders usually did), but that they could not pass through it to reach Minas Tirith, because it had either already been taken by or was already under attack by the forces of Sauron and that the two riders had turned back westwards. As a result Théoden concluded that Denethor had not received his message that the Riders of Rohan were coming and would despair that the Rohirrim would not come to help Minas Tirith.<ref name=\"Ride\">{{RK|Ride}}, p. 835</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nHirgon was a grey-eyed tall man. When [[Merry]] first saw him he thought he was [[Boromir]], but then realised that he looked like as if he were one of his kin. Hirgon wore a dark green cloak over a mailcoat with a helm with a small silver star on its front. His companion was shorter and broader and dressed like him and looked to Merry to be like Hirgon.<ref name=Muster/>\n\n==Etymology==\n'''''Hirgon''''' is apparently a [[Sindarin]] name of unclear meaning. David Salo suggested it might be a combination of ''[[hîr]]'' (\"lord\")<ref>{{L|297}}, paragraph about the name ''Rohan''</ref><ref>{{L|211}}, paragraph about the names ''Elrohir, Elladan''</ref> and ''-gon'' (\"commander\").<ref>{{PM|XINotes}}, note 36</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2773334915.html|articlename=S. ''Hirgon'' m.|website=Eldamo|accessed=12 May 2024}}</ref><ref>{{HM|GS}}, entry '''Hirgon''', p. 352</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nIn the first very rough draft version of the chapter ''The Muster of Rohan'' the messenger that was sent by Denethor to Théoden is briefly mentioned as \"Halbarad sister-son of Denethor\". In that draft it is not mentioned that he introduced himself to Denethor or that he is questioned by Théoden if Denethor knew more than he said.<ref>{{WR|II}}, ''(ii) The Muster of Rohan'', original draft 'A', p. 236</ref> It is possible that J.R.R. Tolkien abandoned the idea that the messenger was the son of the sister of Denethor, because it is not mentioned in the subsequent versions and he simply introduces himself as an errand-rider of Denethor and responds to Théoden's question that he cannot say what Denethor may know or guess in the published version.\n\nIn ''The Lord of the Rings'' drafts from the 1940s, this character was first named ''Dirgon''.<ref>{{WR|3|V}}, p. 316</ref>\n\n== Portrayal in adaptations ==\n'''2003: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''\n:The voice of Hirgon is provided by Roman Pomajbo.\n\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Hirgon.jpg|thumb|Hirgon's body in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2015: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Hirgon's body can be found outside the northern wall of the Rammas in the pre-battle version of Minas Tirith. The player learns that Denethor had seen the body of the messenger in the palantir and had come to the believe that Hirgon had never even reached Rohan and that no aid would come to the city.\n\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:Gondorians]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[de:Hirgon]]\n[[fi:Hirgon]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/hommes/3a/dunedain/gondoriens/hirgon]]"}}}
