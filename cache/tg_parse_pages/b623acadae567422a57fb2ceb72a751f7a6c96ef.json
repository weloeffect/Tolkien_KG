Making up the bulk of his manpower, they had settled in the pits within the Ring of [[Isengard]] and were sent to harass and assail the neighboring kingdom of [[Rohan]].\n\n==History==\nSaruman began to draw [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] to his service as mercenaries as early as {{TA|2990}},<ref name=\"Eorl\">{{App|Eorl}}, p. 1070</ref> and these troops were kept in the muddy pits tunnelled beneath Isengard in preparation for Saruman's attack on Rohan.<ref>{{UT|Palantiri}}, Note 7</ref> The fiercest and largest of those in the service of the [[White Hand]] were the fighting [[Uruk-hai]], perilous black Orc-soldiers of great size and strength.<ref name=\"Eorl\"/><ref>{{App|Other}}, p. 1131</ref> However, even although these Uruks still disliked it, they were resistant to sunlight,<ref name=\"Treebeard\">{{TT|Treebeard}}, p. 473</ref> presumably due to an exhaustive training.<ref>{{TT|Uruk}}, p. 449</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the wizard fell so terribly low in his corruption and malice that he also experimented with cross-breeding of Orcs with [[Men]] to improve Orkish stock, and thus [[Half-orcs]] and [[Goblin-men]] appeared, being large, treacherous, vile, and cunning.<ref>{{MR|P5X}}, pp. 418-9</ref> These Isendardes indeed resembled more wicked Men than 'pure' Orcs.<ref name=\"Treebeard\"/><ref>{{TT|Flotsam}}, p. 566</ref>\n\nAfter renouncing the [[White Council]] and secretly becoming the duplicitous servant of [[Sauron|the Enemy]] in {{TA|3000}},<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> Saruman began to harass the kingdom of Rohan by throwing in with its enemies. As the Shadow of Sauron extended, Orcs began to pillage the eastern villages of the [[Rohirrim]] and were joined by others from the Misty Mountains, some being in the service of Saruman such as great Uruks.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>\n\nHe continued to gather Orcs, among them [[Wolf-riders]], to Isengard by the time he held [[Gandalf]] captive in [[Orthanc]].<ref name=\"FRCouncil\">{{FR|Council}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[War of the Ring]], Saruman sent a large force of Orcs, including two armour-clad battalions of black Uruks, backed by [[Dunlendings]] in {{TA|3019}} in the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]], with Prince [[Théodred]] being slain per his special order. This was done both to allow him and his master, Sauron, full control over Rohan as part of the latter's war on the West, but also to more easily allow Saruman himself to dispatch parties of Orcs on routes the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] was likely to take. Such a troop joined by [[Orcs of Mordor]] and \"northerners\" ambushed the company at [[Amon Hen]], mortally-wounding [[Boromir]] and capturing the halflings [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and [[Peregrin Took]]. Near the eaves of [[Fangorn Forest]] however, the Orcs were attacked by the Riders of Rohan led by [[Éomer]] and slain to the last.<ref>{{TT|Riders}}</ref>\n\nSaruman's host overwhelmed Rohirrim defenders in the [[Second Battle of the Fords of Isen]], allowing his army of ten thousand Orcs (mostly Uruk-hai) reinforced by Dunlending hordes to push through towards [[Helm's Deep]] where King [[Théoden]] had chosen to make his stand. Though initially gaining the upper hand due to superior numbers and the machinery they had, the [[Battle of the Hornburg]] ended with the crushing defeat of Saruman's forces. Bitter at the destruction the wizard had dealt to their forest, the [[Ents]] of [[Fangorn Forest|Fangorn]] set out towards Isengard, laying down the walls, crushing the Orcs and flooding the fortress. \n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Orcs]]\n[[Category:Servants of Saruman]]"}}}
