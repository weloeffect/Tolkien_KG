They ran 600 miles (965 kilometers) from [[Thrihyrne]] in the north-west to [[Mindolluin]] and [[Hill of Guard|Amon Tirith]] in the east. A low spur sprung off south-west, and ended at [[Ras Morthil]].\n\n==Geographic features==\n===Important peaks===\nThe mountain range’s notable peaks were, from west to east, [[Thrihyrne]], [[Starkhorn]], [[Dwimorberg]], [[Írensaga]], [[Amon Anwar|Halifirien]], [[Calenhad]], [[Min-Rimmon]], [[Erelas]], [[Nardol]], [[Eilenach]], [[Amon Dîn]], [[Mindolluin]] and [[Amon Tirith]].\n\nAt the foot of Thrihyrne was the valley known as [[Helm's Deep]], and the [[Glittering Caves]] of Aglarond were underneath its spurs.\n\nThe three mountains Starkhorn, Dwimorberg and Irensaga enclosed the valley of [[Dunharrow]], and the Dwimorberg was also the home of the [[Paths of the Dead]].\n\nHalifirien, Calenhad, Min-Rimmon, Erelas, Nardol, Eilenach, and Amon Dîn were strategically chosen hilltops on the northern side of the range. They were the [[Warning beacons of Gondor]]. There was probably a beacon-row on the south side too.\n\n===Passes===\nThere were passes over the White Mountains, and many of the kin of [[Nimrodel]] are said to have been lost there.<ref name=Amroth>{{UT|Amroth}}</ref> \n\n===Rivers===\nThere are multiple rivers which have their sources issuing forth from the White Mountains.\n\nOn the Western facing (from North to South);\n* [[Adorn]]\n* [[Lefnui]]\nOn the Northern facing (from West to East);\n* [[Deeping-stream]]\n* [[Snowbourn]]\n* [[Mering Stream]] \nOn the Southern facing (from West to East);\n* [[Morthond]]\n* [[Ciril]]\n* [[Ringló]]\n* [[Gilrain]]\n* [[Serni]]\n* [[Celos]]\n* [[Erui]]\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nA local legend among the [[Pre-Númenóreans|indigenous people]] of [[Gondor]] told of [[giants]] making the mountains to keep [[Men]] out of their lands by the [[Belegaer|Sea]]. One of them, [[Stiffneck]] or [[Tarlang]] died there and some peaks are his [[Tarlang's Neck|neck]] and [[Dol Tarlang|head]]; the stones he was carrying were known as [[Cûl Veleg]] and [[Cûl Bîn]].<ref>[[J.R.R.

Hammond]], [[Christina Scull]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', pp. 536-7</ref>\n\n===Inhabitants===\nThroughout history the White Mountains were inhabited primarily by Men, including the [[Drúedain]], [[Dunlendings]], [[Rohirrim]], and [[Gondor]]ians; but also at times by [[Orcs]] and in the Fourth Age by [[Dwarves]].\n\nThe Drúedain lived along its northern edges, leaving [[Púkel-men]] at [[Starkhorn]] and [[Drúwaith Iaur]]. They resettled to a forest that would later be named after them: [[Drúadan Forest|Tawar in-Drúedain]].\n\nIn the [[Second Age]], the White Mountains were populated by a people related to the Dunlendings who had been servants of [[Sauron]]. They swore allegiance to [[Isildur]], but betrayed him and were cursed: they became known as the [[Oathbreakers]].\n\nThe valley on the southern side were under the rule of the [[Kings of Gondor|King of Gondor]], and the lords of [[Blackroot Vale]], [[Ringló Vale]], [[Tumladen (Gondor)|Tumladen]] and [[Lossarnach]] were loyal fiefs.<ref name=rkmap/>\n\nFrom {{TA|2510}}, the northern vales and hills became under the rule of the Rohirrim, mighty horse-lords from the North. They settled in [[Helm's Deep]], [[Dunharrow]] and [[Grimslade]], and built their capital [[Edoras]] on an outlying hill.<ref name=rkmap>{{RK|Map}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] in {{TA|2799}}, thousands of [[orcs]] fled south and troubled Rohan for two generations. Although the [[Rohirrim]] fought them off, some Orcs managed to reach the Mountains; King [[Walda]] was killed by an Orc at [[Dunharrow]].<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>\n\nIn the early [[Fourth Age]], [[Gimli]], son of [[Glóin]] led a colony of [[Dwarves]] and settled in the [[Glittering Caves]], of which he had discovered the value during the [[Battle of the Hornburg]].<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[Sindarin]] name of the White Mountains, '''''Ered Nimrais''''', consists of ''[[ered]]'' (\"mountains\") and ''nimrais'' (\"white-peaks; pale-horns\").<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 33</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nIn drafts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', these mountains are initially referred to as the '''South Mountains'''<ref>{{RS|Elrond}}</ref>{{rp|400}} and '''Black Mountains'''.<ref>{{RS|Index}}</ref>{{rp|472}}\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''\n:In the scene [[The Lighting of the Beacons]] Gondor calls to Rohan for aid, the film then depicts the beacons being lit one by one along various peaks on the northern side of the White Mountains until the final beacon is sighted by [[Aragorn]] in [[Edoras]]. \n\n== Portrayal in adaptations ==\n'''2013: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The White Mountains are prominently features across the skyline of [[Rohan]] and [[Gondor]] and also contain several dwarven strongholds. \"Furukzahar\" of the [[Blacklocks|Temámir]] dwarves lies directly north of [[Pelargir]], while \"Zigil-jâbal\" and \"Kechel\" of unknown allegiance are located in the western reaches of the White Mountains and are not yet in-game.\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Gondor]]\n[[Category:Mountain ranges]]\n[[Category:Rohan]]\n[[Category:White Mountains]]\n[[de:Weißes Gebirge]]\n[[fi:Valkoiset Vuoret]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/reliefs/montagnes blanches]]"}}}
