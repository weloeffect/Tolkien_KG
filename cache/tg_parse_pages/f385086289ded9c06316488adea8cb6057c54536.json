It was not featured in the theatrical release of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''.\n==Synopsis==\n[[Théoden]]'s army learns from their scouts that [[Minas Tirith]] is surrounded. Amongst the troops are [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Éowyn]]. Both were supposed to have stayed behind and came in secret. Éowyn tells Merry to take heart because it well soon be over. Merry tells Éowyn that she is fair and brave and has a lot to live for. He says there is not much point in hoping, He is not a knight of great deeds, he is a hobbit. He says he knows he can't save [[Middle-earth]], he just wants to help his friends. Théoden announces that they are going to move out and they ride to battle.\n==Differences==\nMost of this scene was only in the movies. Merry did not realize that the rider that brought him along, [[Dernhelm]] was Éowyn until she fought the [[Witch-king]] during the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].<ref>{{RK|Battle}}</ref> This conversation did not happen, in fact Éowyn spoke very little to Merry.<ref>{{RK|Ride}}</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King scenes|39]]"}}}
