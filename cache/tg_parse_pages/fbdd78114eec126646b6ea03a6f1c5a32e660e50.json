I say ‘fortunately’, because though I dislike talking (in this sense), lecturing, or addressing a gathering, I should have been sorry to refuse your invitation: you sugar the central pill so attractively. I should be delighted to visit Deddington and have lunch with you; and I fear that the fee will be more than ample for the performance. Short? Ten minutes? A quarter of an hour?<br/><br/>I will consult you later, if I may, on the sort of thing likely to be most appropriate.<br/><br/>As for my own writings: beside the two you name there is Farmer Giles of Ham (Allen & Unwin), specially appropriate, since it is localized in Oxfordshire. Other poems and stories are, I fear, either scattered in periodicals or o.p.2 and await collection. Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (Clarendon Press), since it is an edition of a mediaeval poem, would, I imagine, be regarded as too technical, specially as I have not yet published the translation which has twice been broadcast.<br/><br/>It would be most kind if you could send a car, as I have none of my own now and have in consequence seldom visited Deddington, in post-war years, though I used often to do so.<br/><br/>Yours sincerely,<br/><br/>J.R.R. Tolkien<br/><br/>P.S.   I wonder if Mrs. Lionel Hitchens is the mother of Miss Phoebe Hitchens, whom I have met, since my daughter knew her. She was, I think, the cousin (?) of the woman novelist of the same name - (Noughts and Crosses …etc.).<br/>JRR T.}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[The Banbury Advertiser 19 December 1956|''The Banbury Advertiser'' 19 December 1956]]\n*[[Letter to Miss Stanley-Smith (19 December 1956)]]\n*[[Oxford Mail 15 December 1956|''Oxford Mail'' 15 December 1956]]\n{{references}}\n{{title}}\n[[Category:Letters|Stanley-Smith, Miss (1956-11-22)]]"}}}
