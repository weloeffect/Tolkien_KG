It's unspecified on why Thorin had a meeting with all houses of the Dwarves, however it's likely for the purpose of declaring war on [[Smaug]] and to reclaim his homeland. \n\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Ironfists.jpg|thumb|The \"Zhélruka\" in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2018: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n: The House corresponding to the Ironfists is called the '''Zhélruka''', meaning \"iron hand\" in old Slavonic on which their \"outer\" names are based. The Zhélruka were the first of major Houses (other than Longbeards) to be introduced to the game, which greatly fleshed out their history, culture, language and even the unique writing system. They style themselves with elaborate moustaches and mutton chops instead of beards and fight with curved swords instead of axes. Their banners depict an iron gauntlet wielding a war-gammer.\n\n: The Zhélruka awoke in the east and fought with [[Stiffbeards|Kámbrada]] over the mountains of [[Orocarni|Ered Cernin]]. Their homes destroyed at the end of the [[First Age]], they were granted leave to dwell in [[Gundabad]] by [[Durin II]], but the refugees never arrived, becoming lost in the [[Grey Mountains]]. A widespread legend among the Zhélruka was the existence of their lost city in the [[Grey Mountains]] that rivaled [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]]: \"Thafar-gathol, the Grey Citadel\". A proud culture with a distrust of outsiders, the Zhélruka had a long history with the Longbeards that varied between alliance and enmity. Their kings wielded the [[Seven Rings|Ring]] \"Tínya\" until it was devoured by the [[Cold-drakes|Cold-dragon]] \"Hrímil Frost-heart\".\n\n: When [[Thráin|Thráin II]] called the dwarves to war, \"King Vélat\" led the Zhélruka from their home in \"[[Orocarni|Ered Cernin]]\". Vélat fell in the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] and was succeeded by his son \"Vékun II\". Shortly after [[Sauron]]'s downfall, Vékun's son \"Prince Ingór\", brother of \"King Ótek VII\", led an expedition into the Grey Mountains and formed an uneasy partnership with the Longbeard expedition he encountered there. Ingór's dwarves helped the Longbeards secure an abandoned stronghold in Ered Mithrin and joined Prince [[Durin VII|Durin]]'s campaign to reclaim Gundabad, although Ingór's host answered only to him. The dwarves were eventually successful and [[Durin VII]] reinforced [[Durin II|his own decree]] by allowing Zhélruka to dwell within Gundabad.\n\n{{references}}\n{{dwarvenclans}}"}}}
