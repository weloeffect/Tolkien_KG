The work aims to establish a complete list of books that once existed on [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s shelves, which he either read, owned, borrowed, or consulted.\n\nThough not designed for ordinary reading, the book is welcomed by scholars for providing a guide to Tolkien's mind and pointing out directions for future studies. It was the winner of the Best Book award of the [[Tolkien Society Awards]] [[2020]], and a finalist for the [[Wikipedia:Mythopoeic Awards|Mythopoeic Scholarship Award]] in Inklings Studies [[2021]].\n\nThe main checklist contains some 2600 entries, which forms the bulk of the book. Also included here are: a list of Tolkien's published writings in his lifetime; his interviews and reviews; student papers that he examined; publications by the [[wikipedia:Early English Text Society|Early English Text Society]] when he was a member; and his lecture schedules in [[University of Leeds|Leeds]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].\n\nA second edition of the book was published in [[2023]], with addition of more than 400 new entires, an afterword by [[Verlyn Flieger]], and a newly discovered poem by [[Geoffrey Bache Smith|G.B. Smith]] not included in ''[[A Spring Harvest]]''.\n\n==Contents==\n*Ackowledgements\n*Foreword to the First Edition - [[Tom Shippey]]\n*Preface\n*Introduction to the Second Edition\n*A tribute to G.B.

Tolkien than about almost any other author, from any period. Nevertheless, in spite of all the efforts, there remains a certain opacity about Tolkien, both professionally and personally.\n\nAs this book shows, there is a way to bridge that gap which has not been previously attempted: a fact which makes this work by Oronzo Cilli arguably the work with most potential for giving us a truer understanding of Tolkien; a work which, besides its own immediate effect, points the way for many further studies. What Oronzo has done is, quite simply, to collect what is known about the books Tolkien owned and read.\n\nThe best guide to an author's mind is through his books, and in the work of Oronzo Cilli we have now the best and most valuable guide to Tolkien's books. It is a devoted, enduring, and above all inspirational work of scholarship, but not, as Oronzo knows, a final one. It joins that very select group of works, the most useful of all: a book we should keep, update, and write notes in the margin of, for the rest of our lives.\" — Tom Shippey}}\n\n==Publication history and gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"125px\" heights=\"125px\">\nFile:Tolkien's Library 2019.jpeg|2019 first edition\nFile:Tolkien's Library 2023.jpeg|2023 second edition\n</gallery>\n*Luna Press Publishing, hardcover ([[2019]]), pp.&nbsp;466.
