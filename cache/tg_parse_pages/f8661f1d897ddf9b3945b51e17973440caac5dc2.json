This name was used for the flowers that [[Tuor]] found growing around the [[Gate of Silver]] on the journey into [[Gondolin]], and is not recorded after the end of the [[First Age]]. Texts referring to the [[Third Age]] seem to prefer the Elvish name '''[[alfirin]]''' for the same white, star-like flower, but whether this signals a change of name across the ages is not known. \n\nThe [[Sindarin]] word ''uilos'' is not literally equivalent to \"Evermind\", but rather has a meaning closer to \"''Everwhite''\". The \"Ever-\" element in both these names alludes to the fact that the flowers didn't have a particular season, but instead appeared throughout the entire year.\n\n[[Category:Flowers]]\n[[Category:Sindarin nouns]]\n[[de:Simbelmyne]]\n[[fr:encyclo:biologie:flore:uilos]]\n[[fi:Uilos]]"}}}
