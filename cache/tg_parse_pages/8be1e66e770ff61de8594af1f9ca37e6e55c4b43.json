The sound of the album differs from the first two Battlelore albums as the instrumentation has a more live and organic feel and also due to the absence of clean male vocals.\n==Track listing==\n#\"[[Usvainen Rhûn]]\" - 1:36\n#\"Storm of the Blades\" - 3:22\n#\"[[Ghân of the Woods]]\" - 4:41\n#\"[[Gwaith-i-Mírdain (song)|Gwaith-i-Mírdain]]\" - 3:43\n#\"[[Trollshaws (song)|Trollshaws]]\" - 4:07\n#\"[[Elves of Lúva]]\" - 4:39\n#\"[[Valier - Queens of the Valar]]\" - 4:19\n#\"[[Thousand Caves (song)|Thousand Caves]]\" - 4:06\n#\"Cloaked In Her Unlight\" - 4:13\n#\"[[Of Orcs and Elves]]\" - 4:26\n#\"Touch of Green and Gold\" - 3:39\n#\"[[Pallando - Forgotten Wizards I]]\" - 3:31\n#\"[[Gollum's Cry]]\" - 3:04\n#\"Elessar's Call (Bonus Track)\" - 4:11\n#\"Alatar - Forgotten Wizards II (Bonus Track)\" - 3:33\n#\"Dwimmerlaik (Bonus Track)\" - 4:28\n\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Albums]]"}}}
