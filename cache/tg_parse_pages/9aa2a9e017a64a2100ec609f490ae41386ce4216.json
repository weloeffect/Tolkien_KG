Tolkien]] never completed.\n\nIn the published story the wizard rode up to the [[Thorin and Company|Company]] on the first day on a white horse (bringing [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo's]] pocket-handkerchiefs, pipe, and tobacco to the hobbit),<ref>{{H|Mutton}}</ref> but this steed was never named.  There was no mention of any special abilities for this horse and it was left in [[Rivendell]] when the Company ascended the [[Misty Mountains]]; for the climb [[Elrond]] had lent Gandalf a pony, a \"jolly sturdy little white fellow\" since \"his horse was not suitable for the mountain-paths\".<ref>{{H|Hill}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1960 rewrite the white horse was named Rohald.<ref>{{HH|NC2}}, p. 791</ref>  With Rohald, Gandalf used no stirrups and seldom used the reins, and the horse answered his commands spoken in a strange tongue.  Rohald was the leader of the ponies; at the broken bridge he crossed the river and neighed to encourage the Dwarves' ponies to follow,<ref>{{HH|NC2}}, p. 793</ref> and on the night of the Trolls he gathered the wandering ponies and looked after them.<ref>{{HH|NC2}}, p. 800</ref>  The 1960 version ended as the Company approached Rivendell so whether or not Rohald was to accompany Gandalf after visiting the [[Last Homely House]] is unknown.  However, a final note to the unfinished chapter 3 stated that \"Róhald belonged to Rivendell, & had been lent by [[Elrond]] to Gandalf\".<ref>{{HH|NC3}}, p. 803</ref> [Only in the note was the 'o' in Rohald accented.]\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Horses]]\n[[fi:Rohald]]"}}}
