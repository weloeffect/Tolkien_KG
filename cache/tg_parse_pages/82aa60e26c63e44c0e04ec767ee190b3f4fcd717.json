In {{TA|2951}} he declared himself openly, gathered forces and fortified [[Mordor]].<ref name=\"AppB3\" />\n\nIn {{TA|3009|n}} [[Gollum]] was captured after he had ventured into [[Mordor]] and the Dark Lord learned that his Ring was in [[the Shire]], a location unknown to him. Gollum was released from Mordor in {{TA|3017|n}} and was soon taken by [[Aragorn]] in the [[Dead Marshes]].<ref name=\"AppB3\" /> His capture alarmed Sauron, causing him to send the [[Nazgûl]] out to attack the deserted ruins of [[Osgiliath]] and hunt for the Ring. Sauron had two purposes in making this assault: First, to test the strength and preparedness of [[Denethor]] (which was found to be greater than he hoped); and second (and more importantly) to make the appearance of the Nazgûl seem to be only part of his war policy against [[Gondor]], in order to conceal from the [[Wise]] their mission to hunt for [[the One Ring]].<ref name=\"hunt\">{{UT|Hunt}}</ref>\n\nDays before the attack, the sons of Denethor, [[Boromir]] and [[Faramir]], had a [[Seek for the Sword that was broken|prophetic dream]].<ref name=\"council\" />\n===Battle===\nAt the [[Council of Elrond]], [[Boromir]] recounted this battle as a sudden attack in which the men of Gondor were outnumbered by the forces of Mordor with their allies, the [[Easterlings]] and [[Haradrim]].  However, he attributed Gondor's defeat to a power that had not been felt before, issuing from a great black horseman.  Only a remnant of Gondor's eastern force survived.  The last bridge across the [[Anduin]] was defended by a company led by Boromir and [[Faramir]] until the structure was destroyed.  Only the two brothers and two others survived by swimming.<ref name=\"council\">{{FR|Council}}</ref>\n\nAfter the eastern portion of Osgiliath was taken and the bridge broken, Sauron broke off the assault, ordering the Nazgûl to begin their search for the Ring.<ref name=\"hunt\" />\n===Aftermath===\n[[Mirkwood]] was raided on the same day, probably in a scheduled attack, as the captured [[Gollum]] found an opportunity to escape during the chaos.<ref name=\"AppB3\" />\n\nThe battle allowed the Black Riders to set forth and search for the One Ring in the west. \n\nNews of the defeat and the [[Black Shadow]] reached [[Eriador]] and the borders of [[the Shire]] by the end of [[June]]. [[Gandalf]] had an uneasy feeling when he got those messages and when he talked with refugees from the South he felt that they had a fear of which they didn't talk.<ref name=\"council\" />\n\nIt was the first conflict of the War of the Ring. Sauron found Denethor's forces stronger than he expected.<ref name=\"hunt\" /> For months thereafter Sauron continued to amass his forces in Mordor preparing for a full assault against Gondor.<ref>{{TT|IV4}}</ref> However when he discovered the [[Heir of Isildur]], his plans were altered<ref>{{RK|V2}}</ref> and proceeded hastily with his ready forces; [[Faramir's defence of Osgiliath|another skirmish occurred in Osgiliath]] leading up to the [[Siege of Gondor]].\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers - Boromir in Osgiliath.png|thumb|Boromir raises a flag of Gondor.]] \n'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (extended edition)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'' (extended edition)]]:'''\n:In the extended edition, [[Faramir]] has [[Sons of the Steward|a flashback]] of himself and [[Boromir|his brother]] in Osgiliath in the aftermath of a victorious battle; unlike in the book, the Gondorians here successfully fended off Sauron's forces and a multitude of soldiers (whereas in the book there was a handful of survivors) shout while Boromir is on a high wall and raises the [[standard of Elendil]]. As the soldiers celebrate their victory with ale, [[Denethor|Denethor II]] brought up the matter of [[the One Ring]] and sent Boromir to [[Rivendell]], expressing his trust and preference to him rather than Faramir. This scene seems to explain Faramir's treatment of [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] in the movie, as he intends to deliver the Ring to Denethor hoping to be seen in a better light.\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Conflicts of the War of the Ring]]"}}}
