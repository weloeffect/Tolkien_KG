This scene was extended in the latter edition.\n{{title}}\n==Synopsis==\n[[Frodo]] stands by the river wishing the [[The One Ring|Ring]] had never come to him. He recalls the words of [[Gandalf]] in [[Moria]]: ''\"So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us\"''. Finding strength, the hobbit resolves to continue his journey to [[Mordor]], gets in a boat and begins to cross the river to reach the eastern shore. \n\n[[Sam]] rushes to the river and finds Frodo going to Mordor alone. As he runs into the river, Frodo tells him to go back as he cannot swim, but Sam refuses to listen and begins to drown. Frodo turns back and pulls him into the boat. Sam tells Frodo that he made a promise:<ref group=note>In the film trilogy, the promise Sam refers to is made to Gandalf. This is mentioned by Sam to Frodo in the scene [[A Short Cut to Mushrooms (scene)|A Short Cut to Mushrooms]].</ref> ''\"Don't you leave him Samwise Gamgee. And I don't mean to.\"'' Frodo accepts that Sam won't be turned away and the two hobbits embrace.\n\nAfter putting [[Boromir]] into a funeral boat and sending his body down-river, [[Legolas]] gets ready to follow Frodo and Sam, however Aragorn decides not to follow them whilst [[Merry]] and [[Pippin]] are captured. They pledge to hold true to each other and begin their hunt of the [[Uruk-hai]] that took Merry and Pippin.\n\nFrodo and Sam top a rise overlooking the [[Emyn Muil]] with the borders of Mordor visible in the distance. Frodo ponders whether they will ever see the others again. ''\"We may yet, Mr Frodo\"'', Sam says. Frodo turns to look at him, smiling, and says ''\"I'm glad you're with me\"''. \n\n==Differences==\nThe overall narrative pertaining to Frodo and Sam follows the events that occur at the end of the chapter [[The Breaking of the Fellowship]], in that Sam decides to follow Frodo, begins to drown, and is saved by Frodo who eventually acquiesces to Sam joining him in the journey to Mordor. A minor difference when compared to the source material is that, in the book, Frodo wears the Ring<ref name = \"FR Breaking, pp. 405-6\"/> as he takes the boat by himself towards [[Anduin|the river]] before Sam joins him. Furthermore, the dialogue that occurs between Frodo and Sam at the end of this scene after they have crossed the river occurs ''before'' they have crossed the river at the close of the book chapter.<ref name = \"FR Breaking, pp. 405-6\">{{FR|Breaking}}, pp. 405-6</ref>\n\n{{references|note}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring scenes|46]]"}}}
