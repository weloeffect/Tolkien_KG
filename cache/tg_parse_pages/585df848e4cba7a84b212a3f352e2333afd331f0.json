Tolkien]], [[Nancy Smith]], \"[[Index questions]]\"</ref> The [[East Road]] was to the south of the marshes.\n\nOn October 2, 3018 [[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]] led his [[Hobbits|hobbit]] companions into the marshes on their third day out from Bree. After spending two days and nights in the marshes it was evident why there were no inhabitants. The land was boggy and dangerous with no permanent path. Pools, reeds, and rushes filled the area which was home to birds, flies, tiny biting midges, and loud cricket-like insects which [[Samwise Gamgee]] referred to as ''[[Neekerbreekers]]''.<ref>{{FR|I11}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe Midgewater Marshes were named after the small, gnat-like insects called midges which lived in there.<ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] (HarperCollins''Publishers'' 2008), ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', p. 167</ref>\n\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] stated that the name ''Midgewater Marshes'' was a translation of Icelandic ''Mývatn'' (which appears in ''[[Wikipedia:Hrafnkels Saga|Hrafnkels Saga]]'').<ref>[[J.R.R.
