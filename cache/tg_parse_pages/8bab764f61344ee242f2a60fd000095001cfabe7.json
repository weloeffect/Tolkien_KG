Tolkien]], as well as fantasy and science fiction in general. He describes himself as a \"Tolkien polemicist\".<ref>Email from Tom Shippey (as of 17 February 2012) to [[User:Morgan]].</ref>\n\n==Life==\n===Youth===\nThomas Alan Shippey was born to the engineer Ernest Shippey and his wife Christina Emily Kjelgaard in [[Wikipedia:Calcutta|Calcutta]], [[Wikipedia:British Raj|British India]], where his father worked as a bridge builder. He spent the first several years of his life there.<ref name=\"hanley\">Paul Hanley, [http://media.www.unewsonline.com/media/storage/paper953/news/2008/02/08/News/Let-Us.Introduce.You.To.Thomas.Shippey.Ph.d-3198399.shtml ''Let us introduce you to ... Thomas Shippey, Ph.D.'']</ref> When his father came back from the bridge, he transferred Shippey to a strict boarding school in Scotland, where he attended at [[King Edward's School]] in [[Birmingham]] from 1954 to 1960.<ref name=\"Preface\">Tom Shippey, ''[[The Road to Middle-earth]]'', Preface to the Third Edition</ref> \n\nHere he was introduced to science fiction, and ''[[The Hobbit]]'', which was lent to him when he was 14 years old.<ref name=\"white\">Claire E. White, [http://www.writerswrite.com/journal/mar02/shippey.htm ''Talking Tolkien With Thomas Shippey]''</ref> Shippey quickly developed an affinity for [[Old English]], Old Norse, German and Latin (like Tolkien) and playing rugby (like Tolkien), and he was able to afford ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' when he won a school contest.<ref name=\"hanley\"/>\n\n===Academic career===\nShippey did not immediately pursue an academic career after graduation, as the British economy in the early 1960s did not offer much work. Not until the mid-sixties did he enroll in [[Cambridge]].<ref name=\"white\"/> His first academic work on Tolkien was from late 1969 or early 1970. Shippey, a junior lecturer at the University of Birmingham, was asked to speak at a Tolkien day organised by a student association. That lecture, \"Tolkien as philologist\", would form Shippey's view of Tolkien - a philologist - for years to come. Unbeknownst to him, [[Joy Hill]], the private secretary of Tolkien, was in the audience. After the lecture, she asked him for the script, for Tolkien to read. Tolkien wrote a [[Letter to Tom Shippey|letter]] to Shippey on [[13 April|April 13]], [[1970]], with what first seemed like a formal reply.<ref name=\"Preface\"/>\n\nThe first meeting between Shippey and Tolkien took place in [[1972]]. [[Norman Davis]], successor of Tolkien at the Merton Chair of English Language, invited Shippey over for dinner. Shippey, then a Fellow of [[Oxford University|St. John's College]], taught Old and Middle English with Tolkien's syllabus, and his meeting with Tolkien at the dinner left him full of professional piety.<ref name=\"Preface\"/>\n\nAfter Tolkien's death, Shippey's admiration only grew. His first printed essay, \"Creation from Philology in ''The Lord of the Rings''\", was much of an elaboration of his 1970 lecture. In 1979, he was elected to the Chair of English Language and Medieval English Literature at the [[Leeds University|University of Leeds]], a former position of Tolkien. He published his first book, the famed ''[[The Road to Middle-earth]]'', in [[1982]]. At this time, Shippey shifted from the view of Tolkien as a philologist to a view of a post-war writer, or what he called \"traumatised authors\", like [[wikipedia:Kurt Vonnegut|Vonnegut]] and [[wikipedia:William Golding|Golding]].<ref name=\"Preface\"/>\n\nAfter 14 years at Leeds, Shippey moved to the [[wikipedia:Saint Louis University|Saint Louis University]], where he was elected to the Walter J. Ong Chair of Humanities. Here, he could focus in teaching, research and publishing, rather than administrative work. He currently still holds this chair.<ref name=\"hanley\"/>\n\n===Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings===\nBeing considered the foremost expert on Tolkien, Shippey appeared in several documentaries surrounding [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]. He also assisted the dialect coaches<ref name=\"white\"/> and is personally thanked in the closing credits.<ref name=\"imdb\">[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0794142/ Tom Shippey] at [http://www.imdb.com/ IMDb]</ref> He later recollected his experiences: \n{{quote|The funny thing about interviews is you never know which bits they're going to pick. It always feels as if they sit you down, shine bright lights in your eyes, and ask you questions till you say something really silly, and that's the bit they choose. At least they didn't waterboard me. But it was good fun, and I'd cheerfully do it again.|Tom Shippey<ref>[http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/press/885-Tom_Shippey_chat_session.php Transcript of chat session with Pr. Tom Shippey during The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun Online Release Party (09.05.09)] at [[Pieter Collier|TolkienLibrary]]</ref>}}\n\n===Amazon's Rings of Power===\nHe worked as a Tolkien scholar for the Amazon's [[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]] series in the beginning of it's production, but he parted his ways with the project in [[2020]] for undisclosed reasons.<ref>{{webcite|author=Collier Jennings|articleurl=https://www.cbr.com/report-tom-shippey-out-at-amazon-lord-of-the-rings/|articlename=REPORT: Amazon's Lord of the Rings Parts Ways With Tolkien Scholar Tom Shippey|dated=16 April 2020|website=cbr.com|accessed=31 October 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Parallels==\nMany commenters have noticed many parallels between his life and Tolkien's:\n* Both Shippey and Tolkien were born in a colony.\n* Both Shippey and Tolkien moved to [[Birmingham]] at a young age.\n* Both Shippey and Tolkien pursued an academic career in [[Oxford]] and [[Leeds]].\n\n==Bibliography==\nThe list below is extensive, but not complete.\n===Books===\n* [[1982]]: ''[[The Road to Middle-earth]]'', First edition\n** [[1992]]: Second edition\n** [[2003]]: Third edition\n* [[2001]]: ''[[J.R.R.
