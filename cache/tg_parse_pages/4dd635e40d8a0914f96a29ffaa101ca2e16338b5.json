After nearly six hundred years, Entulessë was the first Númenórean vessel to make the journey back to [[Middle-earth]] across the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]]. \n\nAccording to the histories of Númenor, Vëantur sailed the ship into the harbour of the [[Grey Havens]] in the spring of {{SA|600}}. [[Gil-galad]] was still King in [[Lindon]] at that time, and Vëantur remained in his land for some months. As the following year turned to autumn, Entulessë set sail once again, beginning the long journey home to Númenor.<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nIts name means in [[Quenya]] 'The Return', referring to its famous voyage eastward to [[Middle-earth]].
