As evening drew on Thorin's party could hear elven-harps and sweet music wafting up from the valley.  In response and to lighten Thorin's mood, the dwarves took harps and other instruments from [[Smaug]]'s hoard and sang this song.  The song did please Thorin and made him merry but [[Bilbo Baggins]] grew depressed at the warlike tone of the poem.<ref>{{H|Gathering}}</ref>\n\n==Text==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nUnder the Mountain dark and tall\nThe King has come unto his hall!\nHis foe is dead, the Worm of Dread,\nAnd ever so his foes shall fall.\n\nThe sword is sharp, the spear is long,\nThe arrow swift, the Gate is strong;\nThe heart is bold that looks on gold;\nThe dwarves no more shall suffer wrong.\n\nThe dwarves of yore made mighty spells,\nWhile hammers fell like ringing bells\nIn places deep, where dark things sleep,\nIn hollow halls beneath the fells.\n\nOn silver necklaces they strung\nThe light of stars, on crowns they hung\nThe dragon-fire, from twisted wire\nThe melody of harps they wrung.\n\nThe mountain throne once more is freed!\nO! wandering folk, the summons heed!\nCome haste! Come haste! across the waste!\nThe king of friend and kin has need.\n\nNow call we over mountains cold,\n'Come back unto the caverns old'!\nHere at the Gates the king awaits,\nHis hands are rich with gems and gold.\n\nThe king is come unto his hall\nUnder the Mountain dark and tall.\nThe Worm of Dread is slain and dead,\nAnd ever so our foes shall fall!\n</poem>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Poems in The Hobbit]]\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Poems in The Hobbit]]\n[[fi:Kuninkaan tie pois alta mustan Vuoren johti]]"}}}
