Narzug was invented by [[Warner Bros.]] for [[The Hobbit (film series)|''Hobbit'' film series]], where he was portrayed by [[Ben Mitchell]].\n\n== History ==\nWhen the pack had caught up with [[Thorin]] and his [[Thorin and Company|Company]] during their escape from the [[Woodland Realm]], Narzug was ultimately taken prisoner by [[Legolas]] and [[Tauriel]], and they took him with them back to the [[Elvenking's Halls]]. [[Thranduil]], promising to spare his life, interrogated about why the pack had been pursuing the company of [[Dwarves]], and Narzug claimed that his master was in the service of the \"[[Sauron|One]]\"; this caused some alarm to the Elven-king, triggering him to cut off Narzug's head. Legolas complained to his father that he promised otherwise to the captive, with Thranduil dismissing it, saying that he did a favor to the Orc.<ref>''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]''</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Orcs from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Hobbit (film series) characters]]\n\n[[fi:Narzug (elokuvahahmo)]]"}}}
