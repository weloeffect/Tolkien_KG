Tolkien]] sent a letter to [[Stanley Unwin]], reporting that \"The sequel to ''[[The Hobbit]]'' has now progressed as far as the end of the third chapter.  But stories tend to get out of hand, and this has taken an unpremeditated turn.\"<ref>{{L|26}}</ref>  Christopher Tolkien stated that \"The 'unpremeditated turn', beyond any doubt, was the appearance of the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]].\"<ref>{{RS|1I2}}</ref> In \"From Hobbiton to the Woody End\" this crucial moment in the writing of ''The Lord of the Rings'' is revealed.\n \nIn the first draft of this chapter, which continues onward from Version IV in the opening chapter, Bingo Bolger-Baggins (who would later become [[Frodo Baggins]]) and his three nephews – Drogo, Odo, and Frodo – leave [[Hobbiton]] and head out on the [[East Road]] directly for [[Rivendell]], which Bingo has visited before.  Tolkien then dropped Drogo and redirected the hobbits to [[Buckland]] via the road to the [[Woody End]].  On this road Bingo heard a horse coming, the hobbits hid, and a white horse carrying a bundle appeared.  Coming closer, the bundle was actually a small man so cloaked and hooded that only his eyes were visible.  The figure stopped, sniffed, and laughed!  It was [[Gandalf]], wanting a word with Bingo.\n \nAt this point the draft stopped and Christopher believes it was because his father was suddenly struck by the idea that the horseman was ''not'' Gandalf.  Penciled changes in the draft showed the change: The horse's color went from white to black, the man was wrapped in a great black cloak and hood, and his face became entirely shadowed.  Bingo's aimless lark has suddenly become an adventure.\n \nThe chapter continues with a new start, with the title \"Three's Company and Four's More\".  The text reads more like the eventual third chapter of the finished story although the names and personalities of the hobbits will be much altered.  Notable differences include: When the Black Rider draws near, Bingo puts on his [[One Ring|Ring]] to hide and the Rider does not see him.  Nephew Frodo mentions having met a Black Rider months before up in the [[North Moors]] who was asking for Baggins.  When the [[Elves]] appear they sing in the \"secret elf-tongue\" and later Gildor says that Bingo is \"a scholar in the elf-latin\".  When Bingo talks with [[Gildor]] he says that Gandalf told him nothing before he left.<ref>{{RS|Hobbiton}}</ref>\n \nChristopher Tolkien comments that much of the details of what would eventually become \"[[Three is Company]]\" is already in place although countless modifications will be made.  'Bingo' will become 'Frodo'.  'Odo' will become '[[Peregrin Took|Pippin]]', although Christopher says the process was \"strangely tortuous\" (to be described later in the book).  Nephew Frodo disappears but bits of him will resurface in the character of [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]].  Although Gandalf has told Bingo nothing about the Black Riders and the hobbit has no reason to associate them with the Ring, the dark hints of Gildor indicated new ideas occurring to Tolkien as to the future course of his story. Christopher emphasizes that the Riders and the Ring were evolving as his father wrote.  Without the eventual \"The Shadow of the Past\" chapter, Christopher says that these scenes are \"empty\" compared to the final \"Three is Company\", but the details of the scenes will be preserved in the published tale.<ref>{{RS|1IIU}}</ref>\n \n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:From Hobbiton to the Woody End}}"}}}
