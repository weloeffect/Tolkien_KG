In {{TA|2747}} they attacked much of northern [[Eriador]], but were defeated in the [[Battle of Greenfields]].<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref>\n\n==Location==\nThe location of Mount Gram has never been established and the mountain could have been anywhere within the northern [[Eriador]] region.\n\nThe [[Appendix B|Tale of Years]] mentions that in {{TA|2740}} \"Orcs ''renew'' their invasions of Eriador\", obviously referring to [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains|those of the Misty Mountains]], mentioned in the immediate previous entries.<ref>{{App|B2}}</ref> \"The [[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|Goblins]] of Mount Gram\" who invaded the Shire in {{TA|2747|n}} obviously were a subsequent wave of them.\n\nThis must be the reason why [[Robert Foster]] considers Gram to have been one of the Misty Mountains, although he does not cite a specific source or reason to do so.<ref name=Foster/>\n\nOn the other hand, [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] (also without explanation) placed it on a promontory in the [[Ettenmoors]].<ref name=Atlas/>\n\n[[John D. Rateliff]] considers the [[Norse]] name of the mountain (representing [[Northern Mannish]]) and locates it north-eastern of the Shire, suggesting that it refers to the Misty Mountains: \"particularly associated with the goblins throughout the ''Hobbit'', also seem to be the mountains closest to Bilbo's home\". He also considers the possibility that it is another name for Mount [[Gundabad]].<ref>{{HH|End}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn the earliest writings of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', Mount Gram was merely \"Gram Hill\".<ref>{{HH|Pryftan}}, p. 8</ref>\n\n==Etymology and inspiration==\n[[Gram]] in [[Old English]] means \"fierce, grim\" but it is not certain that the name was intended as Old English.\n\nThere is a Mount Gram in Albania.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Mount Gram.jpg|thumb|left|Mount Gram in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''1988: ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien's War in Middle Earth]]'':'''\n:Mount Gram is located North of the [[Ettenmoors]], West of the [[Misty Mountains]], South-west of [[Mount Gundabad]], and just South of the [[Mountains of Angmar]].\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Mount Gram is located in the [[Ettenmoors]], the game's only Player-versus-Player area. At the foot of it sits \"Gramsfoot\", the war-camp of [[Angmar]] which is the only stronghold of the Evil players and cannot be entered by the Free Peoples.\n\n'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''\n:[[Tharzog]] is the chieftain of the [[Orcs]] of Mount Gram.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Citadel tower''</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Evil realms]]\n[[Category:Mountains|Gram]]\n[[de:Gram (Berg)]]\n[[fi:Gramin vuori]]"}}}
