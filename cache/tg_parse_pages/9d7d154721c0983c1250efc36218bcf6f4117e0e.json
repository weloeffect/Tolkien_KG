They represented the majority of the whole Hobbitish population of [[Middle-earth]].\n\n==Culture==\nShire-hobbits called everyone else \"Outsiders\". Due to living in the Shire, the Shire-hobbits were largely sheltered from the rest [[Middle-earth]] and  did not know or pay attention to what was going on outside of the Shire.<ref name=concerning>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref> The thought of the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] far in the west filled them with awe and curiosity and was always part of their imagination (only a very few exceptional hobbits such as [[Isengar Took]] and [[Basso Boffin]] were said to have \"gone to sea\"<ref>{{App|C}}</ref>) but by the end of the Third Age it turned into fear, parallel to distrust of all Elvish lore, and this mood remained even after the [[War of the Ring]].<ref name=concerning/><ref>{{ATB|Foreword}}</ref>\n\nThe Hobbits of the Shire were considered the most rustic and pastoral of their kind. The most important family among the Shire-hobbits were the [[Took Family|Tooks]] of the [[Westfarthing]], who had held the hereditary, and largely honorary, title of [[Thain]] from {{TA|2340}}.\n\nThe Hobbits began keeping records only after the settlement of the Shire. The Shire-hobbits had a general interest in genealogy, and it was the only kind of history they were interested, although others were reading books and gathered news form [[Elves]], [[Dwarves]] and [[Men]].<ref name=concerning>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>\n\n===Hobbit-building===\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - The Hill - Hobbiton-across-the-Water (Colored).jpg|thumb|\"The Hill - Hobbiton-across-the-Water\" by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].]]\nThe Shire-hobbits kept the ancestral custom of [[hobbit-holes]] (probably began by the [[Harfoots]]), which was the case for the poorest hobbits, but also the richer who constructed luxurious versions of the former. \n\nIn the flatlands however, such as in the [[Marish]] they began to build farm-houses and barns, a craft derived from the [[Dúnedain]], or even by the [[Elves]] who roamed [[Eriador]], but in their own hobbit fashion. Craftsmen (millers, smiths, ropers, cartwrights) were building sheds and workshops and preferred living in houses.\n\nThe earliest houses were above-the-ground imitations of ''[[smials]]'': bulged buildings thatched with dry grass or straw, with turfs as roof. The chief peculiarity, that persisted even later, was their preference for round windows and doors. But they evolved the craft, partially with devices learned from [[Dwarves]]. Long, low and comfortable houses, made of wood, brick and stone were built even in the hilly regions where ''smials'' could be burrowed, in important villages ([[Michel Delving]], [[Hobbiton]] and [[Tuckborough]]).<ref name=concerning/>\n\n==Characteristics==\nVery few Hobbits were golden-haired, but at the end of the [[Third Age]], especially in {{SR|1420}}, many children of the Shire were born like this.<ref>{{RK|Havens}}</ref> Several of the daughters of [[Sam Gamgee]] (including [[Elanor Gardner|Elanor]]) were notable examples of golden hair among Hobbits.<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThey were a great following of the brothers [[Marcho]] and [[Blanco]]. They were allowed to pass the [[Brandywine Bridge|Bridge of Stonebows]] and settle the lands, and in return swore nominal allegiance to the [[Kings of Arnor]], being required only to acknowledge their lordship, speed their messengers, and keep the bridges and roads in repair.<ref name=concerning/> \n\nThe hobbits suffered during the [[Great Plague]] but their numbers flourished until the [[Long Winter]] and the [[Days of Dearth]]. But long after them they flourished again.<ref name=concerning/>\n\nThree centuries after their foundation, during the final fight against [[Angmar]] at the [[Battle of Fornost]], the Hobbits maintain that they sent a company of archers to help but this is nowhere else recorded. After the battle the kingdom of Arnor was destroyed, and in absence of the king the Hobbits elected a [[Thain]] of the Shire from among their own chieftains.<ref name=concerning/>\n\nThe first Thain of the Shire was [[Bucca]] of the [[Marish]], who founded the Oldbuck family. However, later on the Oldbuck family crossed the Brandywine River to create the separate land of [[Buckland]] and the family name changed to the familiar \"Brandybuck\". Their patriarch then became Master of Buckland.  With the departure of the [[Oldbucks]]/Brandybucks, a new family was selected to have its chieftains be Thain, the [[Took family]] (Indeed, [[Peregrin Took|Pippin Took]] was son of the Thain and would later become Thain himself). The Thain was in charge of [[Shire-moot]] and Muster and the [[Hobbitry-in-arms]], but as the Hobbits of the Shire led entirely peaceful, uneventful lives the office of Thain was seen as something more of a formality.\n\nThe Hobbits played a significant part in the [[War of the Ring]], after the end of which the greatest families and the learned among them developed a wider interest in ancient history, started writing down many of their oral traditions and studied the ancient histories and legends of the [[Reunited Kingdom]] whose they were a part. By Fo.A. 100 there were many historical books and records formed libraries throughout the Shire. They were very interested in chronology and even drew up complicated tables showing the relations of the [[Shire Calendar]] with other systems, in the [[Red Book]].<ref>{{FR|Records}}</ref><ref>{{App|Shire}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Hobbits]]"}}}
