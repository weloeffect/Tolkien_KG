He wonders aloud where he is and what time it is, and he is answered by [[Gandalf]]. The wizard tells Bingo that it is [[24 October]] and that he is in the house of [[Elrond]].  Bingo recalls his journey and asks what happened at the [[Ford of Bruinen|Ford]] since that part seems dim.  Gandalf says he was beginning to fade and that he would have soon become a wraith.\n \nThey discuss Bingo's wound and Elrond's treatment. Bingo then asks about the others. Gandalf explains that Trotter<ref group=\"note\">The hobbit Trotter would eventually become [[Aragorn]].</ref> and [[Glorfindel]] led the others in making a fire and rushing at the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] with flaming brands. All were destroyed except for two who rode into the wild.  Bingo asks if Elrond made the flood but Gandalf says he did (a reverse of the situation in the finished story).  Gandalf, who in the manuscript was not delayed and came to [[Rivendell]] first, had asked Elrond to send Glorfindel to hunt for the hobbits.  Bingo says he was suspicious of Trotter at first but has grown fond of him and has a feeling that he has seen him somewhere before.  Bingo asks what the Riders did to him on [[Weathertop]]; Gandalf says they were trying to pierce him with the sword of the [[Necromancer]].  Soon after Bingo drops off to sleep.\n \nWhen Bingo awakes he is hungry and goes to search for his friends.  [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] greets him as the [[Lord of the Ring]].  Gandalf hushes him and Odo<ref group=\"note\">Odo Took later becomes [[Peregrin Took]].</ref> says it seems impossible to feel gloomy in Elrond's house.  Soon they are summoned to the evening meal.  Elrond sits with Gandalf, Trotter and Glorfindel are not seen (in the finished story Elrond sits with Gandalf, Glorfindel, and [[Arwen]]) and Bingo finds himself seated next to [[Glóin]].  They agree not to discuss why Bingo has come.  When Bingo asks why Glóin is present the dwarf laughs and winks at him, saying he is no spoil-sport and will not tell yet.  Instead they discuss the fortunes of [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin]], the town of [[Dale]], and the seven dwarves from [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo's]] adventure who are still at [[Erebor]].\n \nAt this point [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] stopped to record a few notes before continuing.  What about [[Balin]] and the other dwarf companions of Bilbo?  Bilbo needs to be seen.  Who is Trotter?  Tolkien then began the chapter anew, but when he reached Gandalf's account of the flood he stopped and started over a third time.  This third manuscript gets very close to the published chapter \"[[Many Meetings]]\", apart from the future change of Trotter into [[Aragorn]] and the introduction of [[Samwise Gamgee]].  The date of Bingo's arrival in Rivendell is altered to [[26 October]] and he has been unconscious for days.  Had the Necromancer's knife-wound not been stopped Bingo would have become a hobbit Ring-wraith and used to strike at Bingo's friends and kin. Gandalf says that the [[Gnomes]], the wisest of the [[Elves]], are the Necromancer's chief foes.  They do not fear the Ring-wraiths because they live half in both worlds but with double power over both.  In the end though, the Wise say that the Necromancer is doomed.\n \nIn this draft when Bingo arises the part about him looking in the mirror and seeing a thinner reflection has been added.  The part about Sam entering the room is not present.  At the feast the final descriptions of Elrond, Gandalf, and Glorfindel are now added (still no mention of Arwen).  In this third draft Tolkien only added a few lines beyond the end of the first draft, with Glóin discussing [[Bard]] the Bowman and his descendants.\n \nA detached sheet has Gandalf telling Bingo that their 'short cut' through the [[Old Forest]] worked out oddly, allowing them to meet [[Tom Bombadil]] and to obtain the one kind of sword the Riders fear. Gandalf wishes he could consult with Bombadil although he thinks he does not approve of the wizard somehow, being of a much older generation.\n \nTolkien recorded a few last notes at this point: Consultation, over the [[Misty Mountains]], down the Great River (the first mention of the [[Anduin]]) to [[Mordor]], Dark Tower, beyond to Fiery Hill. Story of [[Gil-galad]] told by Elrond? Again he asks himself the question: Who is Trotter?\n \nAs for the story of Gil-galad, Christopher reports that a single loose page tells this story but there is nothing to connect it to any other writing.  The story is an abbreviated telling of the Dark Years, the end of [[Beleriand]], the downfall of [[Númenor]], the exiles allying with Gil-galad, and the attack upon Mordor which is part of [[Mirkwood]].  [[Sauron]] (the name appears here) kills [[Elendil]] and Gil-galad but is himself thrown down and his bodily shape destroyed.  There is no mention of [[Isildur]] or [[The One Ring|the Ring]].<ref name=\"Rivendell\">{{RS|Rivendell}}</ref>\n \n==A note on the chronology==\nIn the first draft Gandalf tells Bingo that it is 24 October when he awakes. Christopher notes that this is discrepant with the chronology so far (later this date would be used in the published version, but only after the chronology had been rearranged).  In the manuscript so far the party reached [[Weathertop]] on [[5 October]], crossed the road on [[11 October]], met Glorfindel on [[17 October]], and got to the [[Ford of Bruinen|Ford]] on [[19 October]]. How then can Bingo awake on 24 October if he had been brought in the night before?\n \nThe second and third drafts place the wake-up date on [[26 October]], Bingo was brought to Rivendell on [[23 October]], and lost count for a few days. Other puzzles remain that were not cleaned up at this point.<ref>{{RS|1XIIN}}</ref>\n \n{{references|note}}\n[[Category:The Return of the Shadow chapters]]"}}}
