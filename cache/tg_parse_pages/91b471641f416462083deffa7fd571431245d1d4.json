Biographical information accompany each photograph.\n\nThe book was issued in 1992 to celebrate the Tolkien Centenary.\n\n==From the publisher==\n\nThis biography of Tolkien looks at the family details of the author's life. It tells of his love affair with Edith Bratt, and the dramatic circumstances of their relationship and eventual marriage; of Tolkien's experiences in World War I; of the birth of his children; his academic career, and of the writing of the books that made him a household name all over the world. The book also takes a look at the often strange fan mail that he received, and the honours bestowed upon him before and after his death.\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tolkien Family Album}}\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Publications by title|Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]\n[[Category:Biography books]]\n[[de:The Tolkien Family Album]]"}}}
