Before the island of Númenor was destroyed, its people were taller, wiser, and much more long-lived than other Men. The Downfall and loss of Númenor, the closest mortal land to the blessed realm of [[Aman]], and the living of the Númenoreans in [[Middle-earth]] resulted in a slow withdrawing of the gifts of the Númenoreans. The intermarriage of the house of the [[King of Gondor]] and of other houses of the Dúnedain at first did not speed up the waning of the Dúnedain, it merely continued slowly as it had before.<ref name=\"Waning\" />\n\nBy the time of the [[War of the Ring]], 3,000 years after the Downfall, most of the Dúnedain were on the same level as the Men of Middle-earth. In houses that maintained their purity of Númenórean blood (such as that of [[Aragorn|Aragorn Elessar]]), these changes were somewhat slowed; Aragorn lived 210 years, far longer than any other Man of that time period.{{Fact}}\n\nBroadly speaking, the waning of the Dúnedain could be linked to the decline and ultimate failure of the line of [[King of Gondor|Kings]] in the exilic realm of [[Gondor]], and the dwindling of the royal house in its sister kingdom of [[Arnor]] to a strange, wood-haunting [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]] band. It was also a factor in the gradual depopulation of their lands. In addition to their fall from power and prominence, the Dúnedain suffered mental and spiritual stagnation as well: many of the arts, crafts, knowledge, and technology that the Númenóreans had invented were lost and forgotten. Furthermore, the exiles of Númenor became ignorant and fearful of the [[Elves]], a kindred with which they had been [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|allied]] in their early days.<ref>{{TT|Window}}, pp. 677-9</ref>\n\nThe Dúnedain were very conscious of their waning and it was a source of grief to them, and they did all that they could to prevent it. Some tried to find ways to prolong their lives, while others urged the Númenóreans to maintain genetic and cultural purity. In the middle part of the [[Third Age]], these beliefs led to the violent [[Kin-strife]] when King [[Valacar]] of Gondor married a woman from the tribes of the indigenous [[Northmen]]. After his son [[Eldacar (King of Gondor)|Eldacar]] ascended to the Throne, many people rebelled against his rule because of his mixed blood. This led to a civil war that threatened to destroy Gondor. However, marriage to the Northmen did not seem to hasten the waning of the Dúnedain—but the catastrophic wars in which Gondor (and its sister kingdom [[Arnor]]) were involved certainly did.{{Fact}}\n\nThe [[Appendix A|Annals of the Kings and Rulers of Gondor]] claim that the race of the [[Black Númenóreans]] who lived in the south of Middle-earth quickly \"dwindled or became merged with the Men of Middle-earth\".<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry about King Eärnil I, footnote 1, pp. 1044-5</ref> It is not known if this dwindling referred to their numbers, their life-span, their knowledge, or their skills. It is also not known if the merging of the Black Númenóreans with the Men of Middle-earth was the result of their intermarrying and having children with them, or whether it was an assimilation with the cultures and languages of the Men of Middle-earth so that the Black Númenóreans ceased to appear distinct from them from the point of view of chroniclers from Gondor. It is noteworthy that King [[Tarannon Falastur]] of Gondor married [[Berúthiel]],<ref name=\"Istari\">{{UT|13a}}, note 7, pp. 401-402</ref> a Black Númenórean woman,<ref name=\"Interview\">{{webcite|author=[[Daphne Castell]]|articleurl=https://fantasticmetropolis.com/i/tolkien|articlename=The Realms of Tolkien|dated=|website=[https://fantasticmetropolis.com/i/tolkien ''The Realms of Tolkien'']|accessed=15 January 2021}}</ref> from [[Harad]] whose name was erased from the [[Book of the Kings]]<ref name=\"Istari\"/>.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.zarkanya.net/Tolkien/Decline%20of%20the%20Numenoreans_original.htm Decline of the Lifespan of the Númenóreans] and [http://www.zarkanya.net/Tolkien/Stewards_and_Dol_Amroth.htm The Lifespans of the Ruling Stewards of Gondor and the Lords of Dol Amroth], by Alcuin\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Dúnedain]]\n[[Category:Concepts]]"}}}
