In the outer reaches of the bay was the [[Isle of Balar]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Battle of the Powers]], after the [[Awakening of the Elves]], the shape of [[Middle-earth]] was altered and the chief of the lesser bays between the [[Great Gulf]] and [[Helcaraxë]] was the Bay of Balar.<ref>{{S|Captivity}}</ref>\n\nWhen the hosts of the [[Vanyar]] and the [[Noldor]], led by [[Oromë]], reached the great ocean, [[Ulmo]] caused an island that had stood alone in the middle of the sea to move into the Bay of Balar. The Elves embarked upon the island, which was drawn across the waters to the shores of [[Aman]]. However, the eastern horn of the island separated from the main part and remained in the bay as the [[Isle of Balar]].<ref>{{S|Princes}}</ref>\n\nThe name refers to the [[Valar]] (and Maiar), especially [[Ossë]], who was associated with continental shelf areas. In [[Telerin]] the name [[Valar]] was '''Balai''', and in [[Sindarin]] the form it took was eventually '''Bala'''.\n{{references}}\n{{navigation\n| title=Bay of Balar\n| north-west=[[Cape Balar]], [[Falas]]\n| north=[[Arvernien]], [[Nimbrethil]]\n| north-east=[[Mouths of Sirion]]\n| west=[[Belegaer]]\n| east=[[Taur-im-Duinath]]\n| south-west=[[Isle of Balar]]\n| south=[[Great Gulf]]\n| south-east=Taur-im-Duinath\n|}}\n\n[[Category:Bays]]\n[[Category:Beleriand]]\n[[de:Balar (Bucht)]]\n[[fi:Balarin Lahti]]"}}}
