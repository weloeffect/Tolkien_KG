Tolkien]], fictionally written by [[Bilbo Baggins]]; verses of it are sung at various places in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. This poem was set to music by [[Donald Swann]];<ref>{{RGEO|1}}</ref> the sheet music and an audio recording are part of the song-cycle aptly named ''[[The Road Goes Ever On (book)|The Road Goes Ever On, A Song Cycle]]''. \n\n== ''The Hobbit'' ==\nThe original version of the song is recited by [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] in the last chapter of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', at the end of his journey back to [[the Shire]]. Coming to the top of a rise he sees his home in the distance, and stops and says the following:\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nRoads go ever ever on,\nOver rock and under tree,\nBy caves where never sun has shone,\nBy streams that never find the sea;\nOver snow by winter sown,\nAnd through the merry flowers of June,\nOver grass and over stone,\nAnd under mountains in the moon.\n\nRoads go ever ever on\nUnder cloud and under star,\nYet feet that wandering have gone\nTurn at last to home afar.\nEyes that fire and sword have seen\nAnd horror in the halls of stone\nLook at last on meadows green\nAnd trees and hills they long have known.<ref>{{H|Stage}}</ref>\n</poem>\n\n== ''The Lord of the Rings'' ==\nThere are three versions of this walking song in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - The Road Goes Ever On.mp3|thumb|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] reads The Road Goes Ever On]]\nThe first is sung by [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] when he leaves [[the Shire]] and is setting off to visit [[Rivendell]]:\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nThe Road goes ever on and on,\nDown from the door where it began.\nNow far ahead the Road has gone,\nAnd I must follow, if I can,\nPursuing it with eager feet,\nUntil it joins some larger way\nWhere many paths and errands meet.\nAnd whither then? I cannot say.<ref>{{FR|I1}}</ref>\n</poem>\nThe second version is identical except for changing the word \"eager\" to \"weary\" in the fifth line. It is spoken aloud, slowly, by [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], as he and his companions pause on their way to [[Crickhollow]], looking beyond to lands that some of them have never seen before.<ref>{{FR|I3}}</ref>\n\nThe third version is spoken by Bilbo in Rivendell after the hobbits have returned from their journey. Bilbo is now an old, sleepy hobbit, who murmurs the verse and then falls asleep.\n\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nThe Road goes ever on and on \nOut from the door where it began.\nNow far ahead the Road has gone,\nLet others follow it who can!\nLet them a journey new begin,\nBut I at last with weary feet\nWill turn towards the lighted inn,\nMy evening-rest and sleep to meet.<ref>{{RK|VI6}}</ref>\n</poem>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''1977: [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1977 film)]]:'''\n:Sections of the poem are sung during the trip through [[Mirkwood]].
