These spears were to each consist of \"a thrice-forged head\" with a shaft cunningly lined with [[gold]]. While the spears were forged, the Dwarves never delivered them and Bladorthin never payed for them. As a consequence, the spears remained in Erebor.<ref name=\"inside\" />\n\nIn {{TA|2941}} during the [[Quest of Erebor]], long after Bladorthin had passed away, [[Thorin II|Thorin]] and [[Balin]] pondered on whether or not Bladorthin's order was still intact.<ref name=\"inside\" />\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[John D. Rateliff]], noting that [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] never explained the meaning of ''Bladorthin'', identifies the name as \"clearly [[Gnomish]] (or perhaps [[Noldorin]])\". The Gnomish element ''blador'' \"probably applies to wide open country\" (cf. [[Bladorinand]], an early name of [[Beleriand]]), whereas the element ''-thin'' likely has the meaning of \"grey\" (as in ''[[Thingol#Etymology|'''Thin'''gol]]''). This would give the translation \"the Grey Country\", \"Grey Plains Fay\", or \"Grey Master of the Plains\".<ref name=\"HH\">{{HM|HHO}}, pp. 52-3, 62-3</ref>\n\nLike Rateliff, [[Andreas Möhn]] also identified the name as Gnomish, however, he claimed that ''blador'' meant \"wide earth, flat earth\" and interpreted the whole name as \"wide earth-grey\" or \"Grey One of the wide lands\". He also speculated that the [[Quenya]] form of ''Bladorthin'' may have been '''''Palursindo'''''.<ref name=\"Möhn\">{{webcite|author=[[Andreas Möhn]]|articleurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130107014744/http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Bladorthin.html|articlename=The mysterious king Bladorthin and his political identity in the Third Age|dated=|website=Lalaith|accessed=30 July 2008}}</ref>\n\nUnlike them, [[Michael Martinez|Michael L. Martinez]] did not believe that ''Bladorthin'' was Gnomish, noting not only that the element ''-blad'' only appeared in ''Bladorion'', a name which Tolkien abandoned, but also that the element is similar in sound to \"Blaed(a)\", an [[Old English]] name for \"renowned\".<ref name=\"endorion\">[[Michael Martinez|Michael L. Martinez]], ''[[Parma Endorion|Parma Endorion: Essays on Middle-earth]]'', Chapter 7: \"Things You Might Not Have Known About The Northmen\", \"The Great King Bladorthin\", pp. 78-9</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nIn the early drafts of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', Bladorthin was the name of [[Gandalf]] (who would later be assigned the colour \"grey\" in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'') for much of the narrative until Tolkien decided to change it late in the writing process. A connection can still be seen with the element ''-thin'' with the probable meaning \"grey\" (see [[#Etymology|above]]).<ref name=\"HH\" />\n\n== Portrayal in adaptations ==\n'''2003: ''[[The Hobbit (2003 video game)]]'':'''\n:Bladorthin's spears are some of the items that [[Bilbo Baggins]] must find in Erebor during a quest in the \"Inside Information\" chapter.\n\n== Speculation ==\n*[[Robert Foster]] suggests Bladorthin was an Elven king whose premature death prevented the trade. The speculation that his death was premature narrows down the time of his death between {{TA|1999}} (the establishment of the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]]) and {{TA|2770}} (its destruction by [[Smaug]]).<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry \"Bladorthin\"</ref>\n*[[J.E.A. Tyler]] also interprets his death as premature.{{Fact}}\n*[[Michael Martinez|Michael L. Martinez]] also interprets his death as premature, and suggests that he was a [[King of Dale]], perhaps an ancestor of [[Girion]].<ref name=\"endorion\" />\n*[[Douglas A. Anderson]] in ''[[The Annotated Hobbit]]'' suggests he was a [[Gift of Ilúvatar|mortal]] [[Men|Man]].<ref>{{HM|AH}}</ref>\n*An article on the [[Tolkienwiki]] suggests not only that his death was premature but that his kingdom was destroyed by [[Sauron]], presumably located near the [[Sea of Rhûn]].<ref>{{webcite|author=The Tolkien Wiki Community|articleurl=http://www.thetolkienwiki.org/wiki.cgi?FAQ/Who__was__King__Bladorthin|articlename=FAQ: Who was King Bladorthin?|dated=24 August 2003|website=[http://www.thetolkienwiki.org/wiki.cgi Tolkienwiki]|accessed=29 June 2012}}</ref>\n*[[Andreas Moehn]] counters most of the common theories, notably the interpretation that his death was premature. As ''The Hobbit'' does not mention his death as such, most probable is that Smaug's [[Sack of Erebor|descent]] on the [[Lonely Mountain]] in {{TA|2770}} was what prevented the trade. Therefore he must died sometime later. He also rejects the theory that his kingdom was related to Dale, and locates it in [[Dorwinion]]. In addition, he also suggests that Bladorthin may have been related to the Kings Thorin mentioned who used to send for the smiths of Erebor, rewarding \"even the least skillful most richly\"<ref name=\"unexpected\">{{H|Party}}</ref>.<ref name=\"Möhn\" />\n\n== External links ==\n*{{webcite|author=[[Andreas Möhn]]|articleurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130107014744/http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Fr_Men.html|articlename=The History of the Men of Darkness in Rhún and Harad|dated=|website=Lalaith|accessed=17 October 2012}}\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Characters of unknown race]]\n[[Category:Enigmas]]\n[[Category:Rulers in Middle-earth]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n\n[[de:Bladorthin]]\n[[fi:Bladorthin]]"}}}
