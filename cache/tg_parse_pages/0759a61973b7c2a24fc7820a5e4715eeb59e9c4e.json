Tolkien also explains that his \"''library and papers were piled up like flood-damage''\" during many weeks. He is glad, though, for the additional illustrations she has sent him in three envelopes, found when unpacking (his publisher, [[Rayner Unwin]], had not been in England, and had therefore not been able to display these to Tolkien). However, Tolkien says that \"''the prospect of an illustrated edition [was] not promising''\", but that \"''I like the pictures — certainly some of them — enough to make you a private offer of purchase''\", and asks Fairburn to suggest a price. \n*'''Description:''' The Oxford address in the printed letterhead, and above it his new address and telephone number.\n*'''Publication:''' [[The Times Literary Supplement 14 September 2012|''The Times Literary Supplement'' 14 September 2012]].\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Letter to Mary Fairburn (May 1968)]]\n*[[Letter to Mary Fairburn (10 October 1968)]]\n*[[Letter to Mary Fairburn (4 November 1968)]]\n\n{{References}}\n{{title}}\n[[Category:Letters|Fairburn, Mary (1968-09-04)]]"}}}
