The main gate of Goblin-town was located near the easier pass. Because the [[Orcs]] of Goblin-town had often caught travellers who spent the night near the main gate at the easier pass, travellers stopped using this pass and used the High Pass instead.

Only after the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]], which nearly wiped out all of the Orcs of the mountains, did it become safe again. Nevertheless, in {{TA|2940}}, the goblins of [[Goblin-town]] had burrowed their way back to it, and [[Bilbo Baggins]] and the Dwarves of [[Thorin]] were captured there the next year during the [[Quest of Erebor]].<ref name=\"Hill\" />\n\nDuring the [[War of the Ring]], [[Grimbeorn|Grimbeorn the Old]] and the [[Beornings]] kept the High Pass open,<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}, p. 228</ref> but the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] ignored the High Pass because the eastern side of the Misty Mountains had become too dangerous.\n\n==Other names==\nThe High Pass was also known as the '''''Pass of Imladris'''''.<ref name=\"Index\"/>\n\nIn [[Sindarin]],<ref name=\"Eldamo\">{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-1075852477.html|articlename=S.
