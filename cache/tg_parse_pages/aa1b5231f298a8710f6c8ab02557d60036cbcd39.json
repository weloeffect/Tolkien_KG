This CD is Part II of two albums that constitute the rock musical '''RingLord''' – a rock opera or rock musical inspired by [[The Lord of the Rings]]. The songs themselves contain no references to any [[Middle-earth]] characters such as [[Galadriel]] or [[Boromir]], nor place-names like [[Rohan]] or [[Gondor]]. As the project consisted of 25 songs in total, the band decided to divide the tracks into two separate ''[[The Lord of the Rings|TLOTR]]''-inspired album releases. ''Winds of Change'' (RingLord Part II) was released in 2010 whereas [[Shadow Rising]] (RingLord Part I) had been released six years prior by [[Soundestiny]] in 2004. The time lag was the result of live concerts, music video filming and recording of two other CDs during the intervening period.\n\n==Lineup==\n*Darryl Grant Potter: vocals, guitar, keyboards, flute\n*Kim Sewell: drums, percussion, vocals\n*Elissa Maclean: vocals\n\n==Guests==\n*Clyde Schipke: guitar on 7, 9, 11 and 12\n*Julia Lefik: vocals\n\n==Production==\n*Producers: Kim Sewell and Darryl Grant Potter\n*Engineer: Kim Sewell\n*Arranger: Darryl Grant Potter\n*Artwork: Lester Cannon\n\n==Track listing==\n1.
