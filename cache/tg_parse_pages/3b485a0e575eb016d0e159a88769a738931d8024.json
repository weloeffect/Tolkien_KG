He was notable for attacking [[Morgoth|Melko]] and [[Ungoliant|Gwerlum]] when they were attempting to destroy the [[Two Trees]]. After he had cut off one of Gwerlum's legs, she threw a web around him and Melko killed him. He then took his blade, which was laced with the black, poisonous blood of Gwerlum, and proceeded to destroy the other tree, [[Silpion]].<ref>{{LT1|VI}}, p. 169</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nThe character that was to become Daurin was originally called [[Fëanor]], but this was abandoned. Then his name was changed to '''Daurlas''', a kinsman of Fëanor, and finally to '''Daurin (Tórin)'''<ref>{{LT1|VI}}: \"Notes and Commentary\", p. 172</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Gnomes]]\n[[Category:Gnomish names]]"}}}
