However, she was also akin to the [[Solosimpi]], and had long ago seen the [[Bay of Eldamar|Bay of Faëry]].<ref name=\"Ing\">{{LT1|V}}, p. 129</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[March of Liberation]] and the war with [[Melko]], [[Ingil]] son of Inwë, her grandfather, led the remaining Elves and [[Gnomes]] to [[Tol Eressëa]], where they built the city of [[Koromas]], later known as ''Kortirion'' due to the [[Tirin na Gilweth|great tower]] that Ingil built.<ref>{{LT1|I}}, p. 16</ref> Later, Ingil returned to [[Valinor]],<ref name=\"Ing\"/> and eventually Meril became the Lady of the Isle.\n\nAt some point after the March of Liberation, when the [[Olórë Mallë]] was blocked and the children of [[Men]] could no longer visit Valinor in their sleep, one [[Eärendel|man]] nonetheless managed to find his way to the West and sought the Elves' help, to which Meril responded by asking [[Lindo]], an Elf of Tol Eressëa, to devise a plan.\n\nAfterwards, Lindo and his wife [[Vairë (wife of Lindo)|Vairë]] built the [[Cottage of Lost Play]] in Kortirion, from which the remaining children of Men that stayed with the Elves went to the [[Great Lands]] and comforted the Mannish children living there.<ref>{{LT1|I}}, pp. 19-20</ref>\n\n=== Arrival of Eriol ===\nAround the [[wikipedia:5th century|5th century AD]], [[Eriol]], a Mannish mariner, arrived to Tol Eressëa. After visiting many places on the island, including the Cottage of Lost Play, [[Littleheart]] son of [[Voronwë]] brought him to Meril's house, where Eriol requested to taste ''[[limpë]]'', a magic Elven drink, seeking kinship and fellowship with the Elves.\n\nMeril denied, telling him that it is dangerous for a [[mortal]] [[Man]] to do so, as [[Ilúvatar]] made his [[Children of Ilúvatar|Children]] different, and drinking ''limpë'' would erase his old desires but awake new ones; she also warned him that he would one day long for his lands again.<ref name=\"Mer\">{{LT1|IV}}, pp. 96-7</ref> To explain better she told him the stories of ''[[the Chaining of Melko]]''<ref>{{LT1|IV}}, p. 98</ref> and ''[[the Coming of the Elves and the Making of Kôr]]''.<ref>{{LT1|V}}, p. 113</ref>\n\nSome time after, Meril visited the Cottage of Lost Play during a festival, before Eriol went to [[Tavrobel]], where Littleheart told the tale of ''[[the Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|the Fall of Gondolin]]''.<ref>{{LT2|III}}, pp. 144-5</ref>\n\n=== The Faring Forth ===\nAccording to one outline for the continuation of the ''Lost Tales'', the disastrous [[Faring Forth]], the great expedition to the Great Lands for the rescue of the [[Ilkorindi|Lost Elves]], was instigated prematurely by Eriol himself against Meril's command, who, longing for his home, returned to the Great Lands and \"preached\" of the Faring Forth. Thus, due to Eriol's impatience and recklessness, the Faring Forth was doomed to fail.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''14''', p. 294</ref>\n\nNothing else is known about Meril, or her fate after the Faring Forth.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''Meril-i-Turinqi'' is [[Qenya]] for \"Queen of Flowers\", being a combination of ''[[meril]]'' (\"flowers\") + ''[[i]]'' (\"the\") + ''[[turinqi]]'' (\"queen\").<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-112046301.html|articlename=ᴱQ.
