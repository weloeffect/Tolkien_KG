The Age ended some years later with the departure of the [[White Ship]] from the [[Grey Havens]].<ref name=AB/><ref name=rings/>\n\n===[[Fourth Age]]===\nThe Fourth Age was a time when the Elves faded while Men, [[Hobbits]], and, for a time, Dwarves prospered and recovered after the defeat of Sauron, until the [[Dominion of Men]].<ref name=AB/>\n\n===[[Later Ages|Further future]]===\n{{quote|For not we but those who come after will make the legends of our time.|[[Aragorn]]<ref>{{TT|Riders}}</ref>}}\nTolkien said in a letter written in [[1958]] that he imagined that the events of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' had happened approximately 6000 years earlier, so it was about the end of the Fifth Age if the length of the Ages had remained unchanged, but they had probably quickened and it was about the end of the Sixth Age or in the Seventh. However, he did not explain the criteria of why the Ages should be shortened.<ref name=\"Letter211\">{{L|211}}: \"''I imagine the gap ''[between the Fall of Barad-dûr and our Days]'' to be about 6000 years: that is we are now at the end of the Fifth Age, if the Ages were of about the same length as S.A. and T.A.  But they have, I think, quickened; and I imagine we are actually at the end of the Sixth Age, or in the Seventh.''\"</ref>\n\nTwo years after that letter, Tolkien changed this idea and wrote that, instead, we were already in the year 1960 of the Seventh Age, indicating that this Age follows the Christian reckoning.<ref>{{NM|P1vi}}, p. 39</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn earlier texts, such as ''[[The Later Annals of Valinor]]'', J.R.R. Tolkien referred to the 'First Age(s) of the World' rather than the 'First Age of the Children of Ilúvatar'. This variation had much earlier starting point, extending the First Age back to the creation of Arda, but consistently ended with Morgoth's defeat in Beleriand.<ref>{{LR|AV}}, p. 118</ref>\n\nThe terms 'First Age of the Sun' and 'Ages of the Sun' are commonly used by many fans, but do not appear anywhere in Tolkien's writings. The 'First Age of the Sun' in this conception is held to begin with the first rising of the Sun and continue until Morgoth's defeat nearly 600 years later. While this is at odds with Tolkien's statements that the first age was the longest by far it is a common misapprehension because the subsequent ages all took place entirely during the [[Years of the Sun]].\n\n==See also==\n*Ages of the [[Chaining of Melkor]]\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Ages|02]]\n[[Category:Chronology]]\n[[Category:Periods]]\n[[de:Zeitalter]]"}}}
