In an oval lawn upon the summit of the hill, on the eastern side, was placed a low mound which in time became covered with [[Alfirin]]. Before the mound was a black stone with the letters [[lambe]], [[ando]], and lambe engraved upon it.\n\nIts location was a secret kept for many centuries among the Kings of Gondor and the [[Stewards of Gondor|Stewards]]. At Isildur's command, the hill would be a hallow and none would disturb it other than a heir of Elendil. Aside from visiting the tomb from time to time for wisdom in dark days or in days of distress, the Kings of Gondor would bring their fully grown heirs to the tomb, where they would tell them of the making of the tomb, and of matters of which they should know. After the Death of [[Eärnur]], presumably by the [[Witch King]], The [[Ruling Stewards]], now given the full authority and power of the King, would be allowed to visit the tomb, though they seldom did. [[Cirion]] would bring [[Eorl the Young]] to the tomb of Elendil, where they would swore the [[Oath of Eorl]] and Oath of Cirion respectively. This forged the Alliance between [[Gondor]] and the new formed [[Rohan]].\n\nAfter this, Cirion determined that the Tradition of Isildur was now made futile, and the Hallow was now no longer at the \"midpoint\" of Gondor. Also Gondor was no longer the same kingdom as when Isildur spoke. The Tomb of Elendil was removed to [[Minas Tirith|Minas Anor]], where it would still dwell for the Rest of the [[Third Age]].\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Books and documents within the legendarium]]"}}}
