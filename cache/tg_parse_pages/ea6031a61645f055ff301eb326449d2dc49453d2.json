Tolkien and His Literary Resonances''''' is a collection of scholarly articles about [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and his works.\n\n==From the publisher==\n{{blockquote|Although [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s literary works have, over the past few decades, attracted a considerable and varied body of criticism, much of this material is inaccessible, unreflective, and repetitive. Though various scholars have treated Tolkien's sources and his concept of fantasy, this study situates the author in a broad literary context that includes ancient metrical modes, medieval culture, Renaissance poetics, 19th-century social movements, and modern critical thought. Each chapter is written by an expert contributor and examines the literary resonances of Tolkien's works from a variety of informed perspectives.}}\n\n==Table of Contents==\n*C.W.
