Here, Lynnette Porter examines what we mean when we talk about heroes, and for the first time illustrates the heroic qualities that can be found in the less-celebrated characters in the Lord of the Rings books and movies. She takes a critical look at the importance of literary and cinematic heroes in general, emphasizing how [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], [[Galadriel]], [[Éowyn|Eowyn]], [[Arwen]], [[Legolas]], and [[Gimli]] display essential characteristics of true heroes and ultimately showing that our attraction to and celebration of heroes does not have to be limited to the \"leading man\". Bringing together a discussion of both the books and the movies, Porter redirects the spotlight on these overlooked, yet much-beloved characters to illustrate the shift in the way the Western movie-going public identifies and glorifies heroes and shows how the roles they play, and the behaviors they display are worthy of our praise and admiration.}}\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Film books]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]"}}}
