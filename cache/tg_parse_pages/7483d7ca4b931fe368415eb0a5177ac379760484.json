The Ruffians had foolishly walked into a trap within a banked portion of the road, which the Hobbits secured with barricades at either end. In the ensuing fight nearly seventy of the [[Men]] died. The victorious Hobbits loaded the bodies of their foes into wagons and hauled them to an old, nearby sand-pit for burial, which thereafter was called the Battle Pit. Nineteen Hobbits also died in the fray but they were buried separately, with honor in a hill-side grave above the Battle Pit. Sometime later, \"a great stone was\" placed over the hill-side grave and a garden grew around it.<ref name=\"scouring\" />\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nIn an early draft of the chapter \"[[The Scouring of the Shire]]\", the burial place of the Ruffians was originally \"an old gravel-pit\" that the Hobbits later named the '''Battle Pits'''.
