Of the outlaws, only Barahir's son [[Beren]] survived, as he was not present during the attack.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - At Tarn Aeluin.jpg|thumb|left|''At Tarn Aeluin'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nAfter the [[Dagor Bragollach]], Barahir and his people refused to flee [[Dorthonion]], and continued to defend the land. [[Morgoth]] sought to destroy them, and their numbers dwindled severely. Soon nearly all of the people of Barahir had been slain or fled, and only [[Bëorings|twelve men]] remained with Barahir: his son [[Beren]], his nephews [[Baragund]] and [[Belegund]], and nine faithful servants of his house, [[Radhruin]], [[Dairuin]], [[Dagnir]], [[Ragnor]], [[Gildor (outlaw)|Gildor]], [[Gorlim]], [[Arthad]], [[Urthel]], [[Hathaldir]].<ref>{{S|18}}</ref>\n \nMorgoth continued to pursue Barahir and his companions, and coming to the wild lands around [[Tarn Aeluin]], Barahir and his men took refuge there. Unable to discover their whereabouts, Morgoth ordered [[Sauron]] to find and destroy the outlaws.<ref name=Beren>{{S|19}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Prelude===\nGorlim the Unhappy, who was among the outlaws of Barahir, had been wedded to [[Eilinel]]. Returning from the war, however, he had found their house empty and his wife gone. Clinging to hope that she was not dead, he would occasionally return in secret to their house. On one such trip, he thought he caught a glimpse of her through the window. But before he could go to her, the light was blown out, and he was captured by Sauron’s hunters. Sauron promised Gorlim that he would be reunited with his wife if he revealed the hiding place of Barahir. When Gorlim at last gave in and told all that Sauron wished, Sauron mocked him and revealed his trickery. For Eilinel was dead, and Gorlim had only seen a [[phantom]] of her designed to trick him. Sauron then slew Gorlim, thus reuniting him with his wife.<ref name=Beren />\n \nBeren, who had been sent away on an errand to spy on the Enemy, dreamt one night of carrion [[crows]], sitting in the trees beside a mere with blood on their beaks. In that same dream, Gorlim came to him as a [[wraith]], telling Beren of his treachery and warning him of Barahir’s danger. Beren awoke, and set off at once, but he would arrive too late.<ref name=Beren />\n\n===The Ambush===\nHaving learned where Barahir and his men were hiding, Morgoth sent Orcs to destroy them. The orcs arrived at the outlaw's lair before dawn. They ambushed the men, who were not expecting an attack, and slew them all. The captain of the orcs cut off the hand of Barahir, which still bore the [[Ring of Barahir|ring]] that [[Finrod Felagund]] had given him.<ref name=Beren />\n\n===Aftermath===\nBeren arrived at the lair of the outlaws to find his companions dead, and his dream in part true: carrion-birds sat in the trees beside the lake, croaking in mockery. Beren buried his father and raised a cairn over him, upon which he swore an oath of vengeance. He then set out in pursuit of the orcs who had slain his companions. He discovered their camp at [[Rivil's Well]], where the captain of the Orcs was holding up Barahir’s hand and boasting. Beren leapt out from his hiding place, and slaying the captain took the hand of Barahir with the ring and fled. For several years afterwards, Beren wandered through Dorthonion as a lone outlaw, accomplishing deeds of great daring and evading capture.<ref name=Beren />\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Conflicts of the First Age]]"}}}
