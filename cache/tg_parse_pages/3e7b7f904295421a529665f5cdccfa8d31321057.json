The faces, rotting and twisted, with weed caught in their hair, appeared in dark waters being lit by pale and fell lights, as from unseen candles.<ref>{{TT|Marshes}}, p. 627</ref>\n\n[[Gollum]] told [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Sam Gamgee|Sam]] that there was a [[Battle of Dagorlad|great battle]] long ago in which Men, Elves and Orcs fought for months at the [[Black Gate]]s and that the marshes had expanded since the battle and had swallowed up the graves of the warriors who fell in the battle. How the dead warriors came to be transformed into such [[undead]] beings is unknown. Sam said that the Dead cannot be really there, because the battle was an age ago and asked if the presence of dead Men, Elves and Orcs in the marshes was some \"devilry hatched in the Dark Land\", likely referring to [[Sauron]]'s dark arts in the nearby [[Mordor]].<ref>{{TT|Marshes}}, p. 628</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nA ''corpse candle'' is defined as a \"luminous appearance, resembling the flame of a candle, sometimes seen in churchyards and other damp places, superstitiously regarded as portending death\".<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Corpse+candle|articlename=Corpse candle (in ''Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary'', published 1913 by C. & G.
