It was the home of [[Farmer Maggot]],<ref>{{AB|Boating}}</ref> who (like the other [[Hobbits]] in this inhospitable area) lived above ground rather than in a traditional [[Hobbit-holes|Hobbit-hole]]. Farmer Maggot's farm was well-known in the area for his mushrooms, which he protected fiercely against trespassers with his three fearsome [[dogs]].\n\nThe center of the farm consisted of a large farm house made of brick with thatched roof and associated farm-buildings.  They were all enclosed within a high wall with a wooden gate to the outside [[Maggot's Lane]]. The lane led out of the farm and, after one to two miles, crossed a deep dike and climbed onto the high bank of the causeway between [[Rushey]] and [[Stock]]; five miles north was the [[Bucklebury Ferry]].\n\n==History==\nWhen [[Frodo Baggins]] was young and lived at [[Brandy Hall]], he occasionally sneaked onto the farm to poach some mushrooms.  On the last visit, Maggot had caught Frodo and gave him a beating for his thievery. Frodo avoided the place and him ever after.\n\nOn [[25 September]] {{TA|3018}}, Frodo, [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] came to Bamfurlong in the afternoon. There they met Farmer Maggot and learned that earlier a [[Nazgûl|Black Rider]] had visited the farm and enquired about Baggins. The travelling hobbits gratefully accepted a hearty supper before the farmer drove them to [[Bucklebury Ferry]] in his wagon.<ref>{{FR|Mushrooms}}, p. 91</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Bamfurlong'' is probably a combination of \"bean\" and \"[[Wiktionary:furlong|furlong]]\" (a division of a common field). It is the name for a land that is usually used to plant beans.<ref>{{HM|N}}, entry '''Bamfurlong''', p. 765</ref>\n\n[[David Salo]] suggests that the name ''Bamfurlong'' represents [[Old English]] ''Beanfurlang'', \"a [[Wikipedia:furlong|furlong]] of beans\" or simply \"bean-field\".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=https://tolkienlistsearch.herokuapp.com/message/5e9c35b63ee6a6c41e9862d6|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names (1.21)|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]|accessed=2022-09-23}}</ref>\n\n''[[Wikipedia:Bamfurlong|Bamfurlong]]'' is a real-life English place-name.<ref>{{AB|Intro}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn the first edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Farmer Maggot's land did not have a name. The name Bamfurlong first appeared as the name of Farmer Maggot's land in [[1962]] in the poem ''[[Bombadil Goes Boating]]'' and was inserted in the [[1967]] second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 113</ref> In the first edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Bamfurlong was the name of a place from which one of the special runners came with a \"secret message\" in the chapter \"[[The Scouring of the Shire]]\". In the second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'', this place was called [[Whitfurrows]] instead of Bamfurlong.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 657</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Bamfurlong.jpg|thumb|250px|Bamfurlong in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Bamfurlong is a prominent landmark in the [[Marish]].\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:The Shire]]\n[[de:Langfurch]]\n[[fi:Papuvainio]]"}}}
