It lay in what remained of Beleriand, between the mountains of [[Ered Luin]] and the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]]. From its [[Grey Havens]] Elven ships sailed daily to [[Aman|the West]]. Imladris, or [[Rivendell]], was founded by [[Elrond]] about halfway through the Age.\n\nIn the early part of the Second Age many [[Noldorin]] Elves journeyed East of the Ered Luin and established the realm of [[Eregion]] near the [[Misty Mountains]]. These Elves, led by [[Celebrimbor]] son of [[Curufin]], became close friends with the [[Dwarves]] of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]]. Together they made great endeavours in smithcraft, until the skill of the Elves reached a height never to be matched again. This attracted the attention of [[Sauron]], who tricked the Elves into making the [[Rings of Power]] by his aid. When the Elves perceived that he desired to rule them with [[the One Ring]], they resisted, and Sauron waged war against them. In this war, Eregion was destroyed and Celebrimbor killed.\n\n== Mannish realms ==\nThe Second Age was the age of the glory of Númenor, the great island kingdom that was created for the descendants of the [[Edain]] in the first years of the Age, and as the years passed, their power grew until it surpassed that of any nation of [[Men]], before or since. They sailed east, exploring Middle-earth and founding great cities there. Eventually, their power and pride became so great that they challenged the [[Valar]] themselves, and were destroyed.\n\nMeanwhile, in [[Middle-earth]] there were [[Dark Years]], in which Men lived in simple tribal societies or were under the domination of Sauron. The men who served Sauron revered him as a god and feared him greatly. In the beginning of the Second Age, the [[Dúnedain]] attempted to help the Men of Middle-earth, but eventually desired to dominate them.\n\nThe Downfall of Númenor was not the end of the Second Age; a remnant of the [[Númenóreans]] led by [[Elendil]] escaped its wreck and founded kingdoms in Middle-earth: [[Arnor]] in the north and [[Gondor]] in the south. Along with [[Gil-galad]], they formed a mighty alliance, the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]], and marched on [[Sauron]], who had grown great again, assailing the Dark Tower of [[Barad-dûr]]. With the first overthrow of Sauron by the Alliance, the Second Age came to its end.\n\n== Major events of the Second Age ==\n{| rules=\"all\" style=\"border:1px solid darkgrey; border-collapse:collapse\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"\n!\n! style=\"text-align:center\" |Military<ref group=note>Only wars and isolated battles are mentioned as events; for battles being part of larger campaigns, look the campaigns' respective articles or [[Index:Conflicts#Second Age]].</ref>\n! style=\"text-align:center\" |Political\n! style=\"text-align:center\" |Other\n|-\n!|1st millennium \n|\n|\n*Foundation of [[Lindon]] ([[Second Age 1|1]])\n*Foundation of [[Númenor]] ([[Second Age 32|32]])\n*[[Dwarves]] from [[Blue Mountains]] migrate to [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] ([[Second Age 40|c. 40]])\n*[[Númenóreans]] establish contact with [[Middle-earth]] ([[Second Age 600|600]])\n*[[Lords of Andúnië]] title is created ([[Second Age 630|630]])\n*[[Eregion]] is founded ([[Second Age 750|750]])\n*[[Hirilondë]] is built ([[Second Age 877|877]])\n|\n*[[Sauron]] returns from the [[East]] ([[Second Age 500|c. 500]])\n*Sauron constructs [[Barad-dur]] ([[Second Age 1000|1000]])\n|-\n!|2nd millennium\n|\n*[[War of the Elves and Sauron]] ([[Second Age 1693|1693]]-[[Second Age 1700|1700]])\n|\n*Númenóreans establish permanent havens in Middle-earth ([[Second Age 1200|1200]])\n*[[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]] come to [[Laurelindórenan]] ([[Second Age 1350|1350]])\n*[[Elrond]] founds [[Rivendell]] ([[Second Age 1697|1697]])\n*First [[shadow]] falls on Númenor ([[Second Age 1800|1800]])\n|\n*The [[Rings of Power]] are constructed ([[Second Age 1500|1500]])\n*The [[Three Rings]] are constructed ([[Second Age 1590|1590]])\n*The [[One Ring]] is forged ([[Second Age 1600|1600]])\n|-\n!|3rd millennium\n|\n|\n*[[Haven of Umbar|Umbar]] is fortified ([[Second Age 2280|2280]])\n*[[Pelargir]] is built ([[Second Age 2350|2350]])\n|\n*First appearance of the [[Nazgûl]] ([[Second Age 2251|2251]])\n|-\n!|4th millennium\n|\n*[[Ar-Pharazôn]] lands at the [[Haven of Umbar]] but Sauron surrenders without resistance ([[Second Age 3261|3261]])\n*The [[Great Armament]] assails [[Valinor]] ([[Second Age 3319|3319]])\n*[[War of the Last Alliance]] ([[Second Age 3429|3429]]-[[Second Age 3441|3441]])\n|\n*[[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]] founded ([[Second Age 3320|3320]])\n*[[Last Alliance]] ([[Second Age 3430|3430]])\n|\n*[[Downfall of Númenor]] and Changing of the World ([[Second Age 3319|3319]])\n*Defeat of Sauron and end of the Age ([[Second Age 3441|3441]])\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Timeline/Second Age|Timeline of the Second Age]]\n*[[Dark Years]]\n*[[Middle Days]]\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.tor.com/2022/08/22/a-second-age-primer-the-rings-of-power-the-rise-and-fall-of-numenor-and-the-last-alliance/ A Second Age Primer: The Rings of Power, the Rise and Fall of Númenor, and the Last Alliance] at [https://www.tor.com Tor.com]\n\n{{references|notes}}\n[[Category:Ages|2]]\n[[Category:Second Age| ]]\n[[de:Das Zweite Zeitalter]]\n[[fr:/encyclo/chronologie/second_age]]\n[[fi:Toinen Aika]]"}}}
