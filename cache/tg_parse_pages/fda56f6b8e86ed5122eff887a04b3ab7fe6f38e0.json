'''''axani''''') is a [[Quenya]] noun meaning \"law, rule, commandment, primarily proceeding from [[Ilúvatar|Eru]]\". The term refers to laws established by Ilúvatar that lesser beings are directed to follow but can choose to disobey. The ''axani'' contrast with the ''[[únat]]i'', which are physical laws that are impossible to break. [[Melkor]] refused to accept any ''axani'' as binding upon him, but much to his frustration, he was unable to violate the ''únati''.<ref>{{NM|P2ix}}, pp. 205-218</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nIt is said to derive from [[Valarin]] ''[[akašân]]'', meaning \"He says\", with \"He\" referring to Eru.<ref>{{WJ|AD1}}, p. 399</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\n''axan'' is similar to the ancient Greek word ''[[Wikipedia:Anax (Greek)|ἄναξ]]'' (''anax'') meaning \"ruler, lord, king\". The Valarin form ''akašân'', in the meantime, resembles the word [[Wikipedia:akasha|akasha]], the aether in Hindu cosmology and mysticism. It is not known whether Tolkien was familiar with either term.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Axantur]]\n*[[ambarmenie]]\n{{references}}\n{{title|lowercase}}\n[[Category:Concepts]]\n[[Category:Oaths and prophecies]]\n[[Category:Quenya nouns]]\n[[Category:Metaphysics]]"}}}
