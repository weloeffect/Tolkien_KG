[[The Fellowship (band)|The Fellowship]] take a musicological approach to imagine how the ancient cultures described by J.R.R. Tolkien might have sounded, performing on an all-acoustic array of ancient and modern instruments that includes harp, lute, hurdy-gurdy, krumhorn and gong among a wide variety of others. \n\nThe subject matter for the songs on ''In Elven Lands'' are drawn from aspects of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[legendarium]], including stories from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. The album title, ''In Elven Lands'', is taken from the lyrics of their song 'Beware The Wolf': \n\n''...let us ride before the break of day, through woven woods in Elven lands, to find the starry-jeweled hand...'' \n\n==Track Listing of the First Edition==\n# Tîr Im\n# Dan Barliman's Jig\n# Silver Bowl\n# Man in the Moon\n# Verse to Elbereth Gilthoníel\n# Eléchoi\n# Beware the Wolf\n# Oromë: Lord of the Hunt\n# Creation Hymn\n# When Dûrin Woke\n# Eala Earendel\n# Sacred Stones\n# Battle of Evermore\n# Blood of Kings\n# Verses to Elbereth Gilthoníel\n# Evening Star\n\n==Second Edition==\n[[File:In Elven Lands (Second Edition) cover art.jpg|thumb|right|''In Elven Lands'' (Second Edition) cover]]\nOn [[5 November]] [[2012]] a digitally remastered Second Edition of the album was released by Oglio Records. The Second Edition corrects some [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]] lyrics, and includes a performance of Tolkien's original version of [[Namárië]] as well as ''Silmesse'', a song with Elvish lyrics by Tolkien linguist [[Helge Kåre Fauskanger]]. In all, it includes five previously unreleased songs and two alternate versions of works from the first release.\n\nLegally downloaded versions of the '''''In Elven Lands Second Edition''''' also include fully illustrated a 50-Page booklet in PDF form, with lyrics and album notes.\n\n# Tîr Im\n# The Longbottom Leaf\n# The Silver Bowl\n# The Man in the Moon\n# A Verse to Elbereth Gilthóniel\n# Elo Elleth\n# Beware the Wolf\n# Oromë: Lord of the Hunt\n# Creation Hymn\n# [[Silmesse]]\n# Elechoi Mirnu Aglaron\n# When Dûrin Woke\n# Eala Earendel\n# Namárië\n# The Battle of Evermore\n# The Blood of Kings\n# Canticle to Elbereth Gilthóniel\n# The Evening Star\n# Terra Beata\n\n==Languages==\nThe songs on the First Edition of ''In Elven Lands'' are written in Modern English, [[Anglo-Saxon]], and a kind of [[Neo-Elvish]] consisting of intentionally corrupted versions of Proto-[[Quenya]] (the so-called \"Elf-Latin\") and [[Noldorin]]/[[Sindarin]].\n\nThe Second Edition also introduces [[Helge Kåre Fauskanger]]'s [[Neo-Elvish|Neo-Quenya]] in the song ''[[Silmesse]]''. With the departure of guest artist Jon Anderson from the Second Edition, two of the songs in Modern English have been removed, leaving only three songs in Modern English, as opposed to eight in [[Elvish]] dialects.\n\nAccording to the album notes in the Second Edition, the language usage was intended to create the impression of a corrupt later text, such as Tolkien described in the Introduction and Appendices to ''The Lord of the Rings''. In order to create the illusion of a corrupt text (or in this case, a series of corrupt texts), the authors used Proto-Quenya and Proto-Sindarin vocabulary taken from ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' (Volumes [[The Book of Lost Tales Part One|1]] and [[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two|2]]) and ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''. They then intentionally mutated words to account for the shifting palate, used loan-words from other languages from Arda, and in one case simply mangled the pronunciation and re-transcribed the results to show the effects of the \"folk music process\" that often occurs over time.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://inelvenlands.com Official website]\n* [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFZlPP8DCnw YouTube video for the Second Edition]\n* [http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_ldIVHy1WDna4dAUt_K4DnzugaNIEluABA YouTube list of the official videos]\n* [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0-K_EcCdEs YouTube video for Silmesse]\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Albums]]\n[[Category:Early music]]"}}}
