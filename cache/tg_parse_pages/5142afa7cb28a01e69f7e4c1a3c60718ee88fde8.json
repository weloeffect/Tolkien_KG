Around [[September]] {{TA|3001}}, as [[Bilbo Baggins]] was leaving the Shire for Rivendell, Gildor met the [[hobbit]] as he waved them farewell in one of their camps above [[Woodhall]]. The following years he met him once more,<ref>{{FR|Three}}, p. 83</ref> perhaps at Rivendell.\n===Meeting Frodo===\n{{quote|Elves seldom give unguarded advice, for advice is a dangerous gift, even from the wise to the wise, and all courses may run ill.|Gildor Inglorion}}\nIn September {{TA|3018}}, he led a Wandering Company of [[Elves]] of [[Rivendell]] travelling eastwards from the [[Emyn Beraid]], where they went to see [[Varda|Elbereth]] in the ''[[Elostirion-stone|palantír]]'' that was kept there. On the [[24 September|24th]], they were [[Elven Hymn to Elbereth|singing]], and unknown to him their sounds drove away a [[Black Riders|Black Rider]] who was searching for [[Frodo Baggins]], [[Samwise Gamgee]] and [[Peregrin Took]] on the road near the [[Woody End]]. As they passed by them, Gildor was the hindmost, and seeing Frodo he greeted him, to his surprise. Gildor initially intended that the elves bid the [[hobbits]] farewell and continue on their way, until Pippin spoke of the Black Riders pursuing them. Upon hearing this, he invited the hobbits to join them, although it was not their custom. He rejoiced after hearing Frodo's [[Elen síla lúmenn' omentielvo|Quenya greeting]] and gave him the title [[Elf-friends|Elf-friend]].<ref name=\"3IC\">{{FR|Three}}, pp. 80-5</ref>\n\nAt night they camped on a hill above [[Woodhall]]; they ate and sang, and Gildor discussed the peril that haunted the three hobbits. He sensed Frodo's fears and uncertainties about his travel to Rivendell, and was worried hearing that [[Gandalf]] had not returned as he had promised to Frodo. When Frodo asked whether he ought to wait for Gandalf, Gildor replied that the choice was Frodo's, but if he demanded counsel, then Gildor advised him not to wait but to follow Gandalf's plans, with trusty companions. However, he refused to tell him more of the nature of the mysterious Black Riders, except that they were agents of the [[Sauron|Enemy]], and deadly.<ref name=\"3IC\"/>\n\nAfter separating from the hobbits, he informed other [[Wandering Companies]] to be on the watch,<ref name=\"3IC\"/> and sent word to the house of [[Tom Bombadil]], probably before the [[26 September|26th]].<ref>{{FR|Bombadil}}, p. 132</ref> He also spoke with [[Aragorn]]<ref>{{FR|Strider}}, p. 172</ref> and sent a message to [[Elrond]].<ref>{{FR|Flight}}, p. 210</ref>\n\nTwo years later, on [[22 September]] {{TA|3021}}, he met the hobbits once again. He accompanied a riding of great Lords and Ladies, that planned to sail [[Aman|West]] on board the [[White Ship]]<ref>{{RK|Havens}}, p. 1028</ref> and probably he was among the Elves who sailed to the West.<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry \"Gildor Inglorion\"</ref><ref group=note>The narrative does not specify whether Gildor also boarded the ship to the West or if he was simply present as a companion.</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe meaning of ''Gildor'' is not given, but it can be deduced as [[Sindarin]] \"Star Lord\", from [[gil]] (\"star\") and -dor (\"lord, king\").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-879448255.html|articlename=S. ''Gildor'' m.|dated=|website=Eldamo|accessed=15 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe same applies to ''Inglorion'', which means \"Son of Inglor\", from ''[[-ion]]'' (\"son of\"),<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-4136402505.html|articlename=S. ''Inglorion'' m.|dated=|website=Eldamo|accessed=23 August 2024}}</ref> leading to the genealogical discussion explained below.\n\n==Ancestry==\nGildor is one of the less prominently featured Elves, yet he seems important enough to raise questions concerning his lineage, or the identity of this character. Gildor calls himself \"Gildor Inglorion of the House of Finrod\". He also says: \"''We are [[Exile of the Noldor|Exiles]], and most of our kindred have long departed and we too are only tarrying here a while, ere we return over the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]].''\"<ref name=\"3IC\"/> \n \nIt should be noted that Tolkien initially used names from his (unpublished) ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' writings rather at random in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and the first drafts of the sequel which would become ''The Lord of the Rings'': other examples are the mention of [[Gondolin]] and the appearance of [[Elrond]] in ''The Hobbit'', which were only later brought into alignment with ''The Lord of the Rings'' and the unpublished mythology by a third edition of the book.<ref name=\"L257\">{{L|257}}</ref> This may be the case of the reference to the name \"Finrod\".\n\nThe name \"Gildor\" first appeared in the outlines of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' in February [[1938]],<ref>{{RS|Hobbiton}} (p. 45)</ref> and in Tolkien's notes of that time, \"Finrod\" still meant the character later known as [[Finarfin]]<ref name=\"RC3IC\">{{HM|RC}}, \"[[Three is Company]]\", pp. 103-4</ref> and [[Finrod|his son]] had the older name \"[[Inglor]]\".\n\nHowever the name ''[[Inglor]]'' reappeared, in [[Quenya]] form, for Finarfin (who in the earlier legendarium, was named Finrod). Finarfin's [[Amilessë|mother-name]] was ''[[Ingalaurë]]''.<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, note 30</ref> If Ingalaurë is to be translated in [[Sindarin]] according to the [[Sindarization|sound-changing rules]], this would become ''Inglor''. Thus, the connection of Gildor to the house of Finrod/Finarfin still remains in the updated legendarium.\n\nThis all suggests that, while Gildor might have been initially intended to be Felagund's son, in the final version he may have been a member of the House of Finrod as some other descendant, or servant, not one of Finrod's sons — perhaps one of the knights of [[Nargothrond]].\n\nIt is also possible that he was a son of a supposed \"Inglor\" — a character unconnected to Finrod Felagund.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Gildor in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game - Gildor Inglorion, of the House of Finrod.jpg|Gildor Inglorion in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Gildor.JPG|Gildor Inglorion in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n\n'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''\n:[[Legolas]], here an Elf of Rivendell, tells Strider that Elrond had received news of the burden, but it is left unexplained how.\n\n'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''\n:Adapter [[Brian Sibley]] wanted to use as much of the original Elvish lines as possible.
