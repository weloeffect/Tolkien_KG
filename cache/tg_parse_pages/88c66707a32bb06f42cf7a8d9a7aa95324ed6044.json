Records in Gondor mention \"peoples of Khand\"<ref name=Northmen>{{UT|Northmen}}</ref> and  it is known that the land of ''Khand'' was inhabited by ''Variags''.<ref>{{HM|UI}}, entry ''Khand'', p. 566</ref> \n\nIn the [[Third Age]] the eastern [[Wainriders]] had been spreading southward beyond Mordor and were in conflict with their neighbours further south, the peoples of Khand. Later [[Sauron]] arranged a peace and an alliance between the Wainriders and the peoples of Khand and prepared an attack on Gondor, that should be made at the same time from the north and from the south. In {{TA|1944}} the Wainriders and the \"men of Khand\" mustered a great army on the southern shores of the [[Sea of Rhûn]] and moved as fast as they could along the northern side of the [[Ered Lithui]] and defeated the northern army of Gondor in a [[Disaster of the Morannon|battle]] north of the [[Morannon]]<ref name=Northmen/> and killed King [[Ondoher]] and both his sons, [[Artamir]] and [[Faramir (son of Ondoher)|Faramir]].<ref name=Wainriders>{{App|Gondor}}, paragraph about the attack of the Wainriders and the death of King Ondoher in T.A. 1944, p. 1049</ref> Afterwards they pursued the withdrawing survivors of the northern army of Gondor into the north of [[Ithilien]], defeated the reargurad of the northern army of Gondor and killed the new commander of the northern army of Gondor, [[Minohtar]], the son of the sister of King Ondoher.<ref name=Northmen/> They believed that they had defeated Gondor, set up a camp and feasted and revelled, but Eärnil, the Captain of the Southern Army, who had destroyed the army of Harad that had crossed the Poros moved north with the Southern Army as quickly as possible, gathered the retreating Northern Army of Gondor, defeated the Wainriders in the [[Battle of the Camp]] and drove the surviving enemies into the [[Dead Marshes]] where a great part of them perished.<ref name=Wainriders/><ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1944, p. 1086</ref>\n\nDuring the [[War of the Ring]] the Variags fought at the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]<ref name=Battle>{{RK|Battle}}, p. 846</ref> on [[15 March]] {{TA|3019}}.<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019, March 15, p. 1093</ref> They were held in reserve in [[Osgiliath]] along with armies of [[Easterlings]] and [[Southrons]]. After the death of the [[Witch-king]] they were sent onto the battlefield by [[Gothmog (Lieutenant of Morgul)|Gothmog]]. Their ranks were among [[troll-men]] and [[Orcs]] when the knights of [[Dol Amroth]] ran and drove them back.<ref name=Battle/>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe meaning of the name ''Variags'' is unknown. J.R.R. Tolkien wrote in his [[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings|instructions]] for translations of ''The Lord of the Rings'' into other languages that all names that were not inlcuded in a list in those instructions should not be translated. In contrast to the entry for ''Corsairs'' in this list where his instruction was to translate the name, the ''Variags'' were not included in this list.<ref>{{HM|N}}, pp. 750-82</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nA draft version of what would later become appendix F mentions that the name ''Variag'' is a word from \"the speech of Men of the East and allies of Sauron\".<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, carbon copy of typescript F4, p. 79.</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nIn the Rus' chronicle of Nestor the name ''Variags'' is used for the people, which are usually named ''Varangians'' and which were Scandinavian rovers that overran parts of Rus' and reached Constantinople in the 9th and 10th centuries. A group of ''Varangians'' formed the Varangian Guard of the Byzantine Emperor.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 566</ref>\n\n[[Wikipedia:Variag|Variag]] is a Slavic word derived from [[Norse]] ''Varingar'' \"mercenary people\" (''vár'' \"contract\"). The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varangian_Guard Varangian Guard] were Norse body-guards of the Byzantine Emperor.\n\nIt has been suggested that Tolkien adopted the Slavic term to indicate that the Variags were possibly mercenaries serving a possible Lord of Khand.<ref>{{HM|IE}}, Obscure Languages</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:Angus McBride - Variags.jpg|thumb|''Variags of Khand'' in [[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game|MECCG]]]]\n'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''\n:Variags, who speak the tongue Varadja, share ties with both Easterlings and Haradrim.<ref>{{ICE|2000}}</ref><ref>{{ICE|8003}}</ref>\n\n'''1995-8: ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]'':'''\n:Variags of Khand is a Man Faction.\n\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Variags.jpg|thumb|left|A group of Variags in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n\n'''2016: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Variags are first encountered as enemies in [[Anórien|Far Anórien]], guarding the road to [[Minas Tirith]] against the passage of [[Rohirrim]]. Another group of Variags is found in North [[Ithilien]] after the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], attempting to retreat home into [[Khand]]. Unlike the [[Easterlings]] and the [[Haradrim]], the Variags are mercenaries, following [[Sauron]] not out of fear or worship but because of the riches promised to them. As such, they hold no real hatred against the Men of the West and at several points players have the option to simply pay them to defuse an armed situation.\n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Images of Variags|Images of Variags]]\n\n==External links==\n*[https://tolkien-studies.xenite.org/blog/who-were-the-variags-of-khand/ Who Were the Variags of Khand?]\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Men]]\n[[Category:Mannish words]]\n[[Category:Servants of Sauron]]\n[[de:Variags]]\n[[fr:encyclo/peuples/hommes/variags]]\n[[fi:Varjaagit]]"}}}
