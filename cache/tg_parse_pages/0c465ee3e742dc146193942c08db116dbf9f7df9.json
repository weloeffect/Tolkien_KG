It could reaching over ten feet high, with thick, hollow, dark-brown stalks. The reed, cut properly, served as a compress for muscular injuries when heated.<ref name=\"p86\">{{ICE|2026}}, p. 86</ref>\n\n:'''''Balák''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''Asgnaith'', [[Quenya|Q.]] ''Axonehta''), also known as ''Boneboom'', was a blue-crowned reed found in the Elornan shores of the Far South. The stalk was brewed in medicinal tea to treat broken bones.<ref>{{ICE|2010}}, p. 170</ref><ref>{{ICE|2026}}, pp. 87-88</ref>\n\n:'''''Dogmallow''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''Glorfind'', [[Quenya|Q.]] ''Laurefindë''), also known as ''Wood Tallow'', was a large reed that grew in wetlands. The lowest third of the stem was coated in golden hairs, while the upper third was solid. Scaping out the center and boiling it produced a substance that slowed poisons, though patients risked mistaking it for an actual antidote.<ref>{{ICE|2026}}, pp. 99-100</ref>\n\n:'''''Lartha''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''Nennech'', [[Quenya|Q.]] ''Nendeht''), also known as ''Letha'', ''Licka'', or ''Latha'', was a reed found along cold freshwater banks. Its colour goes from brown at the base, to a light green-grey in the middle, and dark brown at the tip. Dried and powdered, it could be boiled into a mild analgesic, easing pain and colds.<ref>{{ICE|2010}}, p. 178</ref><ref>{{ICE|2026}}, p. 116</ref>\n\n:'''''Mountainrod''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''Orodlisg'', [[Quenya|Q.]] ''Orolixë''), also known as ''Bonebinder'', was a tall reed found near mountain waters. Crushed and boiled for ten minutes into a bitter tea, it hastened the mending of broken bones.<ref>{{ICE|2026}}, pp. 123-124</ref>\n\n:'''''Rolling Reed''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''Nedhrin'', [[Quenya|Q.]] ''Nerrindë''), also known as ''Hoopgrass'', ''Round Reed'' or ''Waterweed'', was a curved wetland reed. Dried and powdered root mixed with water slowed metabolism when consumed and allows the imbiber to hold their breath longer. Its stems were also dried as toys and decorations.<ref>{{ICE|2026}}, p. 131</ref>\n\n:'''''Sheep’s Plume''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''Pethlebed'', [[Quenya|Q.]] ''Quesselepsë''), also known as ''Frillrod'' or ''Ache-ease'', was a tall reed found along freshwater shores. Boiling and straining the frilly top yielded a restorative tea that also cured the disease jadaras.<ref>{{ICE|2026}}, p. 135</ref>\n\n'''2005: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game]]: [[Paths of the Wise: The Guide to Magicians and Loremasters|Paths of the Wise]]'''''\n:Two types of reeds are distinguished:\n\n:'''''Bluereed''''' was a tall reed with a bluish tinge, found along the banks of the [[Entwash]]. The [[Rohirrim]] valued it for sustaining scouts and messengers, as it staved off the need for sleep for a full day, though it had no effect on Elves.<ref>{{Decipher|Wise}}, p. 84</ref>\n\n:'''''Spirit Fire''''' was a tall reed gathered along the shores of the [[Long Lake]], which had strong invigorating effects. Valued across Middle-earth, it was a main trade good of the Men of [[Lake-town]], though the orcs also used it for foul concoctions.<ref>{{Decipher|Wise}}, p. 87</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Plants]]"}}}
