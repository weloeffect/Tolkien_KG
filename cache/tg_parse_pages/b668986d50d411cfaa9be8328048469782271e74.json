Thráin founded the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] at [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], and was a descendant of [[Durin|Durin the Deathless]] via his grandfather [[Durin VI]].<ref name=\"AppA\">{{App|A3}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Thrain II Discovers the Lonely Mountain.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Thrain Discovers the Lonely Mountain'']]\nThráin's grandfather, Durin VI, was [[King of Khazad-dûm]] when the [[Balrogs|Balrog]] of [[Morgoth]] appeared in [[Moria]]; this Balrog has forever been known as [[Durin's Bane]] as Durin was killed by it in {{TA|1980}}. Durin's son - and Thráin's father - [[Náin I]] was then King until he was himself killed in {{TA|1981|n}} and the Dwarves left Moria.<ref name=\"AppA\"/><ref name=ta>{{App|TA}}</ref>\n\nThráin - at the tender age of 47 - became King of [[Durin's Folk]]. He led his wandering people until {{TA|1999}} when he founded the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] in [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]],<ref name=ta/> whilst some settled instead in the [[Grey Mountains]]. In Erebor the [[Dwarves]] began building a mighty kingdom, discovering the prized possession of King Thráin: the [[Arkenstone]], the Heart of the Mountain.<ref name=\"AppA\"/>\n\nThráin died in {{TA|2190}} at the age of 256 and was succeeded by his son [[Thorin I]]. With a rule of 209 years, Thráin I was the longest-ruling of all the known [[Kings of Durin's Folk]] with, perhaps, the only exception being [[Durin|Durin the Deathless]].\n\n==Etymology==\n''Þráinn'' is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''.

The phrase on [[Thrór's Map]] \"''Here of old was Thrain - [[King under the Mountain]]''\"<ref>{{H|Thror}}</ref> causes some fans to claim that Tolkien wrote it for Thráin I, since [[Thráin|Thráin II]] was never a King under the Mountain.\n\n[[Christopher Tolkien]], [[John Rateliff]] and [[Douglas Anderson]] say that Tolkien accidentally reversed the family tree Thrór --> Thráin --> Thorin to Thráin --> Thrór --> Thorin and then reverted it before final publication of the book.  Rateliff argues in his book that the original tree was favoured but that it is impossible to say which was intended to be the correct genealogy.  According to Rateliff, the first edition uses the name \"Thráin\" in two distinct contexts that support either point of view and that Tolkien only added a third element to the story (the forenote) in 1947 when he sent suggested changes to the publisher.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Thráin I.jpg|thumb|175px|Thráin I in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2020: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Thráin I appears in several flashbacks. In the year [[Third Age 1981|T.A. 1981]] he is shown leading the survivors evacuating from [[Khazad-dûm]] as his father makes a doomed final stand to cover their retreat. In the story narrating the history of [[Fram]] and [[Scatha]], Thráin I is the King who received the necklace of Scatha's teeth after laying claim to the [[dragon]]'s treasure, becoming greatly enraged at Fram's affront.\n\n{{references}}\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n| race=dwarf\n| house=[[House of Durin]]\n| born={{TA|1934}}\n| died={{TA|2190}}\n}}\n{{seq\n| prev=[[Náin I]]\n| list=[[Kings of Durin's Folk|King of Durin's Folk]]\n| dates={{TA|1981}} - {{TA|2190|n}}\n| next=[[Thorin I]]\n| nrow=2\n}}\n{{seq\n| pvac=None\n| prev=Position created\n| list=1st [[Kings under the Mountain|King under the Mountain]]\n| dates={{TA|1999}} - {{TA|2190|n}}\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n\n{{durinskings}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thrain I}}\n[[Category:Dwarves]]\n[[Category:Dwarven names]]\n[[Category:Kings of Durin's Folk]]\n[[Category:Kings under the Mountain]]\n[[Category:Longbeards]]\n[[Category:Norse names]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[de:Thráin I.]]\n[[fi:Thráin I]]\n[[fr:/encyclo/personnages/nains/3a/thrain_ier]]"}}}
