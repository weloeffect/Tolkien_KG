The friendship of Bëor and Baran with the Eldar led to the creation of the [[House of Bëor|First House]] of the [[Edain]], which produced some of the greatest heroes of the First Age.\n\nBalan was called ''Bëor'' by the [[Elves of Nargothrond]], which meant \"vassal\" in [[Taliska]], the language of the people of Bëor. When Bëor finally died at the age of 93 willingly, a very old age for men at that time, he was given the epithet ''the Old''.<ref name=\"West\"/>\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | BEO | | | |BEO='''BËOR'''<br/><small>''{{FA|262|n}} - {{FA|355|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | |,|-|-|^|-|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree | | | BAR | | | | BEL |BAR=[[Baran]]<br/><small>''{{FA|289|n}} - {{FA|380|n}}''</small>|BEL=[[Belen]]<br/><small>''b. {{FA|292|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree | |,|-|^|-|.| | | |!| |}}\n{{familytree | BOR | | BNR | | BEL |BOR=[[Boron]]<br/><small>''{{FA|315|n}} - {{FA|408|n}}''</small>|BNR=[[Baranor (son of Baran)|Baranor]]<br/><small>''b. {{FA|317|n}}''</small>|BEL=[[Beldir]]<br/><small>''b. {{FA|316|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree | |:| | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | |:| | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | BER | | | | | | | | |BER=[[Beren]]<br/><small>''{{FA|432|n}} - {{FA|503|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n[[File:J.R.R.
