Use of the road virtually ended after the [[Great Plague]] and the [[Long Winter]] when Tharbad was abandoned and its bridge ruined, and the Old South Road to [[Dunland]] was mostly lost. The patch of the road around [[Bree-land]] became overgrown with grass because of disuse and so was called the Greenway.<ref>{{FR|Sign}}</ref><ref>{{FR|South}}</ref><ref name=utindex>{{UT|Index}}</ref>\n\n[[Boromir]] took this road, crossing Tharbad but losing his horse, on his way to [[Rivendell]]. It is possible that the road was restored after the end of the [[War of the Ring]].\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Greenway.jpg|thumb|250px|Greenway in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:\"Greenway\" specifically refers to the portion of the road running through the [[Bree-land]], with the rest of it called the \"North-South Road\". Running south from [[Fornost]], the road crosses a large chasm called \"Cirith Núr\" that separates Bree-land from the [[North Downs]] through the wooden \"Trestlespan\" bridge in the town of \"Trestlebridge\". South of [[Andrath]], the Greenway passes through the mannish town of \"Herne\" where is turns east towards [[Tharbad]]. With the [[Bridge of Tharbad]] now broken, the road to the east of Tharbad is considered to be a separate [[Old South Road]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[North-South Road]]\n*[[Great West Road]]\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Arnor]]\n[[Category:Eriador]]\n[[Category:Roads and streets]]\n\n[[de:Grünweg]]\n[[fi:Vihertie]]\n[[fr:encyclo:geographie:routes:chemin vert]]"}}}
