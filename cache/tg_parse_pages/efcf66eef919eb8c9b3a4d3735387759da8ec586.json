However, Orodreth was powerless to stop [[Sauron]] from taking the isle, and fled south. Sauron began breeding large [[wolves]] in the isle, and, by sending evil spirits into the fell beasts, turned them into [[werewolves]].\n\nTen years later during the [[Quest for the Silmaril]], [[Beren|Beren Erchamion]], seeking the [[Silmarils|Silmaril]], enlisted Finrod's aid, but the two of them and their group were captured while passing the isle. Sauron defeated Finrod in a contest of spells and songs, and their companions were slain one-by-one by werewolves. Finrod saved Beren's life by killing the werewolf that came for him, but in doing so, he died himself.\n\n[[Lúthien]] and [[Huan]], [[Hound]] of [[Valinor]], came to Beren's rescue, and Huan killed the wolves sent against him. After [[Draugluin]] was killed, Sauron went out in wolf-form but was defeated. Lúthien gained control over the isle from Sauron, who fled, and, after releasing those who had been captive there under Sauron, she reduced Minas Tirith to ruins. Finrod was buried there by Beren and Lúthien.<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref> The isle remained clean afterwards, but after the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] it was retaken by [[Morgoth]] and its towers rebuilt.<ref>{{GA|Year 472}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Tol-in-Gaurhoth'' is [[Sindarin]] for \"Isle of Werewolves\", from ''[[tol]]'' (\"isle\") + plural ''[[i]]'' (definite article) + ''[[gaur]]'' (\"werewolf\") + ''[[hoth]]'' (\"host\").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entries ''gaur'', ''hoth''</ref> It is also mentioned simply as \"Gaurhoth Isle\".<ref>{{LB|4}}, \"2.
