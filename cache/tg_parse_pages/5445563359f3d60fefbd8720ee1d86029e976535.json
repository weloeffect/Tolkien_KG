It was extended in the latter edition.\n{{title}}\n==Synopsis==\n[[Gandalf]], [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], [[Gimli]], and [[Éomer]] are gathered in the [[Hall of the Kings|throne-room]] of [[Minas Tirith]] after the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. \n\nDebating their next steps, Gandalf worries that Frodo has passed beyond his sight and that he has sent the hobbit to his death. He says that [[Sauron]] is re-marshalling his troops in [[Mordor]]. Gimli questions why they should care; in response, Gandalf tells him that \"10,000 orcs now stand between Frodo and [[Mount Doom]]\". Aragorn puts forward the idea of drawing them away from the [[Plateau of Gorgoroth|plains of Gorgoroth]] to give Frodo a chance to get the [[The One Ring|Ring]] to Mount Doom. \"A diversion,\" Legolas calls it. Gandalf warns that Sauron will suspect a trap, however Aragorn assures the wizard that the bait will be taken.\n==Differences==\nIn the books, [[Imrahil]], [[Elladan]], and [[Elrohir]] are also present while Legolas and Gimli are not. Gandalf is the one who suggests that the [[Host of the West]] be created while others have doubts. The [[Last Debate]] takes place outside of [[Minas Tirith]].<ref>{{RK|Debate}}</ref>\n{{References}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King scenes|59]]"}}}
