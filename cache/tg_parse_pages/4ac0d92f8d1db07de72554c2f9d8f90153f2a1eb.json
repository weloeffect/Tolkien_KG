Fëanor held the idea of syllabic analysis of the words by the Sarati, and made also use of signs (tehtar) for vowels (instead of the full letters), placed over the preceding tengwar/consonants, indicating their “colour”. A consonant followed by a vowel was concidered as a “full letter” (ñávëa or ñáva-tengwë). The sarat <em style=\"font-style: normal; font-family: 'Tirion Sarati'; font-size: 2em;\">‘</em> was imported from the previous system, and when a vowel had no preceding consonant, it was used as a carrier for convenience in writing. This system however was used by Fëanor mainly for tradition and brevity, favoring the Quanta Sarme instead.\n\nApart of the standard consistent characters, there were also additional tengwar which don't fit in the structure. These are usually modifications of the standard tengwar. Hyarmen is a modification of Charma, Úre is of Wilya, and Anna derived from an earlier sarat.\n\n==== Table ====\nThe following table attempts to display how the sounds of archaic Quenya,<ref>[http://www.uib.no/people/hnohf/qevolution.pdf The Evolution of Primitive Elvish to Quenya]: Valinorean</ref> of Feanor's time would be represented with the earliest known Tengwar.\n\nThe names are known only from the 3rd Age table composed in Gondor so it is not known if this arrangement existed since Fëanor’s days. It is possible that some of the known names may have replaced earlier, unrecorded forms.\n\n{| border=\"1\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | Tincotéma\n! colspan=\"2\" | Tyelpetéma<ref group=\"1\">Quenya also made use of a palatal series, the Tyelpetéma. Christopher Tolkien, who made the names known, notes that the names are given in a number of different formulations, and he cannot determine which were the standard ones. The only difference from the Tincotéma was the underposed (for tengwar with raised stems) and overposed (for tengwar with lowered stems) dots. Those tengwar, not included in the tables, must have been ommited from the standard letters.</ref>\n! colspan=\"2\" | Parmatéma\n! colspan=\"2\" | Calmatéma\n! colspan=\"2\" | Quessetéma\n|-\n| {{tg|mode=smith|1}}\n| t<br>Tinco\n| {{tg|mode=smith|1Ö}}\n| ty<br>Tyelpë\n| {{tg|mode=smith|q}}\n| p<br>Parma\n| {{tg|mode=smith|a}}\n| k<br>Calma\n| {{tg|mode=smith|z}}\n| kw<br>Quessë\n|-\n| {{tg|mode=smith|!}}\n| t<sup>h</sup><br>extended grade<ref group=\"1\">The original Fëanorean alphabet contained a Grade of &ldquo;extended&rdquo; stems, both raised and lowered. The usage of those tengwar (whose names, if they had, are of course unknown) was to represent spirant sounds. As we know, no Amanya language possessed spirant sounds, since the Primitive spirants ''th, ph'', and ''kh'' had already became ''th, f'' and ''ch'' in Quenya. It is possible that they were used for recording Valarin or maybe archaic forms.</ref>\n| {{tg|mode=smith|!Ö}}\n| t<sup>h</sup><br>extended grade\n| {{tg|mode=smith|Q}}\n| p<sup>h</sup><br>extended grade\n| {{tg|mode=smith|A}}\n| k<sup>h</sup><br>extended grade\n| {{tg|mode=smith|Z}}\n| k<sup>h</sup>w<br>extended grade\n|-\n| {{tg|mode=smith|2}}\n| nd<br>Ando\n| {{tg|mode=smith|2Ô}}\n| ndy<br>Indyo\n| {{tg|mode=smith|w}}\n| mb<br>Umbar\n| {{tg|mode=smith|s}}\n| ng<br>Anga\n| {{tg|mode=smith|x}}\n| ngw<br>Ungwë\n|-\n| {{tg|mode=smith|3}}\n| th > s<br>Thúle<ref group=\"1\">In Noldorin Quenya the sound ''th'' had merged with ''s'' since very early.

This quote suggests that Quenya originally contrasted /&#633;/ and /r/, since there would be no need for independent letters if the two sounds were merely [[:wikipedia:allophone|allophones]] of each other. In this case, however, the original distribution of the letters Óre and Rómen must have been different from the one we observe at the end of the Third Age, where both letters are in perfectly complementary distribution, no contrast being possible. If Óre is the original name of this letter, this could mean that it is one of the words with original /&#633;/.</ref>\n| {{tg|mode=smith|6Õ}}\n| ry?<br>?Arya<ref group=\"1\">This tengwa is given as Arya, and is attested either as a Rómen or as an Óre with the overdots. Since the sound ''ry'' derives from original ''sy > zy'' (still present in Vanyarin), the form of the letter should be Áze with the dots, changed after ''z'' merged with ''r''. But then this tengwa should be placed among the Additional Tengwar, for it is not consisted of a telco and a lúva.</ref>\n| {{tg|mode=smith|y}}\n| v<br>Vala\n| {{tg|mode=smith|h}}\n| [[Yogh|ȝ]] > -<br>Anna<ref group=\"1\">Anna originally represented ''[[Yogh|ȝ]]'', a sound from primitive ''g'' (cf. ''*galadâ > *galda > *ȝalda > alda''). The ''ȝ'' sound was early lost, and Anna was used as an initial vowel carrier to indicate an assuming &ldquo;vanished&rdquo; initial consonant wherever words begun with a vowel (note that its \"ancestor\", the sarat <em style=\"font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tirion Sarati'\">'</em>, was also used for ''ȝ'' before being used as a carrier. It was inherited as a carrier by Fëanor, and later it replaced initial Anna). This usage tried to explain the relation of words between Noldorin words starting with a vowel where Telerin had ''g-'' (cf. Quenya ''alda'' vs. Telerin ''galla''), but did not explain all the cases of words without an initial consonant (''alca'', according to this, should be spelled *{{tg|mode=smith|hDjaE}} that time, although it had never been ''**galka'' before). The problem with the name is that Anna is given as derived from the root AN, and not *GAN (although there is some evidence that the latter root is the correct, and therefore its archaic form was ''*ȝanna'').</ref>\n| {{tg|mode=smith|n}}\n| w<br>Wilya\n|-\n!colspan=\"10\" | '''Additional Tengwar:'''\n|-\n| {{tg|mode=smith|7}}\n| r<br>Rómen\n| {{tg|mode=smith|7Õ}}\n| ry<br>?Arya\n| {{tg|mode=smith|u}}\n| rd<br>Arda\n| {{tg|mode=smith|j}}\n| l<br>Lambë\n| {{tg|mode=smith|jÔ}}\n| ly<br>Alya\n|-\n| {{tg|mode=smith|m}}\n| ld<br>Alda\n| {{tg|mode=smith|8}}\n| s<br>Silmë\n| {{tg|mode=smith|I}}\n| s<br>Silmë nuquerna<ref group=\"1\" name=\"nu\">The inverted forms of Silmë and Ázë, which were used when followed by a vowel (since they were too tall to receive a tehta).

If the original form of Arya was an Ázë with dots, there must also have been an inverted form of it (Arya Nuquerna).</ref>\n| {{tg|mode=smith|k}}\n| z > r<br>Ázë > Árë<ref group=\"1\">The /z/ sound later changed to /r/ only in the Noldorin dialect, and this letter took the name Áre.</ref>\n| {{tg|mode=smith|,}}\n| z > r<br>Ázë > Áre nuquerna<ref group=\"1\" name=\"nu\"/>\n|-\n| {{tg|mode=smith|9}}\n| hy<br>Hyarmen\n| {{tg|mode=smith|l}}<ref group=\"1\">Yanta's shape reminds of the Rúmilian letter for ''y''. It might have represented this sound too (Yanta probably written *{{tg|mode=smith|lD4#}}, while this word should read **''ainta'' in 3rd Age spelling). In our attested examples of 3rd Age texts, it occurs only as the -''i'' of dipthongs (in {{tg|mode=smith|lE}}, {{tg|mode=smith|lH}} ''ai'', ''oi'' etc.). Maybe e.g. ''tuilë'' was originally spelled *{{tg|mode=smith|1UlUj$}} (''tuyulë'') like in Rúmilian orthography, before simplified to {{tg|mode=smith|1lUj$}}. Cf.

Since it&rsquo;s attested in diphthongs in our samples like Yanta is, we can suppose it was used for intervocalic ''w'', which later became ''v''. Maybe ''taurë'' was originally spelled *{{tg|mode=smith|1D.D7R}} (''tawarë'') before simplified to {{tg|mode=smith|1.D7R}}, while for initial ''w'', only Wilya was used. Jim Allan suggested that ''úre'' should be written as {{tg|mode=smith|.J7R}}, a function that reminds of the Rúmilian spelling of long ''u''… &ndash; or maybe it was used as ''u'' in Quanta Sarme, like in the Mode of Beleriand? Cf. Yanta.</ref>\n| {{tg|mode=smith|&#189;}}\n| h<ref group=\"1\">'''Halla''' represented an archaic breath ''h'', that survived from primitive H only in Amanye languages, while Charma represented ''ch'', that derived from Primitive KH. The problem is that the ''h'' of the word ''halla'' evolved from the latter sound: KHAL > ''*khallâ > halla'', therefore pronounced ''*challa'' in Fëanor&rsquo;s time.
