After Lúthien escaped and fled Doriath, Daeron became lost in the search for her, and eventually wandered east over the [[Blue Mountains]].\n\nHis role is primarily told within ''[[The Lay of Leithian]]'', which itself is referred to within ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' where Daeron's history is much more briefly given.\n\n==History==\n=== Early history ===\n[[File:Pete Amachree - Daeron at the court of Menegroth.jpg|thumb|right|''Daeron at the court of Menegroth'' by [[Pete Amachree]]]]\nThough Daeron's origins were not recorded, he was known to be in Thingol's service prior to {{YT|1300}}, by which time he had devised his [[Cirth|Runes]], which he would go on to [[Certhas Daeron|greatly better]] with time.<ref name=ga31>{{GA|31}}</ref>\n\nAt some point, after the arrival of the [[Green-elves]] in {{YT|1350}}<ref>{{GA|30}}</ref> Daeron became friends with [[Saeros]], who also was skilled in song.<ref>{{CH|5}}</ref> \n\nIn {{FA|20}}, when [[Fingolfin]], [[King of the Noldor]], held the great [[Mereth Aderthad|Feast of Reuniting]], Daeron came as one of the two messengers of Thingol bringing his greetings.<ref>{{GA|72}}</ref>\n\nDaeron was enamoured of Lúthien, daughter of Thingol and [[Melian]], and all his thought of her was set in the music he made for her song and dance.<ref name=beren>{{S|19}}</ref>\n\n=== The arrival of Beren ===\nOne night, in the mid-summer of {{FA|464}},<ref>{{GA|175}}</ref> Daeron was piping his music and Lúthien came out to dance. Soon though, her feet stilled and she [[Ir Ithil ammen Eruchín|sang a song of such bewildering delight]] that Daeron ceased piping and cast his flute away, heart-broken and wonder bound as stone. As she was singing however, [[Beren]] emerged from the darkness, stumbling as if in doubt or blind. As Lúthien's song ended Daeron, released from its spell, became aware of Beren's presence. Assuming Beren to be an enemy, Daeron fled in dismay, calling for Lúthien to flee and follow him. Lúthien, who had never known fear, initially stood unmoved, but was soon seized by it and vanished.<ref name=\"llc\">{{LB|IV}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Anke Eißmann - Daeron spies on Beren and Lúthien.jpg|thumb|right|''Daeron spies on Beren and Lúthien'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]\nIn the following spring, of {{FA|465}},<ref>{{GA|177}}</ref> Daeron discovered Lúthien's love for Beren when he espied them dancing together. In an act of jealousy, he then cursed a spell of silence on Doriath, causing a hush to come over birds, trees, and even the river [[Esgalduin]]. This was brought to the attention of Thingol, and he sent for Daeron to ask what omen this silence meant; initially, he was even hopeful that it may be a sign of the return of [[Oromë]]. Daeron however disabused him of that hope, stating that another had entered Doriath and chilled the woods by their strange deeds, and that if the king did not see not the cause, the queen might guess, and the maiden doubtless knew. Thingol, angered by this riddle, ordered Daeron to speak plainly on who was in his woods. Daeron, however, looked on Lúthien and faltered, seeing his disgrace and said no more.<ref name=c4>{{LB|C4}}</ref><ref name=\"llc\"/>\n\nLúthien then spoke up and told Thingol of Beren arriving from the north and that she would bring him to Thingol's hall if he promised not to slay him or set him in bonds. Thingol agreed, but after dismissing everyone else spoke in private with Daeron. Thingol wondered what wizardry was brought by this illcomer, and ordered Daeron to secretly watch Lúthien—who he suspected was being ensnared by some trap of Morgoth—and make sure she didn't warn Beren and let him escape. Thingol desired to look upon Beren, and further instructed Daeron to take some archers with him. With heavy heart, Daeron agreed.<ref name=c4 />\n\n<div class=\"floatright\">\n{{blockquote|<poem>\nSilence then fell upon the hall;\nlike graven stone there stood they all,\nsave one who cast her eyes aground,\nand one who laughed with bitter sound.\nDairon the piper leant there pale          \nagainst a pillar. His fingers frail\nthere touched a flute that whispered not;\nhis eyes were dark; his heart was hot.\n‘Death is the guerdon thou hast earned,\nO baseborn mortal, who hast learned          \nin Morgoth’s realm to spy and lurk\nlike Orcs that do his evil work!’\n‘Death!’ echoed Dairon fierce and low,\nbut Lúthien trembling gasped in woe.\n</poem>|Daeron to Beren, \"[[Lay of Leithian Canto IV|The Lay of Leithian]]\"}}</div>\nTrue to her word though, Lúthien led Beren into Thingol's halls and before his throne. When Thingol demanded of Beren why he was there, Beren responded that it was for love, and he desired Lúthien. At this, all went silent except for Daeron, who leaned against a pillar and laughed bitterly. With dark eyes and a hot heart, he called for Beren's death, and further insulted him by declaring him a baseborn mortal who learned in Morgoth's realm how to spy and lurk like [[Orc]]s.<ref name=c4 />\n\nThingol, bound by his oath to Lúthien, did not outright slay Beren, but sought for it indirectly with his impossible demand of a [[Silmaril]] from [[Iron Crown|Morgoth's Crown]] as a bride-price. Beren accepted and after he departed Daeron's curse of silence lifted, though Daeron did not resume his music, nor Lúthien her singing or dancing.<ref name=c5>{{LB|C5}}</ref>\n\n=== Escape of Lúthien===\nLater, Lúthien learned from Melian that Beren had been captured by [[Sauron]] and in her despair came upon Daeron. She asked him to play music for her heartache and dread, and Daeron reluctantly did so, playing a song of sadness which stayed all things in the woods and caused all mirth to be forgotten. Once he had finished, Lúthien then begged him to accompany her to aid Beren; at this Daeron stated he had no love for Beren nor wept for his captivity, but that he would defend Lúthien from peril and wondering into hell. Lúthien, assuming this meant he would help, thanked him and left, but Daeron instead went directly to Thingol and informed him of Lúthien's intentions. Thingol thanked Daeron, and proclaimed that love would ever be between them, and named him a prince.<ref name=c5>{{LB|C5}}</ref>\n\nOut of fear for her safety Thingol put Lúthien into captivity, placing her in a house built high within the great tree [[Hírilorn]], intending to keep her there until she grew wiser and the spell of madness left her. Daeron, grieving for Lúthien's captivity, frequently came to the base of the tree and played melodies on his flute. Lúthien eventually forgave Daeron for his betrayal, and he alone was allowed to cross her threshold. Eventually, she asked Daeron to use his woodcraft and fashion for her a small loom in order to pass the time. Daeron did this, and after giving it to inquired what she planed on making: when she then told him it would be an enchanted thread, Daeron feared the dark purpose of her art, but spoke no word to Thingol of it.<ref name=c5>{{LB|C5}}</ref>\n\nAfter Lúthien departed in secret from Doriath, Daeron sought for her in despair, and wandered upon strange paths until he eventually passed over the [[Blue Mountains]]. For many ages he made lament beside dark waters for Lúthien, daughter of Thingol, most beautiful of all living things.<ref name=beren />\n\n== Characteristics ==\nDaeron was physically described as \"Daeron the dark with ferny crown\".<ref name=\"llc\"/>\n\nHe was regarded as among the greatest musicians of the Elves, with only [[Maglor]] named in similar esteem.<ref name=beren />\n\nThingol described Daeron as wise, with wary ears and watchful eyes, who heeds and understands all who pass through his land.<ref name=\"llc\" />\n\nAs the Sindar held much in memory it was not their custom to write down their records or songs. As such, save in Menegroth, the Runes of Daeron were little used asides from names and brief inscriptions cut into wood, stone, or metal. The Dwarves who came to Menegroth learned the Cirth and were well-pleased by them, holding Daeron in higher esteem than his own folk; by them then runee were carried east over the Blue Mountains.<ref>{{WJ|P1e}}</ref>\n\nDaeron was also a skilled in woodcraft, as was noted by Lúthien when she requested he make her a small loom.<ref name=c5 />\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name derives from the [[Sindarin]] word ''daer'' (\"large, great\").<ref>{{VT|42a}}, p. 11</ref>\n\nIn the earlier [[Etymologies]] the [[Doriathrin]] name is given as '''Dairon''' shown as related to the Doriathrin word for shadow, ''dai''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 354 entry [[DAY]]</ref>\n\nConsequently, [[Christopher Tolkien]] speculated in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', that the name perhaps included the [[Sindarin]] word ''[[dae]]'' \"shadow\".<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n===The Book of Lost Tales===\n'''Dairon''' is first introduced in ''[[The Tale of Tinúviel]]'' from ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. While he plays a near identical role, he is the brother of Tinúviel (Lúthien) rather than an unrequited lover. He is described as \"a boy, strong and merry\" and along with [[Tinfang Warble]] and [[Ivárë]], one of the three most magical music players among the Elves.<ref name=Tinúviel>{{LT2|I}}</ref>\n\nChanges made within the Lost Tales are the children of \"Linwë Tinto\" and \"Wendelin\" being originally '''Timpinen''' (Tinfang) and Tinúviel;<ref>{{LT1|IVn}}</ref>{{rp|note 1}} and the name \"Dairon\" being preceded by '''Tifanto''', which itself was preceded by '''Kapalen'''.<ref name=tin_notes>{{LT2|In}}</ref>{{rp|note 9}}\n\nTifanto had originally joined the hunting of [[Karkaras]], for which he \"cast aside his pipe and grasped a spear\". As this passage was written after Dairon was already stated as becoming lost [[Christopher Tolkien]] speculated that [[J.R.R. Tolkien|his father]], noticing the contradiction, then replaced Dairon at this instance with the new character [[Mablung]].<ref name=tin_notes />{{rp|note 12}}\n\n=== Other ===\nIn ''[[The Quenta]]'' Dairon was \"the greatest of the musicians of the Elves, save Maglor son of Fëanor, and Tinfang Warble\", though this was emended to \"and Maglor son of Fëanor and Tinfang Gelion alone are named with him\".<ref>{{SM|Q10}}</ref>\n\nIn drafts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', other names were considered for the minstrel of Doriath: ''\"[[Ilverin]]\"'', ''\"Iverin\"'', ''\"Neldorín\"'', ''\"Elberin\"'', and ''\"Diarin\"''.<ref>{{RS|Index}}</ref>\n\nIn earlier versions of ''[[Narn i Hîn Húrin]]'' Saeros was said to be a kinsman, and then brother, of Daeron.<ref>{{UT|2n}}</ref>{{rp|note 8}}\n\nIn a commentary and history on language interrelation, [[Celebrimbor]] was stated as a Sinda who claimed descent from Daeron.<ref>{{PM|XIntro}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:Chroniclers of Arda]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Minstrels]]\n[[Category:Moriquendi]]\n[[Category:Sindar]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n[[de:Daeron]]\n[[fr:encyclo:personnages:elfes:teleri:sindar:daeron]]\n[[fi:Daeron]]"}}}
