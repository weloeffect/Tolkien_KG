Tolkien]]'s works. It was published as No. 32 in the ''[[Cormarë Series]]''.\n\n==From the publisher==\n\n{{blockquote|\"Tolkien and Philosophy\" is a theme that has not yet been studied with the \"philological\" accuracy and the textual knowledge that are required to avoid squeezing the Professor's works inside conceptual frameworks that, rather than exposing their intrinsic value, risk losing both their profound meaning and their inherent beauty. What is the relationship between Tolkien's work and Philosophy? The question, if taken seriously, is by no means trivial. For these reasons we wish this book to become, in both method and content, an essential point of reference for anyone interested in better understanding the significant elements that sometimes link, sometimes divide, the \"philologist\" Tolkien from proper speculative philosophy.}}\n\n==Contents==\n\n* Introduction\n** By: Roberto Arduini and Claudio A.
