Tolkien]] was born.\n\nOriginally founded as ''Transorangia'' (''Transoranje'') on 17 February 1854 by the ''Voortrekkers'' (Dutch for \"pioneers\"), former Dutch colonists of the Cape Colony. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] was born there in [[1892]] as his father, [[Arthur Tolkien]], headed the [[Bloemfontein]] branch of a British bank, but returned to England with his mother at the age of three. \n\nDuring 1899 and 1902 the Orange Free Country and the [[wikipedia:South African Republic|South African Republic]], a Boer Republic in the current South-African provinces [[wikipedia:Gauteng|Gauteng]], [[wikipedia:Limpopo|Limpopo]] and [[wikipedia:Mpumalanga|Mpumalanga]], fought the Second Boer War with the [[wikipedia:British Empire|British Empire]]. In the [[wikipedia:Treaty of Vereeniging|Treaty of Vereeniging]] it was decided that Orange Free Country would become part of the British Empire as the '''Orange River Colony'''. In 1910 it joined the Union of South-Africa under its former name, Orange Free Country. \n\nIn [[1944]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] spent time in Free State Province, training for the Royal Air Force. During this stay he [[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien|corresponded]] extensively with his father about the elder Tolkien's  reminiscences of South Africa, as well as newly written chapters of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n\nToday, the area of the former Orange Free State is now the '''[[wikipedia:Free State|Free State]]''' (Afrikaans: ''Vrystaat'') province of [[wikipedia:Republic of South Africa|South Africa]].\n\n==External links==\n* {{WP|Orange Free State|Orange Free State}}\n\n[[Category:Countries]]\n[[C:South African locations]]\n[[de:Südafrika]]\n[[fi:Oranjen vapaavaltio]]"}}}
