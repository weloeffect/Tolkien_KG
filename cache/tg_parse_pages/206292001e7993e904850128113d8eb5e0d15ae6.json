R. R. Tolkien’s popularity has never been higher. In ''Green Suns and Faërie'', author Verlyn Flieger, one of world’s foremost Tolkien scholars, presents a selection of her best articles—some never before published—on a range of Tolkien topics.<br/><br/>The essays are divided into three distinct sections. The first explores Tolkien’s ideas of sub-creation–the making of a Secondary World and its relation to the real world, the second looks at Tolkien’s reconfiguration of the medieval story tradition, and the third places his work firmly within the context of the twentieth century and “modernist” literature. With discussions ranging from Tolkien’s concepts of the hero to the much-misunderstood nature of Bilbo’s last riddle in ''The Hobbit'', Flieger reveals Tolkien as a man of both medieval learning and modern sensibility—one who is deeply engaged with the past and future, the regrets and hopes, the triumphs and tragedies, and above all the profound difficulties and dilemmas of his troubled century.<br/><br/>Taken in their entirety, these essays track a major scholar’s deepening understanding of the work of the master of fantasy. ''Green Suns and Faërie'' is sure to become a cornerstone of Tolkien scholarship.}}\n\n==Content==\n\n* Preface and Acknowledgments \n* Abbreviations and Conventions \n\n;PART ONE - Tolkien Sub-creator \n* Fantasy and Reality: J.R.R.
