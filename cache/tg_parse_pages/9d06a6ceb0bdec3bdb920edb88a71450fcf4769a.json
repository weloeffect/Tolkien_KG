It features statues of the Nazgûl. [[Radagast]], not [[Gandalf]], enters Dol Guldur. He is attacked by the [[Witch-king]], obtains a [[Morgul-knife|Morgul blade]], and finds that Dol Guldur is occupied by a [[Sauron|Necromancer]]. He then travels to Gandalf to tell him the news and gives him the sword as proof. (According to the concept artists [[Alan Lee]] and [[John Howe]], the film's version of Dol Guldur was designed to look like an old structure built by the [[Númenóreans]] during the [[Second Age]] that had subsequently fallen into disrepair.)<ref>[[Brian Sibley]], [[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug: Official Movie Guide]] 2013, p. 72-78</ref>\n\n'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''\n:Gandalf enters Dol Guldur to investigate its ruins. There he meets [[Azog]] and his army. He tries to escape, but is trapped by [[Sauron|the Necromancer]], who reveals to Gandalf his true identity. Gandalf is later seen trapped in one of the cages.\n\n'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''\n:[[Galadriel]] enters Dol Guldur in order to rescue Gandalf. Accompanied by [[Saruman]] and [[Elrond]] they encounter Sauron and [[Nazgûl|the Nine]]. The [[Attack on Dol Guldur|Attack]] begins and Sauron flees to [[Mordor|the East]].\n\n===Games===\n'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring]]'':'''\n:Dol Guldur makes appearance during both \"Good\" and \"Evil\" campaigns as a site of a major battleground.\n\n'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''\n:Dol Guldur is commanded by the [[Mouth of Sauron]], not [[Khamûl]]. Dol Guldur (or Mordor itself) sent a huge army of Orcs, Haradrim, and Trolls to assault [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. The attack fails, and the Mouth of Sauron is killed along with all the attacking force. Dol Guldur is then itself attacked by a combined army of Elves and Dwarves led by [[Elrond]], [[Arwen]], [[Glorfindel]], [[Glóin]], and [[Dáin Ironfoot]]. After a long and hard struggle, the Elves and Dwarves finally overrun Dol Guldur and lay waste to the evil that dwelled there, ending Sauron's war campaign in the North once and for all.\n\n:In the Evil Campaign, the Goblins from Dol Guldur eliminate the Elves and the Ents that guard the Forest Road in Mirkwood.\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Dol Guldur is a central point in the game's second expansion, ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Siege of Mirkwood]]''. In its storyline, Celeborn and Galadriel organize a military campaign against Dol Guldur while the Fellowship still resides in Lothlórien (not to be confused with the later battle during the War of the Ring). The announced goal is to sow chaos into Orc forces by destroying as many of their troops, weapons and supplies as possible, to delay an inevitable assault upon Lothlórien. The true purpose, however, is to distract the Eye of Sauron from the company departing down the shores of Anduin.\n\n:An assault by the \"Golden Host\" of the Galadhrim is successful despite minor losses and after establishing multiple camps throughout southern Mirkwood arrives at the walls of the fortress itself. However, without the White Lady they do not have the means of bringing down the walls, so the Elves prepare to swiftly fall back beyond Anduin before the main forces of the Enemy arrive. The players can also explore multiple locations within the fortress, among them the \"Necromancer's Gate\", the baileys of Dol Guldur, the \"Sword-hall of Dol Guldur\", the Dungeons of Dol Guldur, the chief tower \"Barad Guldur\", and \"Sammath Gul\" - the chambers once occupied by the Dark Lord himself.\n\n:Much later, after the [[War of the Ring]], the Galadhrim and [[Elves of Mirkwood]] lead a great assault on Dol Guldur, where Galadriel casts down the walls of the stronghold, and renames the hill ''Dol Dhannen'', \"The Hill of Ruin\". In the process of assisting the Lady in this players discover another location, \"Gostador\", the secret dungeon in which Sauron let his physical form recover from his defeat at the end of the Second Age, and where he held audiences with agents carrying out his plans in other parts of Middle-earth.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Attack on Dol Guldur]]\n*[[Fall of Dol Guldur]]\n*[[Sauron|Necromancer]]\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Buildings]]\n[[Category:Fortresses]]\n[[Category:Rhovanion]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n\n[[de:Dol Guldur]]\n[[fi:Dol Guldur]]\n[[fr:encyclo:geographie:villes tours et forteresses:rhovanion:dol guldur]]"}}}
