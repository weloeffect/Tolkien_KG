Wraiths appeared as leaders of the Enemy and elite forces in many areas. The most commonly encountered wraiths were the red-robed Cargûl. One of the game's main antagonists, [[Mordirith]], was a wraith who is the Steward of [[Angmar]].\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Servants of Sauron]]\n[[Category:Undead]]"}}}
