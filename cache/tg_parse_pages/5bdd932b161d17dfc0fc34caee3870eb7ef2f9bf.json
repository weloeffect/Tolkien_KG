It was a triangular peninsula laying between the rivers [[Isen]] and [[Adorn]], and represented the furthest western boundary of Rohan. It was declared to be part of Rohan at the [[Oath of Eorl]], but by the time of the [[War of the Ring]] its people's loyalty to Edoras was dubious, given their mixed Dunlending and Rohirric heritage.<ref name=\"Isen\">{{UT|Isen}}</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|2754}} the region was ruled by [[Freca]]. He had constructed a stronghold near the source of the Adorn and paid little heed to the king of Rohan at the time, [[Helm Hammerhand]]. After a disagreement over the proposal that Freca's son [[Wulf]] should marry Helm's daughter, Helm killed Freca with a single blow. This precipitated a war between the West-march (supported by the Dunlendings) and the rest of Rohan. Though Wulf was able to take [[Edoras]] for a time, he was eventually slain by Helm's nephew, [[Fréaláf]].<ref name=\"Eorl\">{{App|Eorl}}</ref>\n\nThe region was only fully reconquered for Rohan by King [[Folcwine]] nearly a hundred years later.<ref name=\"Eorl\" /> However, the people of the region had not forgotten the slaying of their lord by the time of the War of the Ring, and many sided with [[Saruman]] in {{TA|3019}}.<ref name=\"Isen\" />\n\n==Etymology==\n\n''[[Wikipedia:March (territory)|March]]'' here is used in the sense of \"borderland, especially one serving as a defence of the inner lands of a realm\", similar to the [[Riddermark]].<ref>[[Wayne G.
