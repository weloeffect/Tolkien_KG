He was a last-minute replacement for [[Stuart Townsend]], as director [[Peter Jackson]] did not believe Townsend looked old enough to play the part convincingly. Mortensen was considering turning down the part, but his son, who loved the books, encouraged him to take the role. His son, Henry Mortenson, also appears as a child of Rohan in [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]] and as a soldier extra in [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]].\n\n==Quotes==\n{{quote|There were plenty of reasons not to go.
