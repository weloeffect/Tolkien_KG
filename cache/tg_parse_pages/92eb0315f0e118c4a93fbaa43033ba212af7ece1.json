Its purpose was to unite all of the divided [[Elves]] in one cause, and ambassadors came from all the peoples and realms of Beleriand. From the eastern [[East Beleriand|March]] came warriors lead by [[Maedhros]] and [[Maglor]], though none of their [[Sons of Fëanor|brothers]] came. As well as Elves from the separate branches of the [[Noldor]], native [[Sindar|Grey-elves]] were also present, including wanderers of the woods and the [[Falathrim|folk]] of the [[Falas|Havens]] along with [[Círdan]]. Ambassadors even came from the [[Green-elves]], the people of distant [[Ossiriand]] in the east. Yet, from [[Doriath]], only [[Mablung]] and [[Daeron]] came with tidings from their [[Thingol|King]].<ref name=\"Return\"/>\n\nThe feast was hailed as a great success, and the Elves made common cause there against their great enemy to the north. For a few short years after the Mereth Aderthad, Beleriand enjoyed a time of peace and happiness before plunging into the [[War of the Great Jewels|Wars]] that would eventually destroy it, though the joy at the feast would be remembered for many years after.<ref name=\"Return\"/>\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Mereth Aderthad'' is [[Sindarin]] for \"Feast of Reuniting\", from the word ''[[mereth]]'' (\"feast\"),<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entry \"Mereth\"</ref> and possibly the word ''[[aderthad]]''.\n\nIn the [[Noldorin]] phase of the [[Languages|language]], ''Mereth Aderthad'' is glossed as \"Feast of Games and Reuniting\".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}</ref>\n\n{{references|notes}}\n[[Category:Festivals and feasts]]\n[[Category:First Age]]\n[[Category:Noldorin names]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n[[de:Mereth Aderthad]]\n[[fr:evenements/1a/mereth aderthad]]\n[[fi:Mereth Aderthad]]"}}}
