He will attempt to ignore these issues while celebrating Easter; however, while he  approves \"in the abstract of the reform of the liturgy... one feels a little dislocated and even a little sad at my age to know that the ceremonies and modes so long familiar and  deeply associated with the season will never be heard again!\".<ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 487</ref>\n*'''Publication:''' The letter first appeared in ''[[Gerard A.J.
