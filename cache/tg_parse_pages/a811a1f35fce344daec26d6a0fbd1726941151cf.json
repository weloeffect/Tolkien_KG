Along with their close [[Dwarves of Belegost|kinsmen]] in [[Belegost]], they were among the [[Dwarves of the Blue Mountains]].\n\n==History==\nDuring the [[Years of the Trees]] the western [[Fathers of the Dwarves]] awoke from beneath the [[Blue Mountains]] creating the lines of the [[Broadbeams]] and the [[Firebeards]]. These two houses built the great Dwarven cities of [[Nogrod]] and [[Belegost]] in the [[Blue Mountains]].<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref><ref group=note>It is not clear from the narratives whether each city belonged to either House, and whether the Dwarves of Nogrod consisted of either Firebeards or Broadbeams; it is possible that members of both Houses dwelled in either city.</ref>\n\nThey were initially friendly to the [[Elves]] of Beleriand, renowned as craftsmen and jewellers, such as [[Gamil Zirak]] whose works were to be found in the treasuries of King [[Thingol]] of [[Doriath]],<ref>{{UT|Narn}}, ''The Departure of Túrin''</ref> and [[Telchar]] known for the forging of weapons. Dwarves from the Blue Mountains, perhaps also those of Nogrod, aided the [[Noldor]] in the building of [[Nargothrond]].<ref name=doriath/><ref>{{S|13}}</ref>\n\nDwarves of Nogrod, as well as their kinsmen of Belegost, participated in the [[Union of Maedhros]] supplying them with soldiers and weapons.<ref>{{S|20}}</ref>\n\nSome craftsmen from Nogrod stayed in [[Menegroth]] and were asked by King [[Thingol]] of [[Doriath]] to set the [[Silmaril]] in the [[Nauglamir]]. But they coveted the Nauglamir and killed Thingol in his treasury, and fled, only to be slaughtered by the avenging Elves who killed all but two. The survivors returned to Nogrod, and lied to their kinsmen saying that Thingol refused to pay the craftsmen for their work and killed them. \n\nAlthough the [[Dwarves of Belegost]] refused to aid them, the Dwarves of Nogrod formed a great host which passed over [[Sarn Athrad]] intimidating the [[Sindar]] who fled before them. In the [[battle in the Thousand Caves|sack of Menegroth]], they ravaged the Caves and Thingol's treasures. But on their return home they were hunted down by [[Beren|Beren Erchamion]] and killed by his army of [[Green-elves]] and a group of [[Ents]] at the [[Battle of Sarn Athrad]] as they were crossing the river.<ref name=doriath>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>\n\nAfter the end of the [[First Age]], around {{SA|40}}, the power and wealth of Khazad-dûm was much increased; for it was enriched by many people and much lore and craft when the ancient cities of [[Nogrod]] and [[Belegost]] in the [[Blue Mountains]] were ruined in the breaking of [[Thangorodrim]].<ref name=\"Durin\"/> However, there always remained some Dwarves on the eastern side of the Blue Mountains in days afterwards.<ref>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''\n: The Dwarves of Nogrod are called '''Dwalin's Tribe'''.<ref>{{ICE|8004}}</ref><ref>[[Thomas Morwinsky]], \"A Brief History of the Dwarven Mansions\", in ''[[Other Minds]]'' issue 4 (July 2008)</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dwarves of Belegost]]\n\n{{References|n}}\n\n[[Category:Dwarven peoples]]\n[[de:Nogrod]]\n[[fi:Nogrod]]"}}}
