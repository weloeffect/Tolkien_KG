Tolkien]]. He did not attend a great deal of the Inklings meetings due to living and working in London, a ways away from the [[Eagle and Child]]. \n\nBarfield argued that language was more \"poetic\" in its more ancient forms noting that the same word described both a spiritual and physical reality for the ancient speakers, making no distinction. He noted, for example, that in some languages the word for \"heaven\" is the same as the word for \"sky\".<ref>Owen Barfield, ''Poetic Diction: A Study in Meaning'', CT: Weslyan University Press</ref>\n\nTolkien was very fond of Barfield's works and his linguistic views were most influenced by Barfield, specifically his concept of ancient and original unity between meaning and sound.<ref>[[Verlyn Flieger]], ''[[Green Suns and Faërie|Green Suns and Faerie: Essays on J.R.R.

I met him a number of times at meetings of the Inklings - I didn't go always - and also with Lewis.

His own fairy-tales, which are excellent, have now no market: and its first reading – children are so practical! – led to a universal wail 'You're not going to give it back to Mr. Lewis, are you?' All the things which the wiseacres on child psychology in our circle said when you wrote it turn out to be nonsense. 'They liked the sad parts,' said Tolkien, 'because they were sad and the puzzling parts because they were puzzling, as children always do.' The youngest boy liked Gamboy because 'she was clever and the bad people in books usually aren't.' The tags of the Podger have become so popular [as] to be almost a nuisance in the house.
