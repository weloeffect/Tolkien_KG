Following this battle, Morgoth perceived that Orcs alone, unless it were in numbers that he could not yet muster, would be no match against the [[Noldor]]. He thus started to consider new approaches, and came to the thought of [[dragon|dragons]].<ref name=ga115/>\n\n== After Dagor Bragollach ==\nAnother attack occurred seven years after the [[Dagor Bragollach]] when [[Morgoth]] sent an invasion of [[Hithlum]]. It began with a bitter attack through the passes of the [[Ered Wethrin]] and a siege of [[Eithel Sirion]].  At the fortress [[Galdor (Lord of Dor-lómin)|Galdor]] fell, pierced by an arrow.  [[Húrin]] replaced his father in command, and drove the Orcs from the mountains and across the sands of [[Anfauglith]]. However, an army also came from [[Angband]] into Hithlum from the north, leading to battle upon the plains.  Initially King [[Fingon]] was outnumbered and hard-pressed until [[Círdan]] sent a task force up the Firth of [[Drengist]] which fell upon the Orcs from the west. This broke the Orc-host, which fled to the [[Iron Mountains]].<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Conflicts of the First Age]]"}}}
