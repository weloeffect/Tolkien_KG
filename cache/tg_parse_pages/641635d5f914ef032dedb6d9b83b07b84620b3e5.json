It's unspecified on why Thorin had a meeting with all houses of the Dwarves, however it's likely for the purpose of declaring war on [[Smaug]] and to reclaim his homeland. \n\n'''2021: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Blacklocks.jpg|thumb|right|The \"Temámir\" in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n\n: The House corresponding to the Blacklocks is called the '''Temámir'''. Dark-skinned with raven-black hair, they are considered the wisest of the Seven Houses; their banners display a quill and written scrolls. The Temámir are described as being more prone to voyaging than other dwarves, even over sea. Their [[Seven Rings|Ring]] was either \"Taurya\", which was reclaimed by Sauron, or \"Tulcya\", which was consumed by the [[Dragons|dragon]] \"Thostír the Rank\".\n\n: The Temámir originate from the south, and have strongholds in [[Near Harad]] and [[Umbar]]. At the beginning of the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]], they were led by \"King Brítu the Redeful\". By the time of the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]], all that remained of the royal line was young princess \"Jegín\", who became King and ruled through the [[War of the Ring]] and its aftermath. After Azanulbizar, the [[Longbeards]] gave to the Temámir some of their halls in the [[White Mountains]] that they could no longer maintain. During the War of the Ring, these dwarves shut their gates and did not participate. Once the danger had passed, they emerged to take part in rebuilding [[Gondor]], for a price.\n\n{{references}}\n{{dwarvenclans}}"}}}
