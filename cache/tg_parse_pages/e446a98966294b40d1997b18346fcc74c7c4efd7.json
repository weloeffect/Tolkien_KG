There is no doubt that long afterwards, in the [[Third Age]], Saruman rediscovered this, or learned of it in lore, and in his lust for mastery committed this, his wickedest deed: the interbreeding of Orcs and Men, producing both Men-orcs large and cunning, and Orc-men treacherous and vile.<ref name=myths>{{MR|P5X}}, pp. 418-9</ref>}}\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Half-orcs in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Liz Danforth - Half-orc.jpg|''Half-orc'' in the ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]''\nFile:Omar Rayyan - Half-orcs.jpg|''Half-orcs'' in the ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Half-orc Bandit.jpg|''Half-orc Bandit'' in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n\n'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''\n: Half-orcs (Sindarin ''Piryrch'', sing.
