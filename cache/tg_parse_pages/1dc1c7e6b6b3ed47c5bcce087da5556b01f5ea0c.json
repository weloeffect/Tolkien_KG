The other two being the ''[[Minlamad thent/estent]]'', and the ''[[Linnod]]''.\n\n==History==\nThe verse form was used in the [[Song of Beren and Lúthien]] as chanted by [[Strider]] to the [[Hobbits]] beneath [[Weathertop]]. He stated that it was ''”hard to render in our [[Common Speech]]”''.<ref>{{FR|I11}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe ''ann-thennath'' can be broken up as follows: [[Sindarin]] ''[[and|ann]]'' = long, ''[[thenn]]'' = short, ''[[-ath]]'' = collective plural. ''Thennath'' could be related to the Elvish root ''ten''. In this case, the ''ann-thennath'' could mean ''long lines''.\n\n==Inspiration==\nThe English metric mode of ''Beren and Lúthien'' consists in a [[Wikipedia:Iambic tetrameter|iambic tetrameter]] (four pairs of ''unstressed and stressed'' syllable); in Classical Greek poetry however, the iambic tetrameter was originally 4 pairs of alternating ''short and long'' syllables, which is consistent to the meaning of the Sindarin term (\"long-short\"). This difference of terminology might account for Strider's adaptation/rendition from Sindarin (quantitative verse) to Westron (accentual-syllabic verse).\n\n[[Patrick Wynne]] and [[Carl F. Hostetter]] explain that the metric and rhyme of the English text tries to imitate what the ''ann-thennath'' would have been in the original Sindarin poem.<ref>[[Tolkien's Legendarium|''Tolkien's Legendarium: Essays on'' The History of Middle-earth]]: [[Patrick Wynne]] and [[Carl F.
