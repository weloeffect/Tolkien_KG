[[Christopher Tolkien]] identified it as [[Wikipedia:Arcturus|Arcturus]], the third brightest individual star visible in the Northern Hemisphere with an orange-yellow colour.\n\nIn \"[[The Coming of the Elves and the Making of Kôr]]\", [[Manwë]] suddenly became aware that the [[Elves]] had awoken.  Their arrival prompted [[Varda]] to create new stars to double the glory of the sky.  At the end of this task Varda was returning in great haste to [[Valinor]] and she dropped Morwinyon in the west where it blazes above the world's edge.<ref>{{LT1|V}}</ref>\n\nIn \"[[The Tale of the Sun and Moon]]\", it was said that jewel-makers caught their inspiration from the stars and \"not least did they love Morwinyon of the west, whose name meaneth the glint at dusk.\"<ref>{{LT1|VIII}}</ref>  In the commentary on this section of ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]'', Christopher Tolkien noted that Morwinyon was identified in both the [[Qenya]] and [[Gnomish]] word-lists as Arcturus.  Strangely, it is represented as always being in the western sky.  Apparently in the ancient myths of the Elves not all heavenly bodies moved from East to West.<ref>{{LT1|VIIIn}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nIn the ''[[Qenya Lexicon]]'', ''Morwinyon'' derives from two roots: MORO (\"glint in the dark\"), and GWINI, with a derivative word ''wintil'' (\"a glint\"). The [[Gnomish]] version is ''Morwinthi'', probably connected to ''gwim'' or ''gwinc'' (\"spark, flash\") or ''gwimla'' (\"wink, twinkle\").<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry \"Morwinyon\"</ref>\n{{References}}\n\n{{cosmology}}\n[[Category:Cosmology]]\n[[Category:Qenya names]]"}}}
