Their most famous product was [[Dungeons and Dragons]], though they also published [[Battle of the Five Armies (board game)|The Battle of the Five Armies]] board game and [[Dragon Magazine]]. Both games came under legal scrutiny in [[1977]] for unlicensed use of rights held by [[Tolkien Enterprises]].<ref>{{Cite web|articleurl=https://www.enworld.org/threads/q-a-with-gary-gygax.22566/page-149|articlename=Q&A with Gary Gygax|author=Gygax|website=[https://www.enworld.org En World]|dated=2003}}</ref><ref>[[Michael D.C.

TSR was by that time making most money with its tie-in novels, leading [[Wikipedia:Lorraine Williams|Lorraine Williams]], who then owned the company, to instead primarily aim for the ability to publish sequels. As [[John D. Rateliff]] puts it: ''“Lorraine wanted all the rights to create fiction, and computer games, and calendars, and spin-offs. Everything except publishing the books themselves.''” Seeking to obtain permission from the [[Tolkien Estate]], Rateliff was sent to England around [[1992]] to negotiate with [[Christopher Tolkien]]. Nothing came out of it, however.<ref>Ben Riggs (2022), ''A Secret History of Dungeons & Dragons'', pp. 147-151</ref>\n\nDeep in debt by the 1990s, TSR was acquired by [[Wizards of the Coast]] in [[1997]].\n\n{{References}}\n==External links==\n*[[wikipedia:TSR,_Inc.|Wikipedia article]]\n[[Category:American businesses]]"}}}
