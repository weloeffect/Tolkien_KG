Tolkien]], included in the chapter \"[[Poems Early Abandoned]]\" in ''[[The Lays of Beleriand]]''. It was written and left unfinished during his time at the [[University of Leeds]]. [[Christopher Tolkien]] explains that it probably comes from the early part of [[1925]] and was abandoned because his father started other poems. There are three manuscripts of the poem, each with just a few emendations, but different titles: ''The Flight of the Gnomes as sung in the Halls of Thingol'', ''Flight of the Gnomes'' and ''The Flight of the Noldoli from Valinor''.<ref name=LB>{{LB|2a}}</ref>{{rp|131}}\n==Synopsis==\nThe poem starts with the [[Darkening of Valinor|death of the Two Trees of Valinor]] and the mourning of the Elves in [[Túna|Tûn]]. A description of the [[Calaquendi|Three Kindreds]] of Elves is given. When the [[Gnomes]] gathered in the [[Great Square]] of [[Kôr|Côr]], [[Fëanor]] [[Speech_of_Fëanor#Lays_of_Beleriand|makes a speech]] against the [[Valar|Gods]], calling for a quest to recover the [[Silmarils]] from [[Morgoth]]. After naming the seven [[Sons of Fëanor]], the poem closes with the [[Oath of Fëanor]] and the Gnomes calling for [[Exile of the Noldor|rebellion]].\n\nThe poem ends abruptly, but apparently it would have continued with [[Finweg]] (later [[Fingon]]) Fingolfin's son answering to Fëanor's rebellion.\n\n==Analysis==\nIn the commentary of the poem, Christopher laments that his father abandoned it, as with its few lines it already has much interest for the study of the development of the legend.<ref name=LB/>{{rp|136}} Most notably, Fëanor becomes here a member of the Gnomish royal family, being the son of Finn ([[Finwë]]) and the brother of [[Fingolfin]].<ref name=LB/>{{rp|137–8}} The Oath of Fëanor is given here actual words for first time, as it only had been mentioned in the [[Gilfanon's Tale: The Travail of the Noldoli and the Coming of Mankind|Gilfanon's Tale]].<ref>{{LT1|X}}, pp. 238, 240</ref> The main changes with respect to the [[Book of Lost Tales|''Lost Tales'']] are the great importance of the [[Silmarils]], the Valar being numbered as Nine and Fëanor being son of Finn ([[Finwë]]).\nLike ''[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]'', this poem is written in [[alliterative verse]]. Christopher includes a metrical analysis made by his father of the first 20 first verses.<ref name=LB/>{{rp|140–1}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Noldolantë]]\n* [[Index:Poems by J.R.R.
