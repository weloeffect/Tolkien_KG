They are better pictures in themselves and also show far more attention to the text than any that have yet been submitted to me''\". Fairburn's illustrations included a pen-and-ink illustration of [[Gandalf]] on the tower of [[Orthanc]], and \"''a little sketch of [[Gollum]]''\", and Tolkien continues: \"''After seeing your specimens I am beginning to [...] think that an illustrated edition might be a good thing''\". Tolkien ends the letter by telling Fairburn that he would be \"''very pleased indeed''\" to see her other pictures when they are finished.\n\n*'''Description:''' Typewritten letter.\n*'''Publication:''' [[The Times Literary Supplement 14 September 2012|''The Times Literary Supplement'' 14 September 2012]].\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Letter to Mary Fairburn (4 September 1968)]]\n*[[Letter to Mary Fairburn (10 October 1968)]]\n*[[Letter to Mary Fairburn (4 November 1968)]]\n\n{{References}}\n{{title}}\n[[Category:Letters|Fairburn, Mary (1968-05)]]"}}}
