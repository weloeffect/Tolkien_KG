Then they gave a great cry: 'The Black Thorn of Brethil!'|''[[The Children of Húrin]]'', \"[[The Coming of Glaurung]]\"}}\n'''Gurthang''' was the sword of [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]], reforged from [[Anglachel]] the sword wielded by [[Beleg|Beleg Cúthalion]] when Túrin slew him in a tragic turn of events. \n\nIt was black and shone with a pale fire. With it Túrin performed great deeds but also senseless acts, and it broke when Túrin killed himself upon the sword.\n\n== History ==\nTúrin was led to [[Nargothrond]] by [[Gwindor]] who had aided Beleg in the rescue. Once in Nargothrond Túrin had Anglachel forged anew. He renamed the blade ''Gurthang'', \"Iron of Death\". The sword was wielded by Túrin throughout his time at Nargothrond as he became a captain and led the [[Elves of Nargothrond]] into open warfare, a tactic they were not well versed in. His increasing fame with Gurthang gave Túrin a new name: ''[[Mormegil]]'' \"The Black Sword\" of Nargothrond.<ref>{{CH|10}}</ref>\n\nTúrin's exploits with the Elves of Nargothrond culminated with the [[Battle of Tumhalad]] which led to the [[Fall of Nargothrond|ruin of Nargothrond]]. There Túrin faced [[Glaurung]] and rose his sword against the dragon, but then he stood still by an enchantment from the dragon's look. Briefly freed, Túrin tried to give stroke against Glaurung's eyes, but the dragon imposed upon him a new enchantment that led him towards [[Dor-lómin]].<ref>{{CH|11}}</ref> While running in despair with his black sword drawn, he was spotted by [[Tuor]] and [[Voronwë]].<ref>{{UT|1}}, pp. 37-38</ref>\n\nSoon later, Gurthang was used by Túrin to slay the [[Easterlings|Easterling]] chief [[Brodda]] in his own [[Brodda's hall|hall]]<ref>{{CH|12}}</ref> and it remained with him when he came to [[Brethil]]. There he was recognized by [[Dorlas]] as the Black Sword, but wishing to be rid of his past, Túrin put Gurthang away, using bows and spears instead.<ref>{{CH|13}}</ref> Only when orcs started to threaten Brethil in numbers did Túrin once again take up Gurthang to repulse them. When [[Glaurung]] came to Brethil pursuing Túrin, a desperate council was held in [[Ephel Brandir]] as to how to deal with the threat. Túrin told the [[Haladin]] of the tale of [[Azaghâl]] Lord of [[Belegost]] and how his knife forced Glaurung to flee, Túrin then declared \"''But here is a thorn sharper and longer than the knife of Azaghâl''\", and showed them Gurthang. Then the Haladin cried out \"''The Black Thorn of Brethil!''\"<ref>{{CH|16}}</ref>\n\nTúrin succeeded in slaying Glaurung with Gurthang at [[Cabed-en-Aras]] but fell into a swoon when he wrested it from Glaurung's belly.<ref>{{CH|17}}</ref> He was then told by [[Brandir]] that his wife was in fact his sister [[Nienor]] as recounted by Glaurung, and in a rage, Túrin slew Brandir. Discovering from [[Mablung]] that this was in fact true, Túrin returned to Cabed-en-Aras to commit suicide, addressing Gurthang with courteous words: \n\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Túrin Prepares to Take His Life.jpg||200px|thumb|''Túrin Prepares to Take His Life'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\n{{blockquote|'Hail Gurthang! No lord or loyalty dost thou know, save the hand that wieldeth thee. From no blood wilt thou shrink. Wilt thou therefore take Túrin Turambar, wilt thou slay me swiftly?' And from the blade rang a cold voice in answer: 'Yea, I will drink thy blood gladly, that so I may forget the blood of Beleg my master, and the blood of Brandir slain unjustly. I will slay thee swiftly.'<ref group=note>Unless one interprets Gurthang's answer as occurring solely within Túrin's mind, there exists only one other item in the [[legendarium]] which shows an ability to speak: the [[talking purse]] of the troll [[William]].</ref>}}\n\nTúrin cast himself upon Gurthang and the blade broke asunder. It was buried with Túrin beneath the [[Stone of the Hapless]].<ref>{{CH|18}}</ref> \n\nAccording to a prophecy, Túrin will use his black sword in the [[Final Battle]] to kill Morgoth definitely.<ref>{{LR|P2VI}}, p. 333</ref><ref group=note>As can be read in the [[Dagor Dagorath]] article, all the versions of the prophecy include a mention of the black sword.</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Gurthang'' is [[Sindarin]] for \"Iron of Death\",<ref>{{S|Index}}, entry \"Gurthang\"</ref> from ''[[gurth]]'' (\"death\") + ''[[ang]]'' (\"iron\").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entries ''[[gurth]]'', ''[[ang]]''</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\n[[File:Līga Kļaviņa - Turin.jpg||250px|thumb|''Túrin'' by [[:Category:Images by Līga Kļaviņa|Līga Kļaviņa]]]]\nIn the earliest version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', the black sword appears for first time when Túrin is already among the [[Rodothlim]]. He had not used any sword after killing Beleg, simply using a club, so he asked for a sword to Orodreth. A new one was made for him, \"and it was made by [[magic]] to be utterly black save at its edges, and those were shining bright and sharp as but [[Gnome]]-steel may be.\" It was heavy and had a black sheath. Túrin named it '''''Gurtholfin''''' (\"Wand of Death\"). It is said that sometimes the sword jumped to Túrin's hands by itself and whispered him dark words. Now Túrin began cleansing the lands of the Rodothlim from any enemy, and became known as the Blacksword, ''Mormagli'' or ''Mormakil'' among the Gnomes.<ref name=Foaloke>{{LT2|II}}</ref>{{rp|83–84}} \n\nThereafter, the sword has the same function in the story as in later versions: the failed confrontation with [[Glorund]],<ref name=Foaloke/>{{rp|85}} killing Brodda,<ref name=Foaloke/>{{rp|90}} saving [[Nienóri]],<ref name=Foaloke/>{{rp|99}} and the slaying of Glorund.<ref name=Foaloke/>{{rp|107}}\n\nThe sword had become Turambar's most precious possession, for all things died when touched by it, so he tried to recover it from the dragon's body and passed out because of the poison.<ref name=Foaloke/>{{rp|108}} Later, when Turambar knew the bitter truth, he asked death to the sword, claiming it was the only thing left to him, and Gurtholfin answered it would take any blood gladly. Thus Turambar cast himself upon the sword's point and died. In this version, there is no mention of the sword being broken.<ref name=Foaloke/>{{rp|112}}\n\nGurtholfin will also appear in the end of the world, as it is said that \"Turambar indeed shall stand beside Fionwë in the [[Great Wrack]], and [[Melko]] and his drakes shall curse the sword of Mormakil\".<ref name=Foaloke/>{{rp|116}}\n\n=== Early etymology ===\nThe name ''Gurtholfin'' (\"Wand of Death\") is in [[Gnomish]], from ''gurth(u)'' (\"death\") + ''olf(in)'' (\"branch, wand, stick\").<ref>{{LT2|Appendix}}, entry \"Gurtholfin\"</ref> The first form of the name was ''Gortholfin'', but it was changed during the writing of the narrative.<ref>{{LT2|II}}, \"Changes made to names in ''The Tale of Turambar'', p. 119</ref> Its [[Qenya]] cognate was '''''Urdolwen'''''.<ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 43</ref>\n\n== Inspiration ==\nThe scene of Túrin's suicide is directly inspired by the death of Kullervo in the ''[[Kalevala]]'', although Tolkien gave more importance to the sword in his story.<ref>[[Richard C. West]], \"Túrin's ''Ofermod'': An Old English Theme in the Development of the Story of Túrin\", in ''[[Tolkien's Legendarium]]'', ed. [[Verlyn Flieger]] and [[Carl F. Hostetter]], p. 239</ref> After knowing he had committed incest, Kullervo asks his sword to take his guilty flesh:\n{{blockquote|The sword [...]<br />answered with this word: \"Why<br />should I not eat what I like<br />not eat guilty flesh<br />not drink blood that is to blame?<br />I'll eat even guiltless flesh<br />I'll drink blameless blood\".<ref>[[Elias Lönnrot]], ''[[Kalevala|The Kalevala]]'', trans. Keith Bosley (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), p. 495</ref>}}\n\nIn the first version of the story in ''The Book of Lost Tales'' (see above), the words are even closer to the source of inspiration, as the black sword answers that it will drink any blood without distinction.<ref name=Foaloke/>{{rp|112}}\n\n{{references|n}}\n{{weapons}}\n[[Category:Pronounced articles]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n[[Category:Swords]]\n[[de:Gurthang]]\n[[fr:encyclo:artefacts:armes:gurthang]]\n[[fi:Gurthang]]"}}}
