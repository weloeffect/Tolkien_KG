He bore a Knight of Rohan in [[Éomer]]'s [[éored]] that engaged the [[Orcs]] outside [[Fangorn Forest|Fangorn]]. His rider was lost during the skirmish, but Arod himself survived and remained with the rest of the éored on their way back. In [[the Wold]], Éomer loaned him to [[Legolas]].<ref>{{TT|III2}}</ref> \n\nArod served his new rider faithfully, and for much of this time, Arod carried also Legolas's friend [[Gimli]]. At the [[Paths of the Dead]] Legolas spoke [[Elvish]] to calm the beast so that he would enter the [[Dark Door]].<ref>{{RK|V2}}</ref> Presumably he bore Legolas on his way throughout the [[War of the Ring]] and during the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].<ref name=guide>{{HM|Guide}}, entry \"Arod\"</ref> Legolas and Gimli rode upon Arod with the rest of their company to take [[Théoden]]'s body from the [[Hallows]] in [[Minas Tirith]], to rest in [[Edoras]].<ref>{{RK|VI6}}</ref>\n\nAccording to both versions of the unpublished Epilogue, Sam told his son Merry that Legolas let Arod run free when he and Gimli entered Fangorn.<ref>Christopher Tolkien (ed.), ''Sauron Defeated'' (''The History of Middle-earth'' v.
