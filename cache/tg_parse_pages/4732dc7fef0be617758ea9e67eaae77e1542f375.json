In general, there is no hard and fast rule governing which topics should be included but this page seeks to highlight where specific policies do exist. \n\n==In-universe concepts==\nAll characters, locations, events, objects, races, and concepts specific to the works of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] can - and should - be included on this encyclopaedia. \n\n==Individuals==\nEach [[:Category:People by name|individual]] needs to be judged on a case by case basis. In general, [[:Category:Authors|authors]], [[:Category:Artists|artists]], [[:Category:Actors and actresses|actors]], and others who have made a significant impact are included, but there is no need to include every actor, for example (especially if they've performed in a more minor role). In terms of authors and scholars, the number, length and impact of their contributions should be taken into account when judging whether they are notable enough to be included on [[Tolkien Gateway]].\n\n==Publications==\nAll publications containing a contribution by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] should be included on [[Tolkien Gateway]] without exception. With regards to Tolkien's works, major textual variants/editions can be included (for example, [[The Hobbit (50th Anniversary edition)|''The Hobbit'' (50th Anniversary Edition)]]), but each individual printing does not require its own article. Articles listing editions and translations are also noteworthy. \n\nAll publications exclusively about [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] (and his works) should also be included on this wiki. Similarly, information about individual journals and fanzines should be included, but only individual issues when the journal is of especial significance to Tolkien scholarship and fandom (such as ''[[Vinyar Tengwar]]'' and ''[[Mallorn (journal)|Mallorn]]''). Books based on adaptations as well as works containing a significant portion about Tolkien can also have their own article.\n\n===Foreign-language publications===\nTolkien Gateway is an English-language website. For foreign-language publications to be included on Tolkien Gateway, it must meet one of the following criteria:\n\n#The publication contains works by Tolkien never before printed in English (e.g. the interview in ''[[I fantasins världar]]'');\n#The publication contains Tolkien criticism/analysis never before printed in English (e.g. ''[[Curso de Quenya]]'');\n#The publication represents a significant bibliographic milestone (e.g. ''[[Hompen]]'', the first foreign-language translation of a work by Tolkien);\n#As a result of the above or otherwise, there is a legitimate belief that the publication would be of interest to native English-language speakers. (e.g. ''[[Ring of Darkness]]'').\n\n==Toys, games and collectibles==\nToys and games should not receive individual [[Help:Glossary#A|articles]] but be covered in one article for the entire set (see [[Lego]], for example). Individual [[:Category:Video games|video games]] and [[:Category:Board games|board games]] are also regarded as being notable.\n\nCurrently [[Tolkien Gateway]] does not cover collectibles, but it has done in the past and may do so again in the future.\n\n[[Category:Tolkien Gateway]]"}}}
