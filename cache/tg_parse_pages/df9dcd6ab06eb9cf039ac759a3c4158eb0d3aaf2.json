The northern stream had its source near the [[High Pass]]. The southern stream flowed through the deep valley of [[Rivendell]]. The two streams joined a few miles southwest of Rivendell and then flowed southwest until the Loudwater flowed into the river [[Mitheithel]]. The Bruinen had only one known ford, the [[Ford of Bruinen|Ford]] near Rivendell.<ref name=\"Map\">{{FR|Map}}</ref>\n\nIt is certain that the southern stream was called Bruinen or Loudwater, because [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s room in Rivendell \"looked south across the ravine of the Bruinen\"<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}, p. 238</ref> and Frodo \"walked along the terraces above the loud-flowing Bruinen\"<ref>{{FR|Council}}, p. 239</ref>. It is probable that the northern stream was also called the Bruinen or Loudwater, because Rivendell lay in the lands east of Loudwater<ref name=\"Eriador\">{{App|Eriador}}, p. 1039</ref> and the southern stream in the valley of Rivendell flows almost straight from east to west while the northern stream makes a turn to the flow to the southwest north of Rivendell so that the valley of Rivendell lies east from this section of the northern stream before it joins the southern stream<ref name=\"Map\"/>.\n\n==History==\nAfter the founding of the realm of [[Arnor]] in {{SA|3320|n}},<ref>{{App|SA}}, entry for the year 3320, p. 1084</ref> the Loudwater formed its eastern border.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, p. 1039</ref> In {{TA|861}},<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 861, p. 1085</ref> when Arnor was divided into the splinter-kingdoms of [[Arthedain]], [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]], the river was the eastern border of Rhudaur.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', p. 1040</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|1150}}<ref name=\"TA1150\">{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1150, p. 1085</ref> the [[Stoors]], one of the three kinds of [[Hobbits]], left their homes at the bank of the river [[Anduin]] and migrated to the west,<ref name=\"Hobbits\">{{FR|Hobbits}}, p. 3</ref> crossed the Misty Mountains over the [[Redhorn Gate|Redhorn Pass]]<ref name=\"TA1150\"/> and followed the course of the Loudwater southwards and settled between [[Tharbad]] and the borders of [[Dunland]]<ref name=\"Hobbits\"/>.\n\nWhen [[Thorin]] and company went to reclaim [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], they crossed the Bruinen after their adventure with the [[Trolls]], before they long paused at Rivendell.<ref>{{H|Rest}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the [[War of the Ring]] [[Frodo Baggins]] was carried on [[Glorfindel]]'s horse towards the Ford of Bruinen, with the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]] in hot pursuit. At the Ford Frodo, poisoned by a [[Morgul-wound]], made his stand, and defied the [[Witch-king|Lord of the Nazgûl]].<ref name=\"Flight\">{{FR|Flight}}, pp. 212-15</ref> This lured the Ringwraiths into the Bruinen,<ref name=\"Flight\"/> and Elrond commanded the river to form a great flood and [[Gandalf]] turned the shape of some of the waves into the form of white riders on white horses<ref name=\"Meetings\">{{FR|Meetings}}, p. 224</ref>. This flood carried away the the horses and the Ringwraiths, buying the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] some time.<ref name=\"Flight\"/> Gandalf was convinced that the horses of the Ringwraiths had been killed in the river, but that the Ringwraiths had survived.<ref name=\"Meetings\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nTolkien translated the name as '''Loudwater'''.<ref>{{FR|Flight}}, p. 200</ref> [[Patrick H. Wynne]] suggested that ''Bruinen'' is Sindarin and linked the first element ''brui'' (\"noisy\") to the second element of the word ''[[Ulumúri]]'', and several other [[Qenya]] and [[Gnomish|Goldogrin]] words with some connection to \"great sound\". The second element is ''[[nen]]'' (\"water\").<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Patrick H.
