The latter qualities, however, were now rather tolerated (in the rich) than generally approved. \n\n==Territory, origins and customs==\nTooks were mainly of [[Fallohides|Fallohide]] Hobbit stock, and had quite a reputation for unusual behavior (among other things being more adventurous than the other Hobbits<ref name=\"hobbits\">{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>), a quality not valued in the Shire. For this they would be seen as less respectable, but those traits were \"tolerated\" thanks to their large numbers and wealth.<ref name=ordering>{{FR|Ordering}}</ref> An absurd legend among other families, was that one of the Took ancestors married a [[fairies|fairy]]. The [[Istari|Wizard]] [[Gandalf]] was a known, if disreputable, associate.<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref> \n \nThe majority of the Tooks lived in the [[Great Smials]] of [[Tuckborough]] and in the surrounding area of [[Tookland]], which lay in the [[Westfarthing]].<ref name=ordering/><ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref>  A smaller clan called the '''[[North-took Family|North-tooks]]''' who lived far up in [[Long Cleeve]]; these were descendants of the legendary hero [[Bandobras Took]].<ref name=\"Took\">{{App|Took}}</ref>\n\nAs was customary in traditional hobbit families, the head of the Took family (\"The Took\") ruled the clan with his wife, thus upon his death, she continued to rule as the matriarch of the family. Such was the case with [[Lalia Clayhanger]] who succeeded her husband, [[Fortinbras Took II|Fortinbras]], to clan leadership. However, the Thainship passed only through male descent, so her son, [[Ferumbras Took III|Ferumbras III]], was the Thain immediately after his father’s death.<ref name=\"letter\">{{L|214}}</ref>\n\nTook men usually were given high-sounding names which evoked battles, weapons or figures of legend, like Fortimbras or Isembold.

Two of his sons, [[Hildifons Took|Hildifons]] and [[Isengar Took|Isengar]], were a few of the Hobbits who \"went off\" for adventures, sometimes inspired by Gandalf. Young [[Bilbo Baggins]], Gerontius's grandson, used to pester Gandalf for information about his uncles and other Hobbits who sought adventures.<ref>{{UT|Erebor}}, Appendix</ref>\n\nHobbit heroes of the later Third Age, Bilbo Baggins and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] both had Took mothers. [[Peregrin Took|Peregrin \"Pippin\" Took]], son of Thain [[Paladin II]], participated in the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] and the [[War of the Ring]].\n\nAfter the War Peregrin became the Thain; in {{SR|1484|n}} he handed his office to his son, [[Faramir Took I]] and rode away from the Shire (later it is said that he and Meriadoc were laid to rest beside the bed of [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] after his passing).<ref>{{App|Later}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Fourth Age]] the Great Smials became an important repository of historic books and records.<ref>{{FR|Records}}</ref>\n==Family Tree of the Tooks of the Great Smials==\nShowing the line of the Thains and prominent members of the Took clan.<ref name=\"Took\"/>  The figures after the names are those of birth (and death where that is recorded).
