When told it was Gollum, it changed little: he had read ''[[The Hobbit]]'' when he was eight, but nothing else. Not until his (later) wife Lorraine convinced him to go to the audition did he actually think of doing it. \n\nHe recorded a demo, in which he portrayed Gollum full of self-pity and guilt, and he based the gulping swallow sound \"gollum\" on his cat Diz coughing up a furball. \n\nAt the advice of [[Fran Walsh]], he kept a diary, and this diary was later edited to become ''[[Gollum: How We Made Movie Magic]]''. It details his casting, the shooting, the additional motion capture, and the voice dubbing pick-ups. \n\nSerkis spent a total of five years in [[New Zealand]], and did extra work later in London. He dubbed most of his lines as Gollum there, and also provided an eerie voice for the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]]. Together with [[Jim Dunk]], he also voiced most of the [[Uruk-hai]] in [[Uglúk]]'s troop.\n\n==Quotes==\n{{quote|They're only scorned because they're into something popular.
