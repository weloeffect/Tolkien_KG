Win hands and use the cards you've won to deal damage to opponents, or heal allies and help them with extra cards. Each character assigns cards differently, so use your skills wisely! Fight the forces of evil as Gandalf, Thorin, or Bilbo, or smash the hopes of the heroes as Smaug or Bolg, the goblin leader.<ref name=FF/>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite.asp?eidm=223 Official website]\n\n{{references}}\n{{Navbox cards}}\n{{title|italics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:The Hobbit Card Game}}\n[[Category:Card games]]"}}}
