The western wall was formed by the [[Ered Lómin]] or \"Echoing Mountains\", which curved north-westward to [[Helcaraxë]].  The land of [[Lammoth]] lay west of the Ered Wethrin and was not part of Beleriand or Hithlum, and the land of [[Nevrast]] was separated from Hithlum by the southern part of the Ered Lómin.<ref name=\"Map\">{{S|Map}}</ref>  Hithlum was cold and rainy, but quite fertile.<ref name=\"Bel\"/>\n\nHithlum was subdivided in [[Mithrim]], where the High Kings of the [[Noldor]] had their halls,<ref name=\"Bel\"/> and [[Dor-lómin]], which later became a fief of the [[House of Hador]].<ref>{{S|West}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe northern highlands, such as the mountains about Hithlum, were raised during the battles of the [[Ainur]] during the [[Battle of the Powers]].<ref>{{S|3}}</ref>\n\nHithlum was populated by the [[Elves of Mithrim]], who were the [[Sindar]], since the [[First Age]]. The Noldor entered Hithlum via the [[Firth of Drengist]] and first camped at the shores of [[Lake Mithrim]]. The land was covered by mists and vapours from the [[Thangorodrim]], and thus they named it '''Hísilómë''' or '''Land of Mist'''.<ref name=\"Bel\"/> [[Thingol]] gave leave to the Noldor to settle it and was ruled by [[Fingolfin]] and [[Fingon]] from its northern lands.<ref name=return>{{S|Return}}</ref> \n\nLater in the [[First Age]], Hithlum was [[assaults on Hithlum|continually under attack]] by [[Morgoth]], but its natural defences, fortified by fortresses such as [[Barad Eithel]], proved impassable.<ref name=\"Map\"/> Almost a century after the [[Dagor Aglareb]], a small number of [[Orcs]] came from the [[Firth of Drengist]] from the west, but once they were spotted, Fingon pushed them back into the sea.<ref name=return/>\n\nIn {{FA|416}} Fingolfin granted [[Hador]] a hereditary fiefdom in [[Dor-lómin]],<ref>{{S|Men}}</ref> where he gathered most of the people of his kin, thus forming the noble '''[[House of Hador]]'''.<ref>{{GA|136}}</ref> The mountains protected Hithlum during the [[Dagor Bragollach]], after which [[Edain]] of the [[House of Beor|First House]] came from [[Dorthonion]] as refugees and joined those of Hador.<ref name=ruin/> \n\nSeven years after the Dagor Bragollach, Morgoth sent a great force against Hithlum, attacking the passes of the Ered Wethrin. [[Galdor (Lord of Dor-lómin)|Galdor]] died defending the [[Eithel Sirion]]; in a second attempt the [[Falathrim]] sailed up the Firth of Drengist, then assisted Fingon by striking the unsuspecting orcs from the west.<ref name=ruin>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>\n\nHithlum eventually was lost after the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]. The Hadorians were scattered, killed, or enslaved, the Noldor who could not flee in time were enslaved in Morgoth's mines. Morgoth feigned to gave the [[Swarthy Men]] the lands of Hithlum as a reward, but in truth they were actually trapped there.<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>\n\nHithlum was completely destroyed during the [[War of Wrath]].<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Hithlum.mp3|Ardamir}}\n''Hithlum'' is a [[North Sindarin]] word,<ref name=PE17/> meaning \"Mist-shadow\" (''[[hith]]'' + ''[[lum]]''), a translation from [[Quenya]] '''''Hísilómë''''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˌhisiˈloːme]}}, stem ''Hisilómi-'').<ref>{{S|Index}}, ''Hísilómë''</ref> Its classical [[Sindarin]] name is said to be '''''Hithlũ'''''.<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, p. 133</ref>  \n\n[[J.R.R.
