However it is probably far older, as there is no definite record that it was one of the many things the Sindar learned from the [[Noldor]].<ref name=Ñaltalma/><ref group=note>This seems to suggest that both the Noldor and the Sindar may have adopted it from a time earlier than [[Fëanor]]; eg. the latest during the [[Great March]].</ref>\n\nIn the later [[Ages]], the history of its origins, as well as details of its form and usage, have been lost from records.<ref name=Ñaltalma/>\n\n==Characteristics==\nDetails about the device's form and usage are lost in history. It can be discerned at least that it evidently was portable (could be carried in pocket or pouch) and had a bright surface to use the light of the [[Sun]] or the clear [[Moon]], and direct its flashes to an intended watcher; however the flashes it generated/reflected were not visible by [[Men]] (at least from distance).<ref name=Ñaltalma>{{NM|P3xvi}}, pp. 353-4, note 9</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Ñaltalma'' is not glossed, but it is clearly [[Quenya]], containing the element ''[[ñalta]]'' (\"radiance, glittering reflection\").\n\nIts [[Sindarin]] name was '''''glathralvas''''' (\"flashing glass/crystal\").<ref name=Ñaltalma/>\n\n==Inspiration==\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] describes the object as a [[Wikipedia:Heliograph|heliograph]], a common communication device in the British Army. As [[Carl F. Hostetter]] comments, Tolkien had to be well familiarized with the heliograph, as he trained in military signalling and became Battalion Signalling Officer in [[1916]], although the own manual of his training described the heliograph as not suitable for Great Britain's atmosphere.<ref name=Ñaltalma/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fëanorian lamps]]\n\n{{references|n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Naltalma}}\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Quenya nouns]]"}}}
