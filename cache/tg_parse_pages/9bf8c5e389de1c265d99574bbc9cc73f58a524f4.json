He was said to have wedded an [[Elves|Elf-maid]] named [[Mithrellas]], a wandering companion of [[Nimrodel]]. His son [[Galador]] was the first [[Prince of Dol Amroth]].<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}, ''Amroth and Nimrodel''</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe meaning of the name is not known, however it includes [[Adûnaic]] ''zôr'' which means \"flame\" or \"foam\".\n\nThe first element ''imra'' (perhaps from *''imar'') is not translated but it also appears in the name of his descendant, [[Imrahil]] and perhaps [[Imâr]].\n\nImrazôr, who seems to have retained the usage of Adûnaic in his House, was also known as the '''Númenórean'''. Why a Gondorian noble of the Third Age would be called the \"Númenórean\" is not made clear from the context.<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, ''The Line of Dol Amroth'', p. 220-222</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | |ADR| |ADR=[[Adrahil (Captain of the Left Wing)|Adrahil]]<br/><small>''c. 1944''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | |:| |}}\n{{familytree | | | |IMR|y|MIT|IMR='''IMRAZȎR'''<br/><small>''1950-2076''</small>|MIT=''[[Mithrellas]]''}}\n{{familytree | | | | |,|-|^|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree | | | |GAL| |GIL| |GAL= [[Galador]]<br/><small>''2004-2129''</small>|GIL=''[[Gilmith]]''}}\n{{familytree | | | | |:| |}}\n{{familytree | | | |SEC| |SEC=''[[Princes of Dol Amroth]]''}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn an early manuscript Imrazôr and not his son was numbered as the first Prince of Dol Amroth.<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, ''The Line of Dol Amroth'', p. 221-222</ref>\n\n{{notes}}\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Imrazor}}\n[[Category:Dúnedain]]\n[[Category:Adûnaic names]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[de:Imrazôr]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/hommes/3a/dunedain/gondoriens/imrazor]]\n[[fi:Imrazôr]]"}}}
