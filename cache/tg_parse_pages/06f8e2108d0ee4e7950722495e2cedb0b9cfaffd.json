At this time and during the War of the Ring, the Third Marshal was [[Éomer]], son of [[Éomund]] (also a Marshal) and nephew of King Théoden.  Éomer’s base of operations was at [[Aldburg]] in the [[Folde]].\n\nAfter Théodred was slain and King Théoden had regained his health, Éomer effectively became First Marshall of the Riddermark, although did not officially take that title. [[Erkenbrand]] took command of the Western Muster.  At the Full Muster ahead of the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], [[Grimbold]] took command of the Muster of the West-mark, however the title of Third Marshal was not given.  Grombold was slain at the Battle of Pelennor Fields.\n\nAfter the War of the Ring, Éomer became King and revised the old tradition of the three marshals, giving Erkenbrand the new title of [[Marshal of the West-mark]].<ref name=\":0\">{{UT|11b}}</ref>{{References}}\n\n{{rohirrimranks}}\n\n[[Category:Mannish titles]]\n[[Category:Rohan]]\n[[fi:Markin marsalkka]]"}}}
