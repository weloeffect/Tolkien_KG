We know that Sibthorp sent considerable amounts of plant material to Oxford from the eastern Mediterranean in 1786/87 and that he was in Austria in 1785. He was also in regions of Black Pine growth in 1795 but he died in 1796.|<ref>[https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2014-07-30-botanic-garden-bids-farewell-iconic-black-pine Botanic Garden bids farewell to iconic black pine] at [https://ox.ac.uk/news ox.ac.uk/news]</ref>}}\n\nIf the story of the Black Pine is true then it should be at least 215 years old. \n\nThe tree suffered a collapse on the [[26 July]] [[2014]] <ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYZ_VlXB6pQ Collapse of the Tolkien tree]</ref> and was cut down shortly after due to safety concerns.<ref>[https://vimeo.com/108059963 Tolkien's Tree - the collapse of the black pine at the Oxford Botanic Garden]</ref>\n\nAfter its collapse Dr Harris said:\n{{blockquote|The pine having to be cut down means that we have the opportunity to date the tree precisely and determine whether Sibthorp is likely to have been involved. The particular subspecies of Black Pine represented by the tree has also been a point of controversy - we should now be able to settle this controversy as well.|<ref>[https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2014-07-30-botanic-garden-bids-farewell-iconic-black-pine Botanic Garden bids farewell to iconic black pine] at [https://ox.ac.uk/news ox.ac.uk/news]</ref>}}\n\nTo celebrate its 400th anniversary, the Oxford Botanical Garden is partnering with The Oxford Artisan Distillery to produce Black Pine Whiskey.
