These two ranges lay parallel to the [[Orocarni|Red Mountains]] in the northeast and [[Yellow Mountains]] in the southeast that formed the eastern wall. At their northern end, a narrow gap separated the Blue Mountains from the [[Iron Mountains]], which stretched across the entire north of Middle-earth.<ref>{{SM|4a}}</ref>\n\nSometime during the [[Years of the Trees]] two [[Fathers of the Dwarves|Dwarven Fathers]] awoke under [[Dolmed|Mount Dolmed]] and founded the two westernmost houses of the [[Dwarves]] (the [[Firebeards]] and [[Broadbeams]]). They subsequently built two great city-states, [[Nogrod]] and [[Belegost]].\n\nIn the [[First Age]], the Blue Mountains were an unbroken line separating Eriador from Beleriand. Seven rivers flowed from its western side, and the land these rivers flowed through was known as [[Ossiriand]]. Later, when the [[Green-elves]] settled there, the land was called [[Lindon]], and the mountains sometimes referred to as the ''Ered Lindon''.\nWandering Elves would also hunt in the Blue Mountains.<ref>{{S|10}}</ref>\n\nThe Blue Mountains were ruined during the [[War of Wrath]] at the end of the First Age, and in the south central end of the range the sea broke through. The [[Lhûn|River Lhûn]] now flowed through the mountains to the [[Gulf of Lune]]. On the western side a small section of Lindon remained, and here the retreating [[Elves]] built the kingdom of [[Lindon]], ruled by [[Gil-galad|Ereinion Gil-galad]], last [[High King of the Noldor]].<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref>\n\nThe Dwarven cities of Nogrod and Belegost were also ruined when the mountains were broken, causing most of the Dwarves to migrate east to [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], leaving a remnant behind. However, there remained some Dwarves on the eastern side of the Blue Mountains in days afterwards.<ref>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>\n\n=== Third Age ===\nBy the Third Age, Dwarves dwelt in the east side of the Blue Mountains, especially in the parts south of the [[Gulf of Lhun]].<ref name=\"Eriador\">{{App|Eriador}}</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|1974}}, fleeing the fall of [[Fornost Erain]], [[Arvedui]] briefly hid in old dwarven mines in the far north of the Blue Mountains.<ref name=\"Eriador\">{{App|Eriador}}</ref>\n  \nIt also became the new home for many of [[Durin's Folk]] who were exiled from their halls in [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] by [[Smaug]] the [[Dragons|Dragon]] who had [[Sack of Erebor|driven them out]].  After the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]], King [[Thráin|Thráin II]] established his throne in the Southern range beyond [[the Shire]] ({{TA|2802}})<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> and later his son [[Thorin]] ruled after he went missing. During Thorin's reign, many of the wandering Longbeards joined him in [[Thorin's Halls|his halls]] and they became prosperous in a fashion. However, Erebor was retaken from Smaug by Thorin and company in {{TA|2941}}, and it can be assumed most if not all of Durin's folk relocated there.\n\nHowever the dwarf-mines remained active even by the [[Fourth Age]].<ref name=\"Eriador\">{{App|Eriador}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Ered Luin.mp3|Ardamir}}\n''Ered Luin'' is a [[Sindarin]] name, which means \"Blue Mountains\".<ref>{{PE|17}}, entry S '''Lhûn''', p. 136</ref>\nIt consists of ''[[ered]]'' (\"mountains\")<ref>{{PE|17}}, entry S '''Ered''', p. 33</ref> and ''[[luin]]'' (\"blue\").<ref>{{PE|17}}, entry Q '''luinĭ''', p. 66</ref> \n\n==Other names==\nOther names were '''Ered Lindon''' (\"Mountains of Lindon\")<ref>{{S|Index}}, entry ''Ered Lindon''</ref> and the [[Westron]] name '''Mountains of Lune'''.<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}, p. 4</ref><ref>{{TT|Treebeard}}, p. 468</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Etymologies]]'' show [[Noldorin]] alternative names, ''Lhúnorodrim'' and ''Lhúndirien'' (\"Blue Towers\"), and also the Middle [[Quenya]] ''Lúnoronti'',<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 370</ref> which is first used in a passage of the [[The Fall of Númenor (chapter)#The further development of The Fall of Númenor|further development of The Fall of Númenor]].<ref>{{LR|P1II4}}, p. 30</ref>\n\nIn [[Ælfwine]]'s [[Old English]] translations, the Blue Mountains are named ''Hǽwengebeorg''.<ref>{{SM|7An}}, p. 341</ref>\n\nIn the Second Age the Men of Middle-earth called Ered Luin the '''Western Mountains'''.<ref>{{UT|4a}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''\n:The Blue Mountains are featured as a location of a fight between Dwarves and [[Drogoth]].\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Ered Luin map.jpg|thumb|Map of Ered Luin from ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''.]]\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Blue Mountains appear as the game's westernmost region, Ered Luin. Ered Luin is the beginner's region for four of the game's races: Elves, [[Calaquendi|High Elves]], Dwarves, and \"[[Stout-axe]]\" dwarves. The region's storyline is based around a conflict in the early stages of the [[War of the Ring]] between the allied Elves and Longbeards and a rogue group of Dwarves called the [[Dourhands]] and their allies, the \"Blue Crag\" [[Orcs|Goblins]].\n\n:In addition to the dwarven capital at [[Thorin's Halls|Thorin's Hall]], Ered Luin also contains the city of \"[[Gondamon]]\" in the \"Low Lands\" of the region and the outpost of \"Noglond\" between the two cities. The Elven territory along the shore of the Lhûn is known as \"Falathlorn\", and contains the settlements \"[[Duillond]]\" and \"[[Celondim]]\". The dwarves' port city of \"Kheledûl\" remains under Dourhand control, as does \"Sarnúr\", a recently-unearthed ancient dwarven city. The fortress of \"Orodost\" and the blockaded pass to the [[Grey Havens]], \"Rath Teraig\", are occupied by goblins.\n\n'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''\n:Although the Blue Mountains do not appear in the game, they are mentioned by the Dwarf [[Grof]].
