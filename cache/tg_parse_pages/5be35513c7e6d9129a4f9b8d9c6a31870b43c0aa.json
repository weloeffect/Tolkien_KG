They dwelt mainly in the ancient havens of [[Eglarest]] and [[Brithombar]] of the [[Falas]], and their last home on Middle-earth before finally leaving for the Undying Lands was the [[Grey Havens]]. \n\n==History==\nThe [[Teleri]] were the most numerous Elven clan and for this reason they were led by two brothers, [[Elwë]] and [[Olwë]] in the [[Great Journey]] to [[Aman]]. They were also the most slow and reluctant and many turned back or stayed behind. When Elwë became lost in [[Beleriand]], many of his people refused to carry on until he had been found; those were named [[Eglath]], the forsaken.\n\nIt was Olwë who led the rest to the shores of Beleriand. As they lingered at the [[Bay of Balar]] they were befriended and taught by [[Ulmo]]'s vassal, the [[Maia]] [[Ossë]]. When Ulmo returned with the [[Tol Eressea|floating island]] to take the bulk of the Teleri to the West, Ossë convinced some of them to forsake Valinor and the other Elves and stay behind with him.<ref>{{S|Princes}}</ref> \n\nThese became the Falathrim, and their leader was [[Nowë]],<ref name=\"LastWritingsN\">{{PM|Last}}, \"Círdan\", note 30</ref> kin of both Elwë and Olwë, who stayed behind despite his great eagerness to see the [[light of Valinor]].<ref name=Cirdan>{{PM|Last}}, Círdan</ref> He was later known as Círdan. The Falathrim settled on Beleriand's western shores, building themselves Havens at [[Brithombar]] and [[Eglarest]] and became the first builders and sailors of ships in [[Middle-earth]]'s history. \n\nWhen Elwë returned, he established the Kingdom of [[Doriath]], claiming overlordship of all Beleriand as King Elu Thingol. The Falathrim, along with the Eglath, were considered [[Sindar]], and found many pearls that they sent to him as gifts.<ref>{{S|Sindar}}</ref> \n\nAfter the [[Return of the Noldor]], the Elves of the Falas became fast in friendship with the [[Noldor|Deep Elves]]. Círdan attended the [[Mereth Aderthad]] with many of his people, where he swore oaths of friendship.<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref> With [[Finrod]]'s aid, the Havens of the Falas were strengthened and rebuilt. The Elves of the Havens enjoyed peaceful relations with all the [[Elves of Beleriand]], and were particularly closely allied with the people of [[Nargothrond]]. As one of the most remote peoples from [[Morgoth]]'s forces in [[Angband]], the other Elvish lords would often send their children to the Elves of the Havens for safekeeping.\n\nThey fought beside the [[Noldor]], too: in the [[Second assault on Hithlum]], their mariners rescued High King [[Fingon]] from overwhelming hordes in [[Hithlum]]. After the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], Morgoth sent his hosts to besiege them, and both the Havens were overthrown. Most of the Elves of the Falas perished in the [[fall of the Falas]], or were captured, but Círdan escaped. With his surviving followers and the young [[Gil-galad|Ereinion Gil-galad]], who was at that time lodging with the people of the Havens, he sailed southwards, and settled for a time on the [[Isle of Balar]] maintaining a haven. \n\nAs [[Morgoth]]'s power overwhelmed the Eldar (perhaps soon after the Nirnaeth), some \"seafaring Sindar from the west havens\" fled with 3 small ships to the east. They ended up at the confluence of [[Morthond]] and [[Ringló]]. There they established [[Edhellond]] and were eventually joined by their Telerin kin, [[Silvan Elves]] from the north.<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #67</ref><ref>{{PM|Atani}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[War of Wrath]], Círdan and Gil-galad sailed east to [[Lindon]] where Cirdan founded the [[Grey Havens]] on the newly formed [[Gulf of Lhûn]], and the remnant of the Elves of the Havens must surely have accompanied him.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Falathrim'' is a [[Sindarin]] name, which means \"people of the foaming shore\".<ref name=Cirdan/> It is a combination of the element ''[[falas]]''<ref>{{S|Elements}}, entry ''falas''</ref> (\"beach\", \"shore\", \"strand\", \"surf(line)\") and probably the element ''[[rim]]'' (\"host\", \"great number\", \"people (of one kind or origin)\").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-3766094569.html|articlename=S.
