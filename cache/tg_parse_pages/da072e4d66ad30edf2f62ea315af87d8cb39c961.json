Tolkien]] and [[Richard Wagner]]. It was published as No. 24 in the [[Cormarë Series]].\n\n==From the publisher==\n\n{{blockquote|Tolkien famously rejected comparison of his Ring with Wagner's, though there is good evidence that Tolkien knew much more about ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' than he let on after the publication of ''The Lord of the Rings''. Analysis of that work from a Wagnerian point of view enables consideration of it in a new way. By exploring the parallels between Wagner's Ring and Tolkien's, a fresh interpretation of Tolkien's work emerges, one that hinges on associating [[Gandalf]] with Wotan. Like Wagner's god, Gandalf has to find a way of solving the problems posed by the Ring and like Wotan he cannot succeed without other people. When the plots of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (and ''[[The Hobbit]]'') are examined in this way it becomes apparent how much they owe to Wagner's music-drama, and the role of Gandalf is opened to new explanation.}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.walking-tree.org/books/hobbit_place-names.php Official product page]\n\n{{Cormarë}}\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]"}}}
