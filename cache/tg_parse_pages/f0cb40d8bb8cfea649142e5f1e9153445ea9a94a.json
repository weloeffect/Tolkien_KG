Rose was invented for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power|The Rings of Power]]'' television series by [[Amazon Studios]].\n\n== History ==\nRose was born during the latter half of the [[Second Age]]. She married [[Largo Brandyfoot]] and took on the [[Brandyfoot family|Brandyfoot]] name.\n\nAfter the death of Rose Brandyfoot, her husband, Largo, had \"''felt like the wheels broke out from under''\" him. Largo had believed that after Rose's death, he would never be the same again. While Largo Brandyfoot was eventually able to move on from Rose, it was not until only after he first saw [[Marigold Brandyfoot|Marigold]] within the clearing of the [[Norfield Glen]], that he was finally able to move on from his grief. They had two children together: [[Elanor Brandyfoot|Elanor]] and [[Dilly Brandyfoot|Dilly]].\n\nAfter breaking his left ankle and Marigold grew afraid that that the caravan would be forced to leave them behind on the migration due to the wound. However, Largo attempted to heal her despair by reminding her that she had helped him when he was grieving for Rose Brandyfoot.\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | ROS |~| LAR |y| MAR | | | | |ROS='''ROSE BRANDYFOOT'''<br/><small>''b. {{SA}}-unknown''</small>|LAR=[[Largo Brandyfoot]]<br/><small>''b. {{SA}}''</small>|MAR=[[Marigold Brandyfoot]]<br/><small>''b. {{SA}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | |,|-|^|-|.| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | ELA | | DIL | | | | |ELA=[[Elanor Brandyfoot]]<br/><small>''b. {{SA}}''</small>|DIL=[[Dilly Brandyfoot]]<br/><small>''b. {{SA}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Hobbits from adaptations]]"}}}
