The term ''[[Wiktionary:tater#English|tater]]'' seen to be used in [[Hobbitish]], represents UK slang.\n\nSince the potatoes are a New World plant (see below), it has been suggested that \"potatoes\" is perhaps a \"translation\" from a [[Westron]] name of a related but otherwise unrecorded plant of [[Third Age]] [[Middle-earth]].<ref name=Arda>{{webcite|author=Mark Fisher|articlename=Potatoes|website=EoA|articleurl=http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/p/potatoes.html}}</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nFans have noticed that potatoes are a New World plant, not native to the Old World setting of [[Middle-earth]]. The [[pipe-weed]] (another New World plant) is referenced as having being brought from [[Númenor]] and fans have explored the possibility that this was also the case with potatoes.<ref name=Arda/><ref>[http://www.lotrplaza.com/archives/index.php?Archive=archive&TID=105560 Forum discussion] at LOTRplaza</ref><ref>[http://www.thetolkienforum.com/showthread.php?19248-Taters-in-Middle-Earth&s=cc49b7ac8285e2e4b34e52b0e19be48c Forum discussion] at the TolkienForum</ref> ''[[The Children of Húrin]]'' mentions that the [[Dwarves]] of [[Beleriand]] boiled [[Earth-bread|a white fleshy root]] similar to bread<ref>{{CH|7}}</ref> which could have been another instance of potatoes in Middle-earth, from the [[First Age]].\n\nSee also [[tomatoes]]<ref>{{HM|AH}}</ref> concerning a similar apparent \"paradox\".\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Food]]\n[[Category:Plants]]"}}}
