''Bindbale'').\n\nEven Tolkien himself referred to ''Bindbale'' in a manuscript note when he was preparing the document later known as ''[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings|Nomenclature]]'' (Hammond and Scull suggest that perhaps writing this, Tolkien referred to the printed map and fell victim too of the misprinted ''o''); as a result, in dutch it was translated (after Tolkien's suggestion) as ''Pakkebaal Bos'' which includes ''[[Wiktionary:baal#Dutch|baal]]'' \"b'''a'''le\".<ref name=rc/><ref name=rc>{{HM|RC}}, p. lvii</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\n[[Christopher Tolkien]] would reminisce that there is an actual English place named \"Bindbole Wood\", being one of the real place-names borrowed while drawing ''[[A Part of the Shire]]'' map with his father. However this must be a [[Wikipedia:false memory|false memory]] as there is no trace of such a place, not even Christopher himself was able to find any information afterwards.<ref name=rc/>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Bindbole Wood begins almost immediately north of [[the Hill]] and stretches all the way east to [[Brockenborings]]. [[Overhill]] sits entirely within the Bindbole Wood, on the single road that connects Brockenborings to [[Hobbiton]].\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Forests]]\n[[Category:The Shire]]\n\n[[de:Schiefertonwald]]\n[[fi:Palokorpi]]"}}}
