Toast 'em! Fry 'em! Roast 'em\nTill beards blaze and eyes glaze;\nTill hair swells and skins crack,\nFat melts and bones black\nIn cinders lie beneath the sky!\nSo the Dwarves shall die!  (Ha ha ha...)\n\nFifteen birds in five fir-trees,\nTheir feathers were fanned in a fiery breeze.\nWhat funny little birds - they had no wings.\nOh, what shall we do with the funny little things?\nOh, what shall we do with the funny little things?\n</poem>\n\n[[Category:The Hobbit (1977 film) soundtrack]]"}}}
