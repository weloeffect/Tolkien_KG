Will you risk insanity to stop a Demon's triumph in ''The Terror in the Jungle''? \n\nManari Akajhi, a young scholar, is tracing his family's lineage in search of a suitable resting place for his dead father. Unfortunately, his newly discovered heritage has drawn the powerful Storm King's attention.
