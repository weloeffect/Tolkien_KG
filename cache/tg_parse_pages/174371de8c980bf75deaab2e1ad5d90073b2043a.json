Tolkien''''' is a richly illustrated book written by medievalist Christopher Snyder, published by Sterling Publishing in 2013.\n\n==From the book cover==\n{{blockquote|From the children's book ''[[The Hobbit]]'' to the epic saga ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' — one of the world's most popular literary works; from the Academy Award-winning film adaptations to a popular London stage musical, Middle-earth has captivated generations of readers and fans around the globe. For the first time, medieval scholar Christopher Snyder connects all of the threads of influence on Tolkien that infused his creation of Middle-earth — from ancient Greece and Rome to the languages, poetry, art, and mythology of the medieval cultures beloved by Tolkien; from the battlefields of World War I to the halls of Oxford University.<br/><br/>Snyder also reveals surprisingly pervasive influence of Tolkien's timeless fantasies on modern culture, from 1960s counterculture to film, the fantasy publishing and gaming industries, role-playing, music, environmentalism, and Internet fandom.<br/><br/>Richly illustrated with maps, art, and photographs; and covering a wide range of Tolkien writings — including ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[The Children of Húrin]]'', and important essays and poems — ''The Making of Middle-earth'' is the most in-depth exploration perhaps ever undertaken of Tolkien's world and influences.}}\n\n==From the publisher==\n:This informational book deals with Tolkien's scholarly and writing life, the mythical and medieval influences on his works, and his legacy. . .  . The book itself is a visual delight, from its medieval-door-photo endpapers to its textured sepia pages, several laced with lined designs on the wide margins.. . . Several framed sidebars provide fun facts. Most of the double-page layouts include an image (all of which are captioned and cited at the end of the book). . . . this volume gives readers plenty of interesting details and fills a nice niche by combining author, source, and literary discussions without being neither too scholarly or too commercial. — ''Booklist'' <ref name=\"test\">[http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-making-of-middle-earth-christopher-snyder/1112540005#productInfoTabs The Making of Middle-earth: A New Look Inside the World of J. R. R. Tolkien, Barnes & Noble], (accessed 23 February 2017).</ref>\n\n:As Christopher Snyder's ''The Making of Middle-earth: A New Look Inside the World of J.R.R. Tolkien'' makes clear, Tolkien cleverly adapted ideas, characters, and themes from myriad source materials. . . . [I]n Snyder's readable study we see how Tolkien was changed by his literary forebears, which inspired him to create his own 'legendarium.' . . . [Snyder] adds an important voice to the growing body of Tolkien scholarship for laypeople and provides a lightning quick overview of Tolkien's life, academic trajectory, and literary interests in a highly readable style. Colorful sidebars and archival illustrations bring the history alive, and the look and feel are appropriately medieval. . . . Comprehensive footnotes, appendices, and other resources are there for more in-depth exploration. — ''Boston Globe''<ref name=\"test\" />\n\n{{References}}\n{{title|italics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Making of Middle-earth, The}}\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]"}}}
