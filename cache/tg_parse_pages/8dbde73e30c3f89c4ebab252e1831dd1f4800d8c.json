But the story is timeless, the themes that it touches on are contained in cultures all around the world. The innocent on a quest, the pretender, an inanimate object that holds evil - it's really strange that these themes are there in so many different countries' folklore.|Billy Boyd, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2002/12/14/billy_boyd_two_towers_interview.shtml BBC]}}\n\n{{Quote|I think his part in the story – as well as reminding people that the hobbits are basically fun at the core and are good, good people – his story is about maturing, and a young man in war and how he deals with those horrors.
