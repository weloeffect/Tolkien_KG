[[Dorlas]] stepped forward immediately, but when no one else volunteered, he upbraided the lot of them, asking if none would take the place of Brandir so that the House of Haleth would not be put to shame. Hunthor, kinsman to Brandir, rebuked Dorlas since Brandir's lameness was due to ill chance. Hunthor then said he would go on behalf of Haleth's house.\n\nHunthor and Dorlas went with Túrin to [[Nen Girith]], where Túrin revealed his plan to climb down the [[Ravines of Taeglin]], cross the river, and ascend the other side so as to strike Glaurung's belly as he stretched across the gap.<ref>{{CH|16}}</ref> Dorlas, who had deprecated the other Men of Brethil for lacking courage, could not bring himself to attempt to cross the rock-filled waters. Thus, only Túrin and Hunthor clambered up the west side of the ravine to make their attack.\n\nTúrin and Hunthor were nearing the belly of the beast when the heat and stench of the dragon nearly caused Túrin to fall into the river, but Hunthor seized him and saved his life. Túrin proclaimed Hunthor to be of \"Great Heart!\" but even at the moment a stone struck Hunthor's head and he was lost in the [[Taeglin]].<ref>{{CH|17}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Hunthor'' is given no definition. In [[The Etymologies]], the similar name ''Hundor'' was derived from the [[Noldorin]] element \"hûn\" (\"heart\", as in the physical organ).<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}</ref> The element \"thor\" may be [[Nandorin]], as seen in ''[[Denethor (king of the Laiquendi)|Denethor]]''.\n\n==Genealogy==\nIn ''[[The Children of Húrin]]'' all that was said of Hunthor's family was that he was a kinsman of Brandir the Lame and thus a member of the House of Haleth.<ref>{{CH|16}}, p. 227</ref>  In \"[[The Wanderings of Húrin]]\", a story that appeared in ''[[The War of the Jewels]]'', Part Three (subtitled \"Other Writings Not Forming Part of the ''Quenta Silmarillion''\"), the relationship of Hunthor to Brandir (and other details of his family) was made clear.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, p. 270</ref>  Women in the family tree are indicated by ''italic'' text. The dagger symbol (†) shows those who died early (and childless) deaths (which indicates the ending of the House of Haleth).\n\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | HMR | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |HMR=[[Halmir]]}}\n{{familytree | |,|-|-|-|v|-|^|-|v|-|-|-|.| | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | HDR | | HUN | | HAR | | HIR | | | | | | | | |HDR=[[Haldir (Chieftain of the Haladin)|Haldir]]|HUN=[[Hundar]]|HAR=''[[Hareth]]''|HIR=''[[Hiril]]''}}\n{{familytree | |!| | | |!| | | |!| | | |!| | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | HAN | | HUN | | HUR | | MEL |~|~|y|~|~| AGA |HAN=[[Handir]]|HUN=[[Hundad]]|HUR=[[Húrin]]|MEL=''[[Meleth]]''|AGA=[[Agathor]]}}\n{{familytree | |!| | | |!| | | |!| | | |,|-|-|-|^|-|-|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree | BRA | | HDG | | TUR | | HTH |~| WIF | | MAN |BRA=[[Brandir]]<br/>the Lame †|HDG=[[Hardang]] †|TUR=[[Túrin]] †|HTH='''HUNTHOR''' †|WIF=''Unnamed<br/>Wife''|MAN=[[Manthor]] †}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn ''[[The Quenta]]'', when Turambar seeks to confront Glómund, he is initially joined by six of his boldest men, but in the night they all slunk away in fear at the rumour of the dragon's arrival, leaving Turambar to confront it alone.<ref>{{SM|Q13}}</ref> In one earlier version of ''[[The Grey Annals]]'', ''''''Albarth'''''', changed from '''''Albard''''', was one of Túrin's six companions along with Dorlas. After crossing the Taiglin, Túrin noted that three of his companions were missing and was informed that Albarth fell and was swept away by the Taiglin, while the other two had likely been daunted and slunk away. After emending the tale closer to the final version, where Albarth becomes the one companion who remains with Túrin, his name is changed to '''''Torbarth''''' before becoming ''Hunthor''; in one instance, however, ''Torbarth'' was pencilled over with '''''Gwerin'''''.<ref name=ga_comment>{{WJ|P1c}}</ref>{{rp|§§322–5}}\n\n''Gwerin'' is an early [[Noldorin]] name (precursor of [[Sindarin]] ''[[cerin]]'')<ref>{{HM|UI}}, p. 309 (first paragraph of the entry for \"Cerin Amroth . . . the heart of the ancient realm as it was long ago\")</ref> meaning \"enclosure\".<ref>{{PE|13}}, p. 146</ref> In his initial genealogy, Hunthor was the son of [[Hundad]] and brother of ''Harathor'' ([[Hardang]]).<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Characters in The Children of Húrin]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:Edain]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Halethian names]]\n[[Category:House of Haleth]]"}}}
