He was a [[Rangers of the North|Ranger of the North]] and part of [[Aragorn]]'s company that helped protect the Hobbits in the Shire and Bree-land during the dawn of the [[War of the Ring]]. He managed to free [[Mundo Sackville-Baggins]] from the [[Blackwolds|Blackwold]] and a [[Nazgûl|Black Rider]]. Yet, the [[Nazgûl]] stabbed him with his dagger before riding off. Gravely poisoned, he sought refuge in [[Archet]].<ref>{{VGC|SAIB}}</ref> \n\nPerhaps due to the poisoned blade, he joined the forces of Angmar. The [[Nazgûl]] that stabbed him along with four others attempted to change him into a [[wraiths|wraith]] but [[Aragorn]], [[Lenglinn]] and [[Torthann]] are able to drive them off. Amdir was slain by the [[Free peoples]] of [[Middle-earth]] before the change was completed.<ref>{{VGC|SAI}} Chapter 1: Unravelling the Thread</ref>\n{{references}}\n{{title}}\n[[Category:Men from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings Online characters]]"}}}
