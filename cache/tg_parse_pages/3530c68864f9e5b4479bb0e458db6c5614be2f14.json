The Hobbits had an extensive agricultural system in the Shire, but did not proceed with industrialisation. Various supplies could be found in the Shire, including cereals, fruit, wood and [[pipe-weed]] (a favourite treat of Hobbits).\n\nThe Shire was quite densely populated in parts with many villages and a few towns, but it still was open enough to allow for wide forested areas and marshes. There were green, rolling hills and freshly tilled earth, along with gardens and flower boxes on window sills.\n\nThanks to the protective presence of the [[Rangers of the North]] in the lands of the former Arnor, the Shire for centuries ignored the wide world outside, despite being traversed by the [[East Road]].\n\nFrom the west to the east, the Shire originally measured 40 leagues (120 miles) from the [[Far Downs]] to the [[Brandywine Bridge]]. From the north to the south, it measured 50 leagues (150 miles) from the [[North Moors|northern moors]] to the [[marshes in the south]].<ref name=\"FRHobbits\" /> The total area of the Shire must have extended roughly about 20,000 square miles.<ref group=\"note\">[[Robert Foster]] estimates the total area of the Shire to be \"about 18,000 square miles\"; [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] has calculated a larger figure, about 21,400 square miles. See: {{HM|Guide}}, entry \"Shire\" and {{HM|AME}}, revised edn (London: HarperCollins, 1991), p. 69</ref>\n\nIn {{SR|1452}}, [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] gave the [[Westmarch]] to the [[Shire-hobbits]] as a gift. This extended the western boundaries of the Shire to the [[Tower Hills]].<ref name=\"AppB5\" /> [[Buckland]], to the east of the Brandywine, remained an independent region occupied by [[Hobbits]].\n\n[[File:Christopher Tolkien - A Part of the Shire.jpg|thumb|500px|center|''[[A Part of the Shire]]'' by [[Christopher Tolkien]]]]\n\nThe boundaries of the Shire were as follows:<ref name=\"FRHobbits\" />\n\n{{navigation\n| title=Boundaries of the Shire\n| north-west=\n| north=[[North Moors]]\n| north-east=Possibly [[Dwaling]]\n| west=[[Tower Hills]]\n| east=[[Baranduin|Brandywine River]]\n| south-west=\n| south=[[Marshes in the south]]\n| south-east=Possibly [[Sarn Ford]]\n}}\n\n==History==\n<!--\"See also\" in Eriador#Foundation of the Shire links here-->\n{{Quote|But it is not your own Shire. Others dwelt here before hobbits were; and others will dwell here again when hobbits are no more. The wide world is all about you: you can fence yourselves in, but you cannot for ever fence it out.|[[Gildor Inglorion]] in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', \"[[Three is Company]]\"}}\nThe Shire was a fertile and well-tilled part of [[Arnor]], with many royal farms, [[corn]]lands, vineyards, and woods. It had long been deserted during the waning days of the Kingdom when it was known as the splinter-realm of [[Arthedain]];<ref name=\"FRHobbits\" /> it had been the hunting grounds of the [[King of Arnor]].<ref>{{PM|Prologue}}, p.9</ref> The [[Hobbits]] from [[Bree]] got official permission from King [[Argeleb II]] at Norbury ([[Fornost]]) to settle the lands. This was finally done in {{TA|1601}} (Year 1 in [[Shire Reckoning]]) by Hobbits from [[Bree]], led by the brothers [[Marcho]] and [[Blanco]].<ref name=\"FRHobbits\" /> They were joined by other hobbits who lived in [[Dunland]] and parts of depopulated [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]].\n\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - One Morning Long Ago.jpg|thumb|left|''One Morning Long Ago'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nBy 30 years later, almost all of the Hobbits of Middle-earth could be found in the Shire. The [[Shire-hobbits]] considered themselves as subjects of the [[Kings of Arthedain|King]], at least nominally, considering the isolation of their country. Nevertheless the Hobbits sent some support troops to the great battles Arnor fought against [[Angmar]]. After the fall of Arnor, the Shire remained a minor but independent political unit and the title of [[Thain]] was established to fill the absence of a Kingship.<ref name=\"FRHobbits\" />\n\nIts small size, relative lack of importance, and brave and resilient Hobbit population made it too modest an objective for conquest. More important was that the Shire was guarded and protected by the [[Dúnedain]] [[Rangers of the North]] (and [[Gandalf]]), who watched the borders and kept out intruders. The only strangers to enter the Shire were the [[Dwarves]] travelling on the [[East Road]] that ran through the Shire to and from their mines in the [[Blue Mountains]], and the occasional [[Elves]] on their way to the [[Emyn Beraid]] or the [[Grey Havens]].\n\nIn {{TA|2340}}, the [[Oldbucks]] of the [[Marish]] crossed the [[Brandywine]] because of overpopulation and founded [[Buckland]].\n\nHowever, the Shire faced its adversities since it was inside the range of the [[Great Plague]] of {{TA|1636}}, and [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains|Goblins]] from [[Mount Gram]] invaded the Shire until they were driven out after the [[Battle of Greenfields]] ({{TA|2747}}). The Shire also suffered because of the [[Long Winter]] ({{TA|2758}}) soon followed by the [[Days of Dearth]] ({{TA|2760}}) and the [[Fell Winter (Third Age)|Fell Winter]] ({{TA|2911}}) when [[White Wolves]] entered the Shire.<ref name=\"AppB2\" />\n\n[[Saruman]] followed Gandalf's interest for the Hobbits and put spies in Bree and Southfarthing. In the years leading up to the [[War of the Ring]], his spies saw that the Shire was closely guarded by the Rangers. When Gandalf suspected that Bilbo Baggins possessed the [[One Ring]] the guard was doubled<ref name=\"AppB2\" /> (perhaps at his request to [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain|Chieftain]] [[Aragorn]]).\n\n===War of the Ring===\nDuring the [[War of the Ring]], the Shire was first visited by the Nine [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]] when the Rangers were off to the War. This left the Shire defenseless, leaving it open to be captured by Sharkey (Alias of Saruman) and some [[Ruffians]], through the use of [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]]. It was liberated after [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] returned from Gondor. Their victory at the [[Battle of Bywater]] and the death of Saruman put a final end to the War.\n\nYet the physical damage which Saruman caused by forced industrialisation was undone by the Hobbits' efforts and the soil from [[Lothlórien]] (given to Sam by [[Galadriel]]) and {{TA|3021}} was considered to be the most productive and prosperous year in their history.\n\n===Fourth Age===\nWith [[Aragorn]]'s return as the King of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]], the Shire joined the [[Reunited Kingdom]]<ref>{{FR|Records}}</ref> and in {{FoA|6}} became a Free Land, protected enclave inside the Kingdom; a royal order forbade the entrance of any one other than [[Hobbits]] into the Shire. In {{FoA|31}}, King Aragorn extended the land westwards to [[Emyn Beraid]]; this land was named [[Westmarch]] and many hobbits relocated there.<ref>{{App|Later}}</ref>\n\n==Administration==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring - The Shire.jpg|250px|left|thumb|The Shire in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'']]\nAt its founding, the Shire was a part of Arthedain and the Hobbits considered themselves to be subjects of the King. It was only after the fall of Arthedain that the Shire became an independent state. Once independent, the Hobbits of the Shire selected a '''[[Thain]]''' to lead them. The office of Thain was hereditary, initially belonging to the [[Oldbuck Family|Oldbuck]] family. When the Oldbucks left the Shire for [[Buckland]], the office passed to the [[Took Family|Took]] family of [[Tuckborough]]. While nominally the Thain ruled over the four [[Farthings]], in practice authority was so decentralised that the title was seen as more of a formality and ceremonial.\n\nThe Shire was originally divided into four [[Farthings]] ([[Northfarthing]], [[Southfarthing]], [[Eastfarthing]], and [[Westfarthing]]). Within the Farthings there were smaller, unofficial divisions, such as towns or regions associated with particular families. The [[Took Family|Tooks]], for instance, mostly lived in or near [[Tuckborough]]. In many cases, Hobbit family names were derived from their places of origin. For example, [[Samwise Gamgee]]'s surname was derived from the town of [[Gamwich]] whence the family originated. \n\nThe only elected official of the Shire was the '''[[Mayor of Michel Delving]]''' in the [[White Downs]] (by extension seen as the mayor of the Shire). The Mayor's chief duties were serving as postmaster of the Shire's [[Messenger Service]], charging the [[Watch]], and presiding at fairs.\n\nThe sole law enforcement officials in the Shire were the [[Shirriffs]]. Their primary responsibility was the protection of the Shire from trespassers. There were three in each Farthing and were distinguished from \"civilians\" by a feather worn in their caps. The [[Bounders]] were the land's border-guard, charged with turning back unwanted people or beasts; their number varied according to need.\n\nAfter [[Westmarch]] was added to the Shire, the Thain established the title of [[Warden of Westmarch]]. This was a hereditary office with unclear responsibilities. It was first given to the [[Fairbairn family|Fairbairns]], descendants of Samwise Gamgee. \n\nBuckland, which was not part of the Shire proper, was controlled by the '''[[Master of Buckland]]''' at [[Bucklebury]]. The office of Master was established by the Oldbucks when they left the Shire. Their descendants continued to hold the office when they became the [[Brandybuck Family|Brandybucks]].\n\n==Etymology==\nA \"shire\" ([[Old English]] ''scír'') is an organised region with a county town, which in the case of the Hobbits' Shire was [[Michel Delving]].<ref name=\"Nomen\" /> [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] notes that the usual Germanic word for \"district\", represented in Dutch by ''gouw'' and in German by ''Gau'', was replaced in English by ''scír'' at an early date.

Tolkien]] interview to John Ezard<ref>''[[Oxford Mail]]'', [[3 August]] [[1966]], p. 4</ref>}}\nOn Tolkien's maps, the Shire is located at about the same position as England is on modern European maps and has been cited as an example of [[Wikipedia:Deep England|Deep England]] ideology (though, of course, England is on an island while the Shire is a landlocked country). Throughout the narrative, Tolkien also implies numerous points of similarity between the two, such as weather, agriculture and dialect. One can also see England as Tolkien's source of inspiration for the Shire in its very name. Tolkien had spent his youth in [[Sarehole]], Worcestershire.\n\nAccording to [[Paula Marmor]], the hobbit brothers [[Marcho]] and [[Blanco]] bear names related to horses, parallel to [[Hengest]] and [[Horsa]], the [[Wikipedia:Hengest and Horsa|legendary leaders]] who brought the Saxons to Britain. Hengest was the founder of [[Wikipedia:Kent|Kent]] whose geography is similar to the Shire (North Downs above, hills to the west, water to the east and marshes to the southeast).<ref>{{HM|IE}}, \"An etymological excursion among the Shire-Folk\" by [[Paula Marmor]]</ref>\n\nThe industrialisation of the Shire was based on Tolkien's witnessing of the extension of the Industrial Revolution to rural Warwickshire during his youth, and especially the deleterious consequences thereof. The rebellion of the hobbits and the restoration of the pre-industrial Shire may be interpreted as a prescription of voluntary simplicity as a remedy to the problems of modern society.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Pictures of the Shire in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring - Hobbiton.jpg|The Shire in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - The Shire map.jpg|Map of the Shire from ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - The Yondershire map.jpg|Map of the \"Yondershire\" from ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n\n===Films===\n'''1977: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''\n:The Shire is featured in the opening and last scenes of the film.

Also, part of the [[Northfarthing]] is placed within the borders of [[Evendim]] region for gameplay purposes. The Shire is inhabited by hundreds of non-playable characters, involved in hundreds of quests.\n\n:In 2022 an extension to the region called \"[[the Yondershire]]\" was added. This area includes the Shire's less-tamed north-western reaches and the surrounding territory, reaching to the [[Lhûn|River Lune]] in the west and the [[Hills of Evendim]] in the north. It encompasses the rest of the Northfarthing, and most of the Westfarthing that wasn't yet in the game.
