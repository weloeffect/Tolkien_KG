Sambrog was invented by [[Standing Stone Games]] for ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''.\n\n== History ==\nDuring the player character's pursuit of the [[Witch-king]] within [[Othrongroth]], they ended up entering a vast throne room with Sambrog the [[Barrow-wights|Wight-lord]] sitting on a great throne. Sambrog greets and bids the player character to approach. Upon announcing that the Witch-king sends his regards, Sambrog grants the player character an audience to provide the information about the intentions of the Witch-king, but he also reveals that he believes that the player would not leave Othrongroth alive to spoil anything.\n\nSambrog reveals a great deal to the player cryptically, saying that while his [[Witch-king|Master]] seeks a power for [[Sauron]], other plans are at play: the [[Skorgrím Dourhand|Pale Dwarf]] would build an army in the name of [[Angmar]] as the gaunt one was sent to Agamaur in the [[Lone-lands|east]] in order to awaken a Power sleeping within the waters.\n\nWith that said, Sambrog ends his audience with the player character, announcing that death waits for them and that he cannot be defeated.\n\nDuring the fight, Sambrog summons [[Wraiths|Fell-spirits]], who move to heal him.\n\nEventually, [[Tom Bombadil]] shows up and sings a song which kills Sambrog. Afterwards, Bombadil cleanses Othrongroth before taking the player character out of the Great Barrow.<ref>{{VGC|SAI}}, Chapter 11: \"Othrongroth\"</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings Online characters]]\n[[Category:Undead from adaptations]]"}}}
