It preferred southern climates and grew abundantly in [[Gondor]]. In northern regions, like [[Eriador]], it was not as rich and large, and was never found in the wild; it flourished only in warm sheltered places like the southern slopes of the [[Bree-hill]], or [[Longbottom]] in [[the Shire]].<ref name=\"pipeweed\">{{FR|Pipeweed}}, p. 8</ref>\n==History==\nThe plant was probably native to [[Númenor]], and was brought to [[Middle-earth]] by the [[Númenóreans]] during the [[Second Age]].<ref name=\"pipeweed\" /> It grew in [[Gondor]] as a wild herb, appreciated primarily for its fragrant blossoms, where it was known as '''''sweet galenas''''' or more popularly as '''''westmansweed'''''.<ref name=\"healing\">{{RK|V8}}</ref>\n\nPipe-weed reached [[Eriador]] by the [[Greenway]] some time in the [[Third Age]].<ref>{{FR|Pipeweed}}, p. 9</ref> The [[Bree-hobbits]] were the first to put it in pipes and use it for [[smoking]], but the first \"true\" pipe-weed was grown by [[Tobold Hornblower]] of [[Longbottom]] in the [[Southfarthing]] around {{SR|1070}}. The art of smoking pipe-weed spread from [[Bree]] to [[Men]], [[Dwarves]] and others who wandered through the crossroads by Bree. [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] therefore considered ''[[The Prancing Pony]]'' as the \"home and centre\" of the smoking art.<ref name=\"pipeweed\" /> \n\nThe [[Wizards|Wizard]] [[Gandalf]] learned to smoke pipe-weed from the Hobbits and was often seen blowing smoke-rings.<ref name=\"pipeweed\" /> [[Saruman]] initially derided him for this, but at some point he took up smoking himself, and even had commerce with the Shire; after the destruction of [[Isengard]], pipe-weed was found among its stores, but the Hobbits [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] failed to realize the [[Sharkey|sinister implications]].\n\nThe cultivation and exportation of this herb became a key industry in the Shire, especially in the south. Popular varieties of pipe-weed from the Shire included [[Longbottom Leaf]], [[Old Toby]], and [[Southern Star]].<ref name=\"pipeweed\" /> Perhaps less popular was [[Southlinch]] from Bree.<ref>{{RK|VI7}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[War of the Ring]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] authored ''[[Herblore of the Shire]]'' discussing the origins and history of the Hobbits' 'art' of [[smoking]] pipe-weed.<ref name=\"pipeweed\" />\n\n==Inspiration==\nIn the prologue to ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Tolkien stated specifically that it is \"a variety probably of ''Nicotiana''\",<ref name=\"pipeweed\" /> i.e. tobacco.\n\n==Other names==\nThe common Gondorian name of pipe-weed was '''<u>''westmansweed''</u>'''.<ref>{{RK|Houses}}</ref> The more noble name was '''''galenas''''' (a [[Númenórean Sindarin]] form of the proper [[Sindarin]] form ''galanes''), with [[Quenya]] forms '''''alanessë''''' or '''''alenessë''''' derived from [[GALA|ala-]] (\"plant, grow\") and ''nes-'' (\"sweet smelling\").<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 100</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[Image:Item-Sweet Galenas.jpg|thumb|250px|Sweet Galenas in [[The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar]]]]\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The smoke from Sweet Galenas takes the form of a sailing ship that floats out from the pipe.\n'''2014: ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]] (Game of the Year Edition)'':'''\n:The plant is used for healing Tallion, as well as other plants.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Pipe-weed| ]]\n[[de:Pfeifenkraut]]\n[[fr:essais/divers/herbe a pipe]]\n[[fi:Piippukessu]]"}}}
