This scene was not featured in the theatrical release of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''.\n\n==Synopsis==\nAs [[Faramir]] holds the cloven [[Horn of Gondor]], he recalls the last time he saw his brother, [[Boromir]] — the day [[Osgiliath]] was reclaimed from the forces of [[Mordor]] for [[Gondor]]. \n\nOn that day, a charismatic Boromir gives an impassioned speech, saying that no part of Gondor will fall into enemy hands again. Faramir finds him afterwards, and the two brothers toast the day, with Boromir saying ''\"Remember today little brother. Today, life is good.\"'' Faramir sees their father, [[Denethor]], approaching, who praises Boromir and criticises Faramir's attempts to retain control of the city. Boromir is disgruntled at Denethor’s treatment of Faramir, but Denethor brushes the issue aside and speaks in private with his eldest son. He asks Boromir to go to [[Rivendell]], where [[Elrond]] has called a meeting. He perceives that the [[One Ring]] has been found and that other races will try to claim it. However, he tells Boromir the ring must be brought to Gondor to give their people power in the struggle against [[Sauron]]. Boromir refuses, saying his place is \"here with my people, not in Rivendell\". Faramir hears the end of this and offers to go to Rivendell instead. Denethor discerns that Faramir wishes to show his quality and refuses, saying he only trusts Boromir with this, as he knows he will not fail him. \n\nAs Boromir is mounted and ready to leave for Rivendell, he says to Faramir ''\"Remember today, little brother.\"'' Faramir watches him in silence as he rides off. \n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers scenes|41]]"}}}
