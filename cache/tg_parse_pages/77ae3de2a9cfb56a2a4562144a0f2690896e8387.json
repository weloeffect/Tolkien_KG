Indeed it was believed among the Dwarves that he was the reincarnation of Durin I, though whether this is possible is unclear.<ref name=\"Durin\"/>\n\nNear the end of Durin VI's reign, the Dwarves, mining for ''[[mithril]]'',  encountered a [[Balrogs|Balrog]] that had hidden itself deep beneath the city. The monster began to wreak havoc on Khazad-dûm and slew Durin. Since the surviving Dwarves were unsure what type of monster they faced, the Balrog was simply called \"[[Durin's Bane]]\". Durin's son [[Náin I]] was slain shortly thereafter, leaving his grandson [[Thráin I]] to lead Durin's folk as the survivors fled from their ancestral home.<ref name=\"Durin\">{{App|Durin}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nOne account states that the name ''Durin ''was a word for \"king\" in the language of the [[Men of the North]] in the early [[Second Age]].<ref name=relations>{{PM|Relations}}</ref> \n\nAnother account states that ''Durinn'' is one of the Dwarfs in the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. The name means \"Sleepy\".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, \"Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion\", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| DU1 | |DU1=[[Durin|Durin I]]<br /><small>''fl.
