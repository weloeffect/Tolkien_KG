This scene was not featured in the theatrical release of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Merry]] awakes in a glade in [[Fangorn Forest]]. The morning light shines through the trees as he sees [[Pippin]], who is already awake, drinking [[Ent-draught|water]] nearby. As Merry searches for [[Treebeard]], Pippin tells him of the ''lovely dream'' he had during the night in which they shared a large barrel of [[pipe-weed]]. Pippin then relaxes, but Merry begins to hear noises that sound \"[[Entish]]\". He slowly realises they appear to be coming from Pippin! In disbelief, Merry realises that Pippin is taller than he was; he quickly takes the water Pippin was drinking, thinking it to be the cause of the strange happenings, for himself. The younger hobbit chases Merry in an attempt to take the water back, but they both get caught in a tree which begins to move and trap their limbs. Treebeard arrives and soothes the tree, rescuing Merry and Pippin.\n\n==Differences==\nIn this scene, Merry and Pippin get trapped in the grip of a waking tree. A very similar event occurs in the book chapter [[The Old Forest]], where [[Old Man Willow]] trapped Merry and Pippin. [[Frodo]] and [[Sam]] cried for help from [[Tom Bombadil]] who chastised the tree, freeing the two trapped hobbits.<ref>{{FR|Forest}}, pp. 116-20</ref> The dialogue spoken by Treebeard towards the end of this scene is taken from this event in the book.<ref>{{FR|Forest}}, p. 120</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers scenes|19]]"}}}
