His great work the ''[[Yénonótië]]'' was cited by [[Pengolodh]] in the ''[[The Annals of Aman|Annals of Aman]]'', particularly his writing explaining the length of the [[Valian year]] and its relation to the waxing and waning of the [[Two Trees]]. Quennar also calculated the duration of Valian years compared to the [[coranar|solar years]].<ref>{{WJ|V}}</ref> \n\nQuennar was known to have resided in [[Tirion]] at the time when both [[Vanyar]] and [[Noldor]] resided there, at which time he devised the word ''[[Menel]]'' (\"heavens, firmament\").<ref>{{PE|21}}, p. 84</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Quennar'' consists of the [[Quenya]] word for 'person', 'elf': ''[[quen]]'', and a derivative of the root NAR<sup>2</sup> 'tell',<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}</ref> yielding the meaning *\"Elf-speaker\". \n\n''i'' is the article 'the'. {{PE|22}}{{rp|147}}\n\n''Onótimo'' apparently means \"Reckoner\", originating from the verb ''[[onot-]]'' 'count up' and the masculine agental suffix ''[[-mo]]''.<ref>{{VT|34}}</ref>\n\nThus his full title appears to be \"Quennar the Reckoner\".\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nOriginally, \"Quennar i Onótimo\" was to have been the author of the ''Annals of Aman'' as a whole, having learned and borrowed much writing from [[Rúmil (elf of Tirion)|Rúmil]]. Eventually, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] attributed the ''Annals'' to Rúmil himself, while adding \"quoth Pengolodh\" to the end of the section ascribed to Quennar. This probably means that Pengolodh quoted Quennar's work in his enlargement of the ''Annals'', which presumably took place after the [[Exile of the Noldor]]. Since Quennar's writing discusses the [[Years of the Sun]], which did not exist while the [[Noldor]] still lived in Aman, it is most likely the case that in the final version of events as envisioned by Tolkien, Quennar wrote the ''[[Yénonótië]]'' after the Exile and was thus a Noldo who came to [[Middle-earth]].\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Calaquendi]]\n[[Category:Chroniclers of Arda]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Noldor]]\n[[Category:Quenya names]]\n[[fi:Quennar Onótimo]]"}}}
