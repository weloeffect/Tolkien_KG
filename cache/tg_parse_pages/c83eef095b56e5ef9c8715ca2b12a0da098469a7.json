It has 30 minutes of additional footage added back into the film (bringing its total running time up to 208 minutes), as well as multiple documentaries about the making of the film as supplements. \n\nThis edition was brought from the success of the theatrical cut of the film,  and it was released on DVD [[12 November|November 12]], [[2002]] along with four commentaries and hours of supplementary material. It was so successful that the sequels were each given similar releases. Its main feature is that, instead of simply inserting the deleted scenes, [[Peter Jackson]] approached this edition as if he were creating a whole new version of the film. He and the editor, John Gilbert, evaluated the unreleased material and worked to bring it up to the same polish as the rest of the feature. Visual effects were completed, dialogue was recordered, sound effects were created and, to make sure all of the scenes flowed, [[Howard Shore]] composed and recorded new score along with the London Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n==Special Extended Edition - Part One (disc 1)==\nThe first disc contains the extended version of the film with the following audio commentaries:\n* [[Peter Jackson]], [[Fran Walsh]], and [[Philippa Boyens]]\n* The Design Team\n* The Production and Post-Production Team\n* The Cast\n\n===New Scenes===\n* 2.
