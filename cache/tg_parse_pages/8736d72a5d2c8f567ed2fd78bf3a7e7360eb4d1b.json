Tharzog was invented by [[Warner Bros.]] for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'', where he was portrayed by an unknown actor.<ref name=\"Citadeltower\">[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Citadel Tower''</ref>\n\n== History ==\nTharzog was an [[Orcs|Orc]] chieftain from Mount Gram that came to serve [[Agandaûr]]. In Fornost, Tharzog commanded the assembled host of Orcs and Goblins, preparing for Agandaûr's conquest of the North of [[Middle-earth]].<ref name=\"backstory\">{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.warinthenorth.com/index.php/the-game/enemies|articlename=Enemies|dated=|website=warinthenorth.com|accessed=22 February 2012}}</ref> When [[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]], [[Andriel]], [[Farin (video game character)|Farin]], [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]] infiltrated Fornost, Tharzog told Agandaûr that there were intruders and that [[Beleram]] - a captured [[Eagles|Eagle]] - had been freed. Mocked for his troops' poor ability to stop the enemy, Tharzog sent his lieutenants to call the guard. He noticed the intruders trying to sneak into the Citadel tower, after which he ordered the closing the gate to the top of the tower. This separated Eradan, Andriel and Farin from Elladan and Elrohir. The latter confronted Agandaûr, while Tharzog and his guard fought the former. Despite his brute strength, Tharzog was slain and his guard was slaughtered.<ref name=\"Citadeltower\"/>\n\n== Personality ==\nLike many other Orcs and Goblins residing in Fornost, Tharzog was very fearful of Agandaûr, shown by how uncomfortable he felt in the latter's presence and how he genuinely studdered when reporting the presence of intruders. He was both very strong and quick, and was therefore the most feared - with the sole exception of Agandaûr - of all the fell creatures in Fornost.<ref name=\"backstory\"/>\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Orcs from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: War in the North characters]]"}}}
