According to an ancient custom, a hobbit baby, shortly after birth and its name-announcement, was given a gift by the head of the family, as a token of accepting it into the family (on the rare cases of adoptions, parents gave gifts to their new child). Gifts then became a means of recognizing family membership, and the head of the family ritually gave something, even if only a token, to a birthday celebrant.\n\nOn its third birthday, a ''ribadyan'' hobbit child gave presents to their parents, that typically was something that was personally found, or produced (made or grown). This may have been extended to other ages and relatives, and began the custom of the ''ribadyan'' also ''giving'' something to the persons of their environment along with the older and most formalized custom of ''receiving''.\n\nThe present given by the ''ribadyan'' was typically something owned or produced by themselves; as a rule something not very expensive,<ref name=letter/><ref name=party/> (such as circulating ''[[mathom]]s''<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>) but its nature depended on time, places, the age and status of the celebrant.<ref name=letter/> One notable exception was [[Bilbo Baggins]] who didn't circulate gifts; he kept those given, and instead gave new ones. For his [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|Farewell Party]], he had ordered especially good gifts and \"[[magic]]al\" [[Dwarves|dwarven]] toys, ordered from [[Erebor]] and [[Dale]].<ref name=party/>\n\nThe ''ribadyan'' who was head of a [[Shire]] house would distribute gifts to all residents, servants, neighbors and others; and commonly giving a party, distributing presents to all invited. Among the [[Shire-hobbits]] of the later [[Third Age]], the recipients included near kin and neighbors (\"twelve-mile cousins\"). Withholding an expected gift was taken as a rebuke. The giving was made in person and privately, avoiding embarassments; properly before the birthday, the latest being the nuncheon on the birthday.<ref name=letter/>\n\nBirthdays were very frequent in places such as [[Hobbiton]] and [[Bywater]], because of their population: some hobbit would have a birthday each day in the [[coranar|year]]; as such, every hobbit received at least one present at least every week. They were also responsible for cluttering the [[hobbit-holes]] with ''mathoms'' and other objects.<ref name=party>{{FR|Party}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nIts equivalent, in [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]], would be  ''byrding'', where ''[[Wiktionary:byrd|byrd]]'' means \"birth\".<ref name=letter>{{L|214}}</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nMany details of the gift-exchanging customs come from a draft of a [[Letter 214|letter]] Tolkien wrote. In that letter Tolkien mentions that he considered putting such details into the [[Prologue Concerning Hobbits, and other matters|Prologue]] but that would make it too long and overloaded according to some critics.\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{title|lowercase}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:ribadyan}}\n[[Category:Westron words]]"}}}
