This was known as 'beating the bounds'. The Bounders was the larger of the two branches of the [[Watch]] (the other being the twelve [[Shirriffs]]).<ref name=shire/> \n\nThe number of Bounders at any given time was varied according to need. In the run up to the [[War of the Ring]] they were greatly increased<ref name=shire>{{FR|Ordering}}</ref> and they were busy as strange persons and creatures approached the borders.<ref>{{FR|Shadow}}</ref>\n\nUnbeknownst to the Hobbits of the Shire this was the first sign that the troubles of the south would soon reach even their borders. [[Ruffians]] and spies of [[Isengard]] and [[Mordor]] began to enter [[Eriador]]. \n\n==Etymology==\nThe word means \"persons watching the boundaries\". \n\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] noted that the word was rare, probably because in the late 19th century slang it meant an offensively pushing and in-bred man.<ref name=\"Nomen\">{{HM|N}}, pp. 753-4</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''\n:A Bounder holding a lantern, played by [[Ian Mune]], confronts a [[Nazgûl|Black Rider]] in the night. He calls out \"Who goes there?\". The Nazgûl does not slow down and decapitates the Bounder with his blade.\n\n'''2003: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''\n:The voice of an unnamed bounder is provided by Karol Čálik.
