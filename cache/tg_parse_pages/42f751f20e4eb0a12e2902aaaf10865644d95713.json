However, the only aid that came from the Valar was that of [[Tulkas]], who in secret has sent his son [[Telimektar]] to Tol Eressëa to aid them.\n\nThere, Telimektar, with the help of Ingil, surprised Melko and wounded him, and chased him up the [[Pine of Tavrobel]] all the way to [[Ilwë]]. However, Melko kept attacking the [[Sun]] and the [[stars]], and in the end caused the death of [[Urwendi]] the steerer of the Sun-vessel.\n\nFinally, the Valar decided to cut down the great Pine, which left Melko stranded out of the world.\n\nHowever, Ingil and Telimektar had to remain in the sky, guarding ceaselessly until Melko's return in the [[Great End]]. There, [[Varda]] periodically gives Telimektar stars in order to replace the ones Melko destroys and to remind the world of the Valar's watch - and the constellation of [[wikipedia:Orion (constellation)|Orion]] is afterwards seen as Telimektar's image in the sky.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''4''', pp. 281-2</ref>\n\nAfter Ingil's \"ascent into heaven, when in likeness of a great [[Bees|bee]] bearing honey of flame he followed [[Daimort]]\",<ref group=note>''Daimort'' was another name for Telimektar.</ref> he acquired the (Gnomish) name '''''Gil''''', which was also used as the name of the star [[wikipedia:Sirius|Sirius]].<ref name=\"Gno\">{{PE|11}}, p. 38</ref> The image of Ingil in the sky, Sirius, was also known as [[Nielluin]].<ref>{{LT1|VIIIn}}, p. 200</ref>\n\n=== Later legendarium ===\nIn the later versions of the [[legendarium]], the character evolved to become '''[[Ingwion]]''', the son of [[Ingwë]].\n\n{{references|notes}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Qenya names]]\n[[Category:Rulers in Tol Eressëa]]\n[[Category:Teleri (early legendarium)]]\n[[de:Ingil]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/elfes/vanyar/ingil]]\n[[fi:Ingil]]"}}}
