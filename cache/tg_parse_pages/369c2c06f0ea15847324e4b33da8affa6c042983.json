The necklace was studded with five hundred emeralds as green as grass.\n\n== History ==\nPrior to the coming of the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Smaug]], Girion had traded the necklace to the Dwarves of [[Erebor]] in exchange for a coat of dwarf-linked rings wrought of pure silver that was three times as strong as steel. The coat was given to Girion's son.<ref name=\"Inside\">{{H|Inside}}</ref> In {{TA|2770}} Smaug attacked both [[Dale]] and the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]],<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> and the necklace became part of Smaug's hoard after the dragon occupied the [[Lonely Mountain]].<ref name=\"Inside\"/>\n\nAfter the death of the dragon, the [[Battle of Five Armies]], and the death of [[Thorin]], [[Dáin II]] became [[King under the Mountain]] and dealt the treasure wisely. [[Bard]], the heir of Girion, returned the [[Arkenstone]] to the Dwarves and in the one-fourteenth share given to Bard came the necklace of Girion. Bard then gave the emeralds to the [[Thranduil|Elvenking]], who was most fond of such gems, in thanks for the aid the [[Elves]] had rendered to the [[Lake-men]] of [[Esgaroth]].<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nOriginally [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] had created the '''Gem of Girion''' for ''[[The Hobbit]]'' so as to provide an easily transportable part of the hoard of Smaug for [[Bilbo Baggins]] to carry home. Changing his mind about having Bilbo slay Smaug, Tolkien introduced Bard into the plot. The Gem of Girion turned into the [[Arkenstone]] and was made the most coveted part of the treasure for [[Thorin]], and the necklace of Girion was invented to replace its role in the story.<ref>{{HH|While}}, (ii) ''The Arkenstone as Silmaril'', p. 603</ref>\n\n== Portrayal in adaptations ==\n'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''\n:Thranduil describes them as \"White gems of pure starlight\" and later Thorin Oakenshield finds them among the hoard of the Lonely Mountain, naming them as the \"White Gems of [[Lasgalen]]\" and gloats about how much an elf lord would pay for it. Thranduil claims the necklace is an Elven heirloom, however the fate of the necklace is not given in the film. A line from [[Gandalf]] not present in either the Theatrical or the Extended edition but found in the Appendices on the Blu-Ray reveals that the necklace belonged to Thranduil's wife, the last memento in the world left of her.\n\n'''2018: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The game's storyline establishes the Necklace of Girion to be the same as the [[Necklace of the Dwarves]]. Unable to use the name \"[[Nauglamír]]\" due to licensing restrictions, the necklace is named \"Gweriamir\", the \"Jewel of Betrayal\" instead. Its history is kept purposely vague to avoid directly referencing ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', but it is said to have been crafted by dwarves for [[Thingol]] and lost upon his death.\n\n:A series of pages from an elven account of history tell that the necklace of Girion was initially been crafted by the dwarves and given to the elves in friendship. The men recovered it from a troll-hoard, which is presumably how Girion came to have it. When the elves discovered that it has been given to the dwarves, it became a source of conflict. Following the Battle of Five Armies, it was given to Bard when the treasure of Smaug was divided up. Bard, seeing that the necklace was a point of contention between the elves and dwarves, broke it apart, giving the gold to the dwarves and the emeralds to the elves.\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Rings and jewels]]\n\n[[de:Halsschmuck von Girion]]\n[[fi:Girionin kaulakäädyt]]"}}}
