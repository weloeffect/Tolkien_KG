It was different from that used by the [[Men]], [[Dwarves]] and [[Elves]]. Use of this calendar in Middle-earth is referred to as '''[[Shire-reckoning]]'''.\n\nThe calendar featured 12 months, all 30 days long, plus 5 or 6 named days added to round out 365 days (or 366 for leap years).   Two of the named days were [[Yuledays]]; one was the first day of the year and the other was the last day of the year.  Between June and July were the [[Lithedays]].  In common years (not leap years) there were three: 1 Lithe, [[Mid-year's Day]], and 2 Lithe.  In leap years (every fourth year except in the last year of a century) an extra [[Overlithe]] Day was added after Mid-year's Day.  All of the named days were major holidays (and a reason for feasting) with Overlithe being a day of special merrymaking.<ref name=\"D1\">{{App|Shire}}</ref><ref name=\"D2\">{{App|Calendars}}</ref> The two Yuledays were actually a portion of Yuletide, which included the last three and first three days of each year.<ref name=\"D2\" />\n\nIn ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the names of months and days are given in modern equivalents. For instance, [[Afteryule]] is called ''January'' and [[Sterday]] is called ''Saturday''.<ref name=\"D2\" />\n\n==History==\nWhen the [[Hobbits]] were still a [[Wandering Days|wandering]] people, their calendaric unit was not a 'week', but a 'month', governed more or less by the [[Moon]]. In their old calendar, the new year began after harvest. This can be seen in the name of the month [[Winterfilth]] meaning \"filling (of the year) before winter\".\n\nHowever, through contact with alien peoples (perhaps the [[Dúnedain of Arnor]]) they adopted the notion of weeks which formed the [[Shire Reckoning]]. It was based on the [[King's Reckoning]] but with several minor alterations to fit their customs.\n\nOne innovation introduced by the [[Shire-hobbits]] was the '''[[Shire-reform]]''' (also eventually adopted in the [[Bree Calendar]]).  In the time of Thain [[Isengrim Took II|Isengrim II]] they arranged that Mid-year’s Day (and the Overlithe) would not have a weekday name, which stopped the shifting of weekday names in relation to dates.  This change made the first day of the year always correspond to the first day of the week, and the last day of the year always correspond to the last day of the week.  Over time, since the same date in any year had the same weekday name as in any other year, the Shire-folk ceased to record the weekday in letters and diaries.  Since no month began on a Friday this arrangement also birthed a jesting idiom in the Shire: \"On Friday the first\" referred to a non-existent day or one on which impossible things would occur (the full expression was \"on Friday the first of [[Summerfilth]]\").<ref name=\"D2\" />\n\n==Months of the year and special days==\nThe Shire calendar's year was divided into 12 months of 30 days. Five additional days were added to create a 365-day year.\n\nThe twelve months of the Shire Calendar were: [[Afteryule]], [[Solmath]], [[Rethe]], [[Astron]], [[Thrimidge]], [[Forelithe]], [[Afterlithe]], [[Wedmath]], [[Halimath]], [[Winterfilth]], [[Blotmath]], and [[Foreyule]].  Solmath was usually pronounced and sometimes written as Somath.  Thrimidge was often written Thrimich and Blotmath was pronounced as Blodmath or Blommath.\n\nIn the [[Eastfarthing]] the names of Afteryule, Astron, and Foreyule, were [[Frery]], [[Chithing]], and [[Yulemath]], respectively. These correspond for the names used in [[Bree]] for those months.<ref name=\"D2\" />\n\n{|border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"TGtable\"\n|- \n!Month number\n!Shire Name\n!Bree Name\n!Translation in ''The Lord of the Rings''\n!Approximate relationship to [[wikipedia:Gregorian calendar|Gregorian calendar]]<ref name=\"psarandoSR\">{{webcite|author=Paul Sarando|articleurl=https://psarando.github.io/shire-reckoning/#reckoning-start-dates|articlename=Shire Reckoning Notes|website=[https://psarando.github.io/shire-reckoning/ Shire Reckoning: A visualization of the calendars described in J.R.R.

The ''Lithedays'' (referred to as the ''Summerdays'' in Bree) are the three days in the middle of the year, 1 Lithe, Mid-year's Day, and 2 Lithe. In leap years (every fourth year except centennial years) a day was added after Mid-year's Day called ''Overlithe''. All these days were placed outside of any month. These days were primarily holidays and feast days. ''Mid-year's Day'' is meant to correspond to the [[wikipedia:Solstice|summer solstice]], being approximately 10 days earlier than the middle day of our year.<ref name=\"D2\" />\n\n== Days of the week ==\n\nThe seven weekdays of the Shire Calendar (at the time of the [[War of the Ring]]) were [[Sterday]], [[Sunday]], [[Monday]], [[Trewsday]], [[Hevensday]] (or Hensday), [[Mersday]], and [[Highday]].  The last day of the week, Highday, was the chief day, a post-noon holiday and time for evening feasts.\n\nThe Mid-year's Day and, when present, Overlithe had no weekday assignments. This arrangement was used because it caused every day to have the same weekday designation from year to year (instead of changing as in the [[wikipedia:Gregorian calendar|Gregorian calendar]]).\n\n{|class=\"TGtable\"\n|-\n!Day Name\n!Meaning\n!Translation in ''The Lord of the Rings''\n!Relationship to Gregorian calendar\n|-\n|''[[Sterday]]''||Stars of [[Varda]]||Saturday||Monday\n|-\n|''[[Sunday]]''||[[Sun]]||Sunday||Tuesday\n|-\n|''[[Monday]]''||[[Moon]]||Monday||Wednesday\n|-\n|''[[Trewsday]]''||[[Two Trees]] of Valinor||Tuesday||Thursday\n|-\n|''[[Hevensday]]''||[[Ilmen|Heavens]]||Wednesday||Friday\n|-\n|''[[Mersday]]''||[[Belegaer|Sea]]||Thursday||Saturday\n|-\n|''[[Highday]]''||[[Valar]]||Friday||Sunday\n|}\n\nHighday was a holiday with evening feasts.\n\nAll days of the week were translated in ''The Lord of the Rings'' according to the table above, except in Bilbo's Song where Saturday and Sunday were used in place of Mersday and Highday, to preserve the \"weekend\" meaning those week days have in the modern Gregorian calendar.<ref name=\"D2\" />\n\n==Inspiration==\nThe names of the months of the Shire Calendar are highly based on the [[wikipedia:Germanic calendar|Germanic calendar]].\n\n{{references}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://shire-reckoning.com/ The Shire-reckoning] website, dedicated to detailed analysis of the Hobbit Calendar.\n*The [https://psarando.github.io/shire-reckoning Shire Reckoning] project, dedicated to simulations and detailed analysis of all the calendars of ''The Lord of the Rings'' [[Appendix D]].\n\n[[Category:Hobbit Calendar]]\n[[Category:Calendars]]\n\n[[de:Auenland-Kalender]]\n[[fi:Konnun kalenteri]]"}}}
