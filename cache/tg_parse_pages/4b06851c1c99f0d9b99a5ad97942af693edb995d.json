There are currently {{NUMBEROFADMINS}} administrators.\n==Administrators' abilities==\nAdministrators have the technical ability to perform the following actions, including:\n\n*[[Special:BlockList|block user accounts]] and IP addresses from editing;\n*[[Special:Log/protect|apply (and remove) page protection]] to restrict editing of a particular page;\n*[[Tolkien Gateway:Deletion policy|delete pages]] and [[Tolkien Gateway:Image policy|images]];\n*revert pages quickly via the [rollback] function;\n*[[Special:Log/move|move a page]] over an already-existing page;\n*edit [[Special:ProtectedPages|protected pages]] (including the [[Main Page]]);\n*view and restore deleted pages;\n*hide and delete page revisions;\n*change [[Special:AllMessages|the interface]] by editing the MediaWiki namespace (including site-wide [[MediaWiki:Common.css|CSS]] and [[MediaWiki:Common.js|JavaScript]]).\n\nBy convention, administrators also normally take responsibility for judging - and, of course, enacting - the outcome of certain discussions, such as deletion and move discussions. This process is fairly informal, however.\n\n==Current administrators==\n\n* [[User:Hyarion|Hyarion]] <small>(since [[3 June]] [[2005]])</small>\n* [[User:Ederchil|Ederchil]] <small>(since [[17 August]] [[2008]])</small>\n* [[User:Mith|Mith]] <small>(since [[14 July]] [[2010]])</small>\n* [[User:Morgan|Morgan]] <small>(since [[12 June]] [[2013]])</small>\n* [[User:KingAragorn|KingAragorn]] <small>(since [[7 June]] [[2014]])</small>\n* [[User:Quentandil|Quentandil]] <small>(since [[27 December]] [[2021]])</small>\n\n==Becoming an administrator==\n{{seealso|Tolkien Gateway:Requests for adminship}}\n\nAdministrators are appointed following a [[Tolkien Gateway:Requests for adminship|request for adminship]], a [[Tolkien Gateway:Meetings|community meeting]], or by a [[Tolkien Gateway:Bureaucrats|bureaucrat]]. In a formal request for adminship, Tolkien Gateway has six defined criteria for adminship:\n\n#They have an account under a screen-name.\n#They have actively contributed for at least six months to the wiki.\n#They have demonstrated they are willing to take on additional responsibilities to make the community better.\n#They have had at least some major article revisions.\n#They have dealings with other users on a regular basis in a fair, restrained, and constructive manner.\n#They have demonstrated an understanding of the community's policies and procedures.\n\nIn such requests, voting must be unanimously in favour. Administrators need to have the trust and confidence of the community so administrators are usually those editors with considerable experience (currently, the six administrators are six of the seven [[Tolkien Gateway:Top Editors|top editors]]). Potential administrators also need to be very well-acquainted with Tolkien Gateway's [[Tolkien Gateway:Policy|policies]], [[Tolkien Gateway:Manual of Style|style guide]], and [[Help:Editing|procedures]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Tolkien Gateway: Bureaucrats]], users who have further responsibilities.\n\n[[Category:Tolkien Gateway]]"}}}
