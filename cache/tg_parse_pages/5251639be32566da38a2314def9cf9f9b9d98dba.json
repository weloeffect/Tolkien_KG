Initially populated by [[Green-elves|Laiquendi]] in the [[Elder Days]], it became an important Elvish realm in the following Ages, known for its havens and [[ships]] that would sail for the [[Aman|West]].\n\n==Geography==\nLindon was a name of [[Ossiriand]], a region west of the [[Blue Mountains]], in [[East Beleriand]]. After the deluge of [[Beleriand]] in the [[War of Wrath]], Lindon became the westernmost land of the continent of [[Middle-earth]].\n\nThe regions of [[Forlindon]] and [[Harlindon]] were the chief parts of Lindon, which extended north of the [[Gulf of Lune]] to include the lands east of the [[Blue Mountains]], and west of the River [[Lune]] as far as the inflow of the [[Little Lune]] (beyond that was [[Dwarves of the Blue Mountains|Dwarf]] territory).<ref group=\"note\">In ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', it is stated that after the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]] and the establishment of [[Imladris]], the realm of Lindon was diminished and did not extend beyond the [[Blue Mountains]] any more. This is contradictory to ''[[Appendix A]]'' which states that by the time the [[Red Book of Westmarch]] was written in the late [[Third Age]], the lands beyond the [[Lune]] were still part of Lindon.</ref><ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #75</ref><ref name=eriador>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>  South of the Lune it had no clear bounds, but the [[Tower Hills]] (as they were later called) were maintained as an outpost.<ref>{{PM|Atani}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Ar-Pharazôn]] captured Sauron and took him to [[Númenor]], the [[Westlands]] found peace, and Gil-galad was free to extend his power and influence so that the Elves of Lindon controlled most of the Westlands, even to the borders of [[Greenwood the Great]], until the [[Downfall of Númenor]], when Sauron returned to Middle-earth.<ref name=rings/>\n\nIn the tumult following the Downfall of Númenor, Lindon suffered great loss as \"the sea rode in upon the land\", and it shrank by the end of the Second Age.<ref>{{PM|VI}}, p. 183</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Elder Days===\n{{main|Ossiriand}}\nThe name Lindon was first used by the exiled [[Noldor]] for the region of [[Ossiriand]].<ref name=Beleriand>{{S|14}}</ref>\n\nLindon was the only part of Beleriand that survived the [[War of Wrath]], the rest of the land having been broken or submerged.<ref name=PMII78>{{PM|II}}, p. 78</ref> However, [[Belegaer]] the Great Sea broke through the mountain chain, creating the [[Gulf of Lhûn]].<ref name=rings/>\n\n===Second Age===\n[[File:Liz Danforth - Elves of Lindon.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Liz Danforth]] - ''Elves of Lindon'']]\nIn {{SA|1}}, the [[Elves]] built the [[Grey Havens]] in the newly-formed Gulf of Lhûn where the [[Eldar]] sailed the [[Straight Road]], but most of them were unwilling at first to forsake the lands they fought in and preferred to linger there. This was the foundation of Lindon. [[Gil-galad]] was the last heir of the [[King of the Noldor|kings of the Noldor]] in exile, and acknowledged as [[High King of the Noldor|High King of the Elves of the West]], so he was the king in Lindon.<ref name=SA/><ref name=rings/> \n\nIn the beginning of the [[Second Age]], most of the [[Noldor]] that remained in Middle-earth dwelt in Lindon, but many [[Teleri]], survivors of [[Doriath]] and [[Ossiriand]], left Lindon before {{SA|1000}} to establish realms among the [[Silvan Elves]].<ref name=rings/> [[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]] brought many Noldor, [[Sindar]], and [[Green-elves]] out of Lindon into [[Eriador]] to dwell there for some time.<ref name=concerning>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref> Many of the Noldor in Lindon led by [[Celebrimbor]] established the realm of [[Eregion]] in {{SA|750}} near the [[West-gate]] of [[Khazad-Dûm]] due to the recent discovery of [[mithril]] in Khazad-Dûm.<ref name=SA/> \n\nIn {{SA|600}}, [[Entulessë]], a ship from [[Númenor]], arrived in Mithlond where Gil-galad welcomed the [[Númenóreans]], before reestablishing contact with their [[Mannish]] kin, the [[Middle Men]].<ref>{{App|B1}}, entry \"600\"</ref><ref>{{UT|Island}}</ref>\n\nA fair being calling himself [[Annatar]], an emissary of the [[Valar]], came seeking entrance. Gil-galad and Master [[Elrond]] sensed that he was not what he seemed, and denied him. Messengers were sent from Lindon with warnings, but they were unheeded, and Annatar was received gladly, mostly in Eregion. However, Gil-galad and Elrond were proven correct, as Annatar was indeed [[Sauron]] and later, [[War of the Elves and Sauron|there was war in Eriador]].<ref name=rings>{{S|Rings}}</ref> Elrond led the forces of Lindon to [[Sack of Eregion|battle to defend Eregion]]. With them, and other [[Elves of Eregion|Elves]] who fled the destruction of Eregion, he established [[Imladris]] in {{SA|1697}}.<ref name=SA/> \n\nThe Elves called that time [[Dark Years|Days of Flight]] as many fled to Lindon and thence over the [[Sea]] to the [[Uttermost West]]. But in Lindon Gil-galad still maintained his power, and Sauron dared not as yet to pass the [[Ered Luin]] nor to assail the [[Grey Havens|Havens]]; and Gil-galad was aided by the [[Númenóreans]]. In the [[Dark Years]], Sauron had conquered most of the [[Westlands]], but in {{SA|1700}} [[Tar-Minastir]] sent a fleet to Lindon and the combined army of Lindon and Númenor drove Sauron's forces out of Eriador.<ref name=SA/><ref name=rings/> \n\n===Later history===\n[[File:Angelo Montanini - Northern Waste.jpg|thumb|left|''Northern Waste'' by Angelo Montanini]]\nAfter the fall of Gil-galad (during the time of the [[Kings of Arnor]]), there was still a remnant of his people, the [[Noldor]], who dwelt at the [[Grey Havens]] of further inland in Lindon, who, aside from [[Rivendell]], were most of the remaining Noldor of [[Middle-earth]]. [[Cirdan]] remained the Lord of the Havens and ruled Lindon from the Grey Havens.<ref name=eriador/><ref name=rings/> \n\nDuring the [[Third Age]], Lindon supported [[Arnor]] in the [[Angmar War]]. It assisted [[Arveleg I]] and [[Cardolan]] drive off the [[Hill-men]] from the [[Weather Hills]]. Later, with [[Círdan]]'s help, [[Arveleg I|Arveleg]]'s young son, [[Araphor]], drove [[Angmar]]'s armies from [[Fornost]] and the [[North Downs]]. Combining forces with [[Rivendell]], and the [[Galadhrim]] who joined them from beyond the [[Misty Mountains]], they subdued Angmar for some time.<ref name=eriador/> Lindon also assisted King [[Araval]] in a coalition with [[Rivendell]], in another battle against Angmar in {{TA|1851}}.<ref name=Elendil>{{PM|Elendil}}, pp. 195, 209-210</ref> In {{TA|1975}}, Elves from Lindon brought a ship to [[Forochel]] to rescue [[Arvedui Last-king]]. The crew endured a perilous journey, but Arvedui rashly attempted to return that winter, and all aboard perished.

[[Men]] did not settle in Lindon.<ref name=eriador/>\n\n==Names and etymology==\nIn a post-[[The Lord of the Rings|LotR]] writing, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] says that the name ''Lindon'' was coined by the Green-elves, derived from [[Nandorin]](?) *''Lindānā''. The Sindar called the country ''Dor Lindon'' and the Noldor ''Lindóne'' (or ''Lindónë''<ref>{{HM|IX}}</ref>) but both also adopted the name ''Lindon''.<ref name=WJC>{{WJ|C}}, p. 385</ref>\n\nThe name ''Lindon'' contains the element ''lin-'' (\"sing, song\") as also seen in [[Lindar]].<ref>{{S|Appendix}}</ref> ''Lindon'' means \"land of music\".<ref name=Beleriand/> \n\nThe translation \"Land of the singers\", conceived to be a name in the [[Nandorin|Ossiriandic]] tongue, has been suggested by [[David Salo]], [[Arden R. Smith|Arden Smith]], [[Patrick H. Wynne|Patrick Wynne]], et al. in their linguistic contribution to ''[[Arnor: The Land]]''\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn early versions of the ''[[The Lord of the Rings Appendices]]'', Gil-galad is said to have founded Lindon in {{SA}} 10.<ref>{{PM|VI}}, pp. 168, 173</ref>\n\n==Portrayals in adaptations==\n''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''\n:A [[Lindon (MERP)|supplement on Lindon]] was never released by [[Iron Crown Enterprises|ICE]], although there were such plans,<ref>{{ICE|8014}}, p. 15</ref> and Jeff J.
