The film, set 250 years before the events of ''The Lord of the Rings'', is primarily based on [[The Lord of the Rings Appendices|the Appendices]] and covers the story of [[Helm|Helm Hammerhand]], and the history behind the founding of [[Hornburg|Helm's Deep]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe film is set around 250 years before the events of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', covering the period of time when [[Helm|Helm Hammerhand]] was [[Kings of Rohan|King of Rohan]].

Overall, the movie is a companion piece to New Line’s LOTR trilogy and is set roughly 250 years before that movie during the third age''\".<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=https://deadline.com/2021/06/lord-of-the-rings-anime-film-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-new-line-1234773024/|articlename=‘The Lord Of The Rings’ Goes On: Anime Film ‘The War Of The Rohirrim’ In Works At New Line|author=Anthony D'Alessandro|dated=10 June 2021|website=[https://deadline.com Deadline]|accessed=30 December 2021}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n{{Rewrite}}\n[[Éowyn]] narrates the tale of [[Helm's daughter|Héra]], a shieldmaiden of [[Rohan]], daughter of King [[Helm Hammerhand]], who lived nearly two centuries before [[Bilbo Baggins]] came across the [[One Ring]].\n\n[[Freca]], a Dunlending chieftain, arrives at King Helm's hall accompanied by his son, Wulf, a childhood companion of Héra. Furious upon learning that Héra is to be wed to a noble of [[Gondor]], Freca attempts to compel a union between Wulf and Héra in a bid to seize control of Rohan. Though Wulf harbors genuine feelings for Héra, she has no desire to marry at all. A confrontation between Helm and Freca escalates into a fist-fight outside the hall, during which Helm, with a single blow, unintentionally kills Freca thus earning the name \"Hammerhand.\"\n\nStricken by grief and rage, Wulf swears vengeance and disappears without a trace. Years later, Héra and her cousin [[Fréaláf]] discover the corpse of a dead Southron warrior—a tamer of [[Oliphaunts]]. Moments later, the warrior’s rabid Oliphaunt emerges and attacks them. Héra cleverly lures the beast to a forest lake, where it is seized and devoured by a lurking [[Watcher in the Water]]. Soon after, she is captured by Targg, one of Freca’s old commanders, and taken to Isengard, now Wulf’s stronghold. There, she learns that Wulf has risen to lead the Dunlendings. In an attempt to stop the coming invasion, Héra offers herself in marriage to Wulf, but is rescued in time by Fréaláf and her lady-in-waiting [[Olwyn]].\n\nWulf marches on Rohan. Helm, refusing Fréaláf’s counsel to evacuate [[Edoras]] to the refuge of [[Dunharrow]], brands him a coward and banishes him. Helm prepares for war after [[Lord Thorne]] pledges support, but Héra uncovers Thorne’s treachery. He attempts to kill her, but she survives and slays him with the help of her steed, [[Ashere]]. Realizing Helm’s army has been betrayed and outnumbered, Héra leads the people of Edoras to safety at the [[Hornburg]]. In the ensuing battle, Wulf kills Helm’s son [[Haleth (son of Helm)|Haleth]], then captures his brother [[Háma (son of Helm)|Háma]], executing him before Helm’s eyes—ignoring Helm’s plea to take his own life instead. Wulf lays siege to the Hornburg throughout the bitter winter, constructing a massive siege-tower.\n\nGravely wounded and broken-hearted, Helm begins venturing out under cover of darkness via a secret passage, slaying foes with his bare hands. On one of these night raids, Héra finds him and aids him in defeating a troll. During their return, she witnesses two [[Orc|orcs]] from [[Mordor]] looting rings from the fallen, acting on the orders of [[Sauron|their master]]. Helm escorts her back to the Hornburg, then stays behind to hold off the enemy. He perishes in the snow, upright and unyielding, frozen in death.\n\nHéra sends [[Eagle|an eagle]] bearing her father’s armor to summon Fréaláf. Donning an ancient bridal gown, she rides out to confront Wulf on the siege-tower bridge he has just lowered to storm the Hornburg, issuing a challenge to single combat. Her goal is to buy time for the Rohirrim to escape through a hidden tunnel. She defeats Wulf and demands his surrender. Targg, who had previously urged Wulf to abandon the siege, agrees with her, but Wulf slays him in defiance. At that moment, Fréaláf arrives with reinforcements, bearing Helm’s horn and armor—symbols that terrify the Dunlendings, who believe Helm has returned from the grave. Panic spreads, and the enemy flees. Wulf lunges at Héra, but she kills him by strangling him with a shield strap, thus bringing the war to an end.\n\nHelm’s legacy is immortalized in the naming of [[Helm's Deep]], the valley and fortress of the Hornburg. [[Saruman]] is revealed to be the new master of [[Isengard]], offering friendship to Fréaláf, who is crowned king. Héra, disinterested in ruling, sets off with Olwyn to explore the wider world. Her first new journey brings her to [[Gandalf]], who seeks answers about the orcs she saw and their quest for rings. Éowyn concludes her story, saying that Héra remained fierce and free-hearted to the end of her days.\n\n==Cast==\n===Credited===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! !!Actor!!Role(s)\n|-\n|1\n|[[Brian Cox]]||[[Helm|Helm Hammerhand]]\n|-\n|2\n|[[Gaia Wise]]||[[Helm's daughter|Héra]]\n|-\n|3\n|[[Miranda Otto]]||[[Éowyn]] (narrator)\n|-\n|4\n|[[Luke Pasqualino]]||[[Wulf]]\n|-\n|5\n|[[Lorraine Ashbourne]]||[[Olwyn]]\n|-\n|6\n|[[Shaun Dooley]]||[[Freca]]\n|-\n|7\n|[[Benjamin Wainwright]]||[[Haleth (son of Helm)|Haleth]]\n|-\n|8\n|[[Yazdan Qafouri]]||[[Háma (son of Helm)|Háma]]\n|-\n|9\n|[[Laurence Ubong Williams]]||[[Fréaláf]]\n|-\n|10\n|[[Michael Wildman]]||[[General Targg]]\n|-\n|11\n|Janine Duvitski||[[Old Pennicruik]]\n|-\n|12\n|[[Bilal Hasna]]||[[Lief]]\n|-\n|13\n|[[Jude Akuwudike]]||[[Lord Thorne]]\n|-\n|14\n|[[Billy Boyd]]||[[Shank]]\n|-\n|15\n|[[Dominic Monaghan]]||[[Wrot]]\n|-\n|16\n|Alex Jordan||[[Lord Frygt]]<ref> {{webcite|author=[https://x.com/AlexJordanVO Alex Jordan]|articleurl=https://twitter.com/AEJORDAN/status/1537058197005017089|articlename=I'm excited to announce that I’ll be voicing the character of Lord Frygt in The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim.
