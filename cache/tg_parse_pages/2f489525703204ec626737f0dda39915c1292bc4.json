Tolkien]] in [[1930]], first published in ''[[The Welsh Review (Vol.IV, No.4)|The Welsh Review]]'' in December [[1945]]. It was published in its own volume in [[2016]], edited by [[Verlyn Flieger]], together with two shorter poems.\n\n''Aotrou'' and ''Itroun'' are [[Wikipedia:Breton language|Breton]] words for \"lord\" and \"lady\". The poem is modelled on the genre of the \"[[Wikipedia:Breton lai|Breton lay]]\" popular in Middle English literature of the 12th century, and it explores the conflict of heroic or chivalric values and Christianity, and their relation to the institution of marriage.\n\n==Contents==\n* Cover\n* Title Page\n* Copyright\n* List of Plates\n* Epitaph\n* Note on the Text\n* Introduction\n* Acknowledgments\n\n* Part One: ''The Lay of Aotrou and Itroun''\n** ''The Lay of Aotrou and Itroun''\n** Notes and Commentary\n\n* Part Two: ''The Corrigan'' Poems\n** Introduction\n** 'The Corrigan' I\n** Notes and Commentary\n** 'The Corrigan' II: A Breton Lay - after: 'Aotrou Nann Hag ar Gorrigan' a lay of Leon\n** Notes and Commentary\n\n* Part Three: The Fragment, Manuscript Drafts and Typescript\n** The Fragment\n** The Manuscript Drafts\n** ''Aotrou & Itroun'' (fair copy manuscript)\n** Notes and Commentary\n** The Typescript\n** Commentary\n\n* Part Four: Comparative Verses\n** Comparative Verses\n** ''Opening verses: Breton, French, English''; Tolkien\n** ''Closing verses: Breton, French, English''; Tolkien\n* Footnotes\n* Works Cited\n* About the Author and Editor\n* Works by J.R.R.

Tolkien - Aotrou and Itroun.jpg|thumb|First folio of the manuscript]]\n\nIn the poem, Aotrou and Itroun are a couple of Breton nobility. They are childless, and Aotrou seeks the help of a witch. When Itroun is with child, the witch reappears, revealing herself as the Corrigan, and asks for Aotrou's love as payment. Aotrou sacrifices his knightly honour to Christian values, and breaks his word.\n\n{{blockquote|\"I gave no love. My love is wed;<br />\nmy wife now lieth in child-bed,<br />\nand I curse the beast that cheated me<br />\nand drew me to this dell to thee.\"}}\n\nCursed by the Corrigan to die in three days, Aotrou takes the consequences and places his trust in Providence:\n\n{{blockquote|In three days I shall live at ease<br />\nand die but when it God doth please<br />\nin eld, or in some time to come<br />\nin the brave wars of Christendom.}}\n\nAotrou died after three days, followed by his wife with a broken heart. They are buried together, and they do not live to see their offspring grow up.\n\n==Relation to the legendarium==\nWhile not being among Tolkien's works on the [[legendarium]], ''The Lay of Aotrou and Itroun'' includes aspects which appear to have inspired his tales of [[Arda]]:\n*It has been noted that Tolkien [[Ere iron was found or tree was hewn#Inspiration|re-used a phrase from the poem]] in ''[[The Two Towers]]''.<ref>{{webcite|author=Alan Reynolds|articleurl=http://www.facebook.com/groups/TheTolkienSociety.EducationalCharity/permalink/10154585138321068/|articlename=Tolkien Society Facebook group post|dated=5 December 2016|website=FB|accessed=5 December 2016}}</ref>\n*The ''corrigan'' has been recognized as a pre-cursor of [[Galadriel]].<ref>{{Corrigan|Intro}}, p. xvi</ref>\n\n==Publication history and gallery==\nInitially ''The Lay of Aotrou and Itroun'' was published in ''[[The Welsh Review (Vol.IV, No.4)|The Welsh Review]]'' vol.IV, no.4 in [[1945]].<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.tolkienbooks.net/php/details.php?reference=31350|articlename=Welsh Review. 1945|dated=|website=TB|accessed=22 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nMore than 50 years later, the poem was first reprinted as a bilingual (Serbian/English) standalone book ''[[Pesma o Otruu i Itrun]]'' in [[2002]], in a limited edition of 500 copies.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.unesco.org/xtrans/bsresult.aspx?lg=0&a=Tolkien&l=srp&fr=10|articlename=Index Translationum (search result for Tolkien + Serbian)|dated=|website=[http://www.unesco.org Unesco.org]|accessed=22 June 2013}}</ref> An expanded edition of it was published in June [[2015]].<ref>[https://www.art-anima.com/pesma-o-otruu-i-itrun/ PESMA O OTRUU I ITRUN – Dž.R.R.
