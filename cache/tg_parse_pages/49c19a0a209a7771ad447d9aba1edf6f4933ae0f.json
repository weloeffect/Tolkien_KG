Tolkien]], [[1956]]<ref>[[Letter to H. Cotton Minchin (16 April 1956)]]</ref>}}\n'''Tolkien studies''' is the scholarly research of the works of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. This includes his fictional literature and languages and his philological work.\n\n==History==\n===Tolkien's Scholarship===\nTolkien's own academic research has had a great impact within the field of philology. \n\nTolkien wrote many of the entries under \"W\" in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' and many of those entries still survive this day as he originally wrote them.<ref>[[Peter Gilliver]], [[Jeremy Marshall]], [[Edmund Weiner]], ''[[The Ring of Words]]''</ref>\nHe also wrote the groundbreaking ''[[A Middle English Vocabulary]]'' which looked at common words instead of exotic words.<ref>Margaret L. Lee, \"Middle English\", published in ''[[The Year's Work in English Studies]]'', vol II (1922), pp. 41-53, esp. 42-3</ref>  \n\nHis lecture titled ''[[Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics]]'' changed scholars' understanding of the epic poem. During his time it was largely viewed as a historical document, but Tolkien argued that it should be examined as a literary work of art. This method of studying Beowulf is now popular today.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics]]'', \"Introduction\"</ref>\n\n===Age of Innocence===\nGenerally, the history of Tolkien scholarship is divided into four time periods: \n*the book reviews\n*the cult period and the fierce reactions to it\n*the acceptance of Tolkien as a literary agent\n*and lastly, the post-[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|movie]] phase, featuring expanded volumes, reprints, and a wide variety of subjects.<ref name=\"ScholOverview\">[[Brian Rosebury]], \"Tolkien Scholarship: An Overview\", published in ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia]]'' (edited by [[Michael D.C. Drout]]), pp. 653-654</ref>\n\nThe first two periods have been summarized by [[Tom Shippey]] as the \"Age of Innocence\": the time before the publishing of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'' and ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''. After the publishing of at least some of those, many musings, theories and guesses were flattened by additional information.<ref name=\"CompFore\">[[Tom Shippey]], \"Foreword\" published in ''[[A Tolkien Compass]]'' (third edition) (edited by [[Jared Lobdell]]), pp. vii-xi</ref> The field of literary critics taking interest was still thin, and serious academic research was rare. The first conference on Tolkien's literature was held in [[1966]]; before that, only collected works on children's literature had picked up serious attention for ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref name=\"ScholFirst\">[[Richard C. West]], \"Tolkien Scholarship: First Decades: 1954-1980\", published in ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia]]'' (edited by [[Michael D.C. Drout]]), pp. 654-656</ref>\n\n===1,800 New Entries===\nA major turn in scholarship was the publishing of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', edited by [[Christopher Tolkien]]. The book included the history of things that were previously no more than a \"background-word\", such as [[Beren]]<ref>{{FR|I11}}, \"[[Song of Beren and Lúthien]]\"</ref> or [[Gondolin]].<ref>{{H|3}}, [[Elrond]] explaining the origin of [[Glamdring]] and [[Orcrist]]</ref> Apart from many expanded entries, the second edition of [[J.E.A. Tyler]]'s ''[[The Tolkien Companion]]'' included some 1,800 new entries.<ref>[[Colin Duriez]], ''[[Tolkien and the Lord of the Rings]]'', p. 47</ref> A landmark publication of this time was Shippey's ''[[The Road to Middle-earth]]''.<ref name=\"ScholOverview\" />\n\n==Fields==\n===Linguistics===\n====Invented languages====\n{{main|Languages}}\n\n====Philology====\n===Literature===\n===Christianity===\n===Philosophy===\n\n==Courses==\n{{expansion}}\nThere are a number of universities and colleges that offer course work in Tolkien studies.
