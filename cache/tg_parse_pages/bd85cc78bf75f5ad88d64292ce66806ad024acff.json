They were the Dwarves that stayed behind to rebuild the Dwarven Halls in the [[Blue Mountains]] which were destroyed during the [[War of Wrath]]. They later aligned themselves with [[Angmar]] during the [[War of the Ring]].\n\n==History==\nSome time during the [[Third Age]], the Dourhands were experiencing great poverty and hunger. Under the leadership of [[Skorgrím]] they raided the Elven refuge of Edhelion for their relics and treasures. He also had the Dourhands ally themselves with the [[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|Goblins]] and [[Trolls]] to drive out the Elves. Yet, it was not enough and he was slain in battle. Leaderless, the remaining Dourhands scattered throughout [[Eriador]], setting up strongholds and camps.\n\nSix hundred years later, shortly before the [[War of the Ring]], a Gaunt-lord from the [[First Age]] named Ivar who dwelled in Garth Agarwen, an ancient fortress of [[Rhudaur]], summoned a fell spirit to possess the preserved corpse of Skorgrím. The wight managed to convince the Dourhands that Skorgrím had risen from the dead, making them an ally of the forces of [[Angmar]].\n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings Online characters]]\n[[Category:Concepts from adaptations]]"}}}
