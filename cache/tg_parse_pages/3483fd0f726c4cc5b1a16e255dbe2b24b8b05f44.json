The sky in those regions is permanently darkened, with in-game day being near-indistinguishable from the nighttime. The common folk of Gondor whom the player meets during this time are almost all in despair about what this new misfortune means for them.\n\n: In 2023, the game added another version of Gondor (sans Anórien) chronologically set after the end of the [[War of the Ring]], allowing the players to experience its lands without the Dawnless Day's oppressive presence.\n\n{{references|note}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dawnless Day, The}}\n[[Category:Events]]\n[[Category:Third Age]]"}}}
