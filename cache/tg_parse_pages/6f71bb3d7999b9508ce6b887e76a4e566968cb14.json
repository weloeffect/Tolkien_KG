Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Hobbit]]''.\n\n==From the publisher==\n\nA parody of JRR Tolkien’s fantasy prequel masterpiece, ''The Wobbit A Parody (Of The Hobbit)'' is a tale of low-to-medium adventure with plenty of cheap laughs. \n\nThe quest begins when thirteen dwarf bankers go in search of the dragon who stole their deposits and ate their borrowers. They visit a former employee and hire him back as a contractor: former teller Bulbo Bunkins (who would rather be enjoying a cocktail in his recliner.) Bulbo surprises the dwarves with his ability to “think outside the strong-box,” like when he points out that none of the dwarves have brought swords with on their dragon-slaying mission. Encounters with gourmet trolls, wiseguy goblins, resort-keeper elves, deadly but comforting giant spiders, and the egocentric dragon, Smug, are just a few of the adventures that Bulbo puts up with. Finally, when he thinks things can't get any worse, he finds himself making a guest appearance at the Battle Of Six Or Seven Armies. \n\nThe author hopes that Bulbo Bunkins soon takes a place among the immortal characters of parody literature, like The Tick and Scrooge McDuck. Written by an actual unemployed banker, ''The Wobbit A Parody (Of The Hobbit)'' will, with any luck at all, earn enough money to make his return to banking unnecessary.\n\n==External links==\n\n*[http://www.thewobbitaparody.com/ Official website]\n*[http://sacnoths.blogspot.com/2012/03/wobbit.html Review] by [[John D.
