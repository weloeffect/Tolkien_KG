The ruffians among them were working for [[Saruman]], and it was because of him and his interest in procuring [[pipe-weed]] for himself that they were traveling north. Some of them left to carry pipe-weed and other goods from the Shire back south to [[Isengard]], while others remained and helped [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins|Lotho]] take over the Shire. Soon even more Men came. They felled [[trees|trees,]] built sheds and houses for themselves across the Shire and ordered the hobbits around, taking what they wanted and suppressing any dissent.<ref>{{Cite DTP|id=LR 6.08.169}}</ref>\n\nAround the same time some Men came to [[Bree]] up the [[Greenway]] from the south. While some of them were refugees, many were bad men.<ref>{{Cite DTP|id=LR 6.07.027}}</ref> Before the end of {{TA|3018}} the [[Bree-landers]] expelled the new-comers from Bree, but early in the {{TA|3019}} after a heavy snowfall these Men attacked Bree with the help of [[Harry Goatleaf]] and [[Bill Ferny]], who might have let them in. In a resulting [[Set-to in Bree|set-to]] five Bree-landers were killed, but the ruffians were defeated.<ref>{{Cite DTP|id=LR 6.07.029}}</ref> Some of them retreated to the woods beyond [[Archet]], where they lived as robbers,<ref>{{Cite DTP|id=LR 6.07.030}}</ref> while some others, like Bill Ferny, joined Sharkey's Men in the Shire.<ref>{{Cite DTP|id=LR 6.08.019}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile in the Shire, soon after the New Year of {{TA|3019}}, Lotho declared himself the [[Chief Shirriff]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite DTP|id=LR 6.08.170}}</ref> However, [[Paladin Took II|Paladin Took]], the [[Thain]] of the Shire, refused to acknowledge Lotho's authority and didn't let the ruffians to enter [[Tookland]]. This lead to skirmishes, in which three ruffians, as well as one or two hobbits, were shot. After that the ruffians became more ruthless.<ref>{{Cite DTP|id=LR 6.08.141}}</ref> On [[22 September|September 22]], {{TA|3019}}, when Sharkey himself came to the Shire and usurped Lotho, the actions of the ruffians became even harsher.<ref name=\":0\" /> By that time the Shire was occupied by about 300 ruffians,<ref>{{Cite DTP|id=LR 6.08.137}}</ref> armed with whips, [[knives]], clubs and some [[bows]].<ref>{{Cite DTP|id=LR 6.08.139}}</ref>\n\nOne of the leaders of the ruffians was killed<ref>{{Cite DTP|id=LR 6.08.159}}</ref> and about a score of them<ref>{{Cite DTP|id=LR 6.08.147}}</ref> were captured<ref>{{Cite DTP|id=LR 6.08.160}}</ref> by the [[Shire-hobbits]] on [[2 November|November 2]], during the rebellion in Bywater. As a result of the [[Battle of Bywater]] on the next day, [[3 November|November 3]], nearly seventy more ruffians were killed and buried in the [[Battle Pit]], and a dozen imprisoned.<ref>{{Cite DTP|id=LR 6.08.198}}</ref> After that the southern gangs of ruffians offered little resistance and fled from the Shire, and those ruffians who were captured were shown to the borders.<ref>{{Cite DTP|id=LR 6.09.006}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Ruffian'' is an [[Modern English|English]] word that derives from the [[Wikipedia:Middle French|Middle French]] word ''rufian'', which itself derives from the [[Wikipedia:Italian language|Italian]] word ''ruffiano'' (“pimp”).
