Later it came to the possession of [[Dior]], son of Beren, and he restored the kingdom of [[Doriath]] after it was [[battle in the Thousand Caves|sacked]] by the [[Dwarves of Nogrod]]. However the sons of Fëanor [[Second Kinslaying|attacked]] Doriath hoping to gain the Silmaril, but it escaped their grasp when [[Elwing]], daughter of Dior, fled with it along with the survivors of Doriath to the [[Mouths of Sirion]].<ref>{{S|22}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Prelude===\nWhen [[Maedhros]] learned that [[Elwing]] survived the destruction of Doriath and dwelt in the Havens with the Silmaril, he withheld his hand but soon the oath compelled him to act and sent word to the Havens demanding the jewel. The peoples of the Havens as well as Elwing refused.<ref name=\"TSVE\">{{S|24}}</ref> \n\n===Battle===\nAs a final resort, the Sons of Fëanor sacked the Havens in what was considered to be the 'cruellest of the [[Kinslaying (disambiguation)|slayings]] of Elf by Elf'. Some of the Fëanorians did not take part in the slaughter and rebelled against their lords aiding Elwing and in turn they were slain. Maedhros and [[Maglor]] emerged victorious at the end but they did not gain the Silmaril for Elwing had cast herself into the sea with it. [[Amrod]] and [[Amras]] were slain in the battle leaving only Maedhros and Maglor as the remaining sons of Fëanor.<ref name=TSVE/>\n[[File:Jenny Dolfen - As little might be thought.jpeg|thumb|200px|''As little might be thought'' by [[Jenny Dolfen]]]]\nThe [[Men|Mannish]] poet [[Dírhavel]] was also among those who fell.<ref>{{UT|2n}}</ref> \n\n===Aftermath===\nWhen the news of the raid by the Sons of Fëanor reached [[Balar]], [[Círdan]] and [[Gil-galad]] sailed to the Havens but were too late to help the Elves. The survivors of the raid joined Círdan and Gil-galad to the Isle of Balar. [[Elrond]] and [[Elros]], sons of [[Eärendil]] and Elwing, were captured by Maedhros and Maglor, although later Maglor grew to love them and adopted them.<ref name=TSVE/>\n\nElwing and the Silmaril were not lost as [[Ulmo]] bore her up from the waves and took the form of a great white bird and she flew over the sea seeking Eärendil.
