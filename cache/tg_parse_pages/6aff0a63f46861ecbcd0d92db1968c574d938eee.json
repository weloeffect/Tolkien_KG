The attackers subsequently burned, then razed the fortress to the ground.  King Arveleg I was killed, but some of the Dúnedain retreated and escaped with the ''[[Palantír]]'' that was stationed there.\n\n===Aftermath===\nAmon Sûl was the main defensive outpost in the [[Weather Hills]] and northern Cardolan.  With it gone the Witch-King was able to take and ravage Cardolan, as well as consolidate his new conquests in [[Rhudaur]], which his [[Hill-Men]] allies and subjects had taken, as well as launch attacks against the whole of [[Arthedain]].\n      \nHowever despite permanently ending the threat that was Cardolan, Angmar was unable to ride its momentum, and was driven away from the city of [[Fornost]] and the [[North Downs]] by the forces of the new King [[Araphor]] and Lord [[Círdan]] of [[Lindon]].\n[[Category:Conflicts of the Angmar War]]\n[[Category:Sieges]]"}}}
