Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]''. It was followed in 1980 by an animated version of ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]'', the final book of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy. Rankin/Bass could not adapt the first two books of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', as the animation rights for the two books were held by [[Saul Zaentz]], producer of [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s cartoon adaptation of the first half of the trilogy, entitled [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)]].\n\nThe company was dissolved in 2001 and currently, the distribution rights of both ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]'' belong to [[Warner Bros.]]\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.rankinbass.com Official Website]\n\n[[Category:Businesses]]\n[[Category:American businesses]]"}}}
