His most famous deed was the creation of the [[Silmarils]], whose theft made him lead his people to the [[Exile of the Noldor|exile]]. As the leader of the rebellion, his passionate hatred of [[Morgoth]] and terrible [[Oath of Fëanor|oath]] led directly to the great triumphs and tragedies of the [[First Age]].\n\n==History==\n===Life in Tirion===\nBorn in {{YT|1169}},<ref>{{MR|P2k}}, p. 101, note 1</ref> Fëanor was the eldest son of [[Finwë]], the first [[King of the Noldor]], and his first wife [[Míriel|Míriel Þerindë]].

Following a [[Statute of Finwë and Míriel|judgment]] by the [[Valar]], Finwë was allowed to remarry and, with his second wife [[Indis]], had two more sons, Fëanor's half-brothers [[Fingolfin]] and [[Finarfin]],<ref name=\"Feanor\">{{S|Feanor}}</ref> and two daughters, [[Findis]] and [[Írimë]].<ref name=\"Shibboleth\" />\n[[File:Ryszard Derdziński - Feanor.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Feanor, deviser of the Tengwar.

Pardoned and residing in [[Valinor]], he undertook to corrupt the [[Noldor]] and succeeded in making them instruments of his malice, particularly Fëanor. But Fëanor greatly mistrusted [[Melkor]], which was part of Melkor's plan.<ref name=\"Feanor\" />\n\nInspired by a shadow of foreknowledge, he pondered how the [[light]] of the [[Two Trees]] might be preserved imperishable.<ref name=\"Silmarils\">{{S|Unrest}}</ref> Many thought that this idea came first after seeing the [[Hair of Galadriel]], which was both golden and silver. He admired her hair so much that he requested a tress three times, but [[Galadriel]] refused each time and would not give him even a single strand.<ref>{{UT|6}}, p. 230</ref> Therefore, in {{YT|1449|n}}, Fëanor began, and by {{YT|1450|n}} he had succeeded<ref name=\"AAsec4\" /> in the greatest of his achievements: capturing the light of the Two Trees to make the three [[Silmarils]], also called the Great Jewels. He prized the Silmarils above all else, and displayed them in feasts upon his brow. But later he grew increasingly suspicious that the Valar and other Eldar coveted them, until he jealously guarded them from all except his immediate family.<ref name=\"Silmarils\" />\n\n===Feud with Fingolfin===\n[[Image:Antti Autio - The Threat of Feanor.jpg|thumb|left|''The Threat of Feanor'' by [[Antti Autio]]]]\n[[Melkor]] greatly desired the [[Silmarils]] and his hatred for Fëanor grew, but the Valar still did not know of Melkor's true intentions. Melkor played upon Fëanor's temperament and pride to convince him that his own half-brother [[Fingolfin]] was not only planning to usurp his place as heir to [[Finwë]], but also seize the jewels for himself.<ref name=\"Silmarils\" /> The Noldor then began forging weapons, which at that point no other [[Eldar]] possessed in [[Valinor]]. Fëanor's hostility grew to the point where, in {{YT|1490|n}},<ref name=\"AAsec4\" /> he threatened Fingolfin's life. For this, the Valar exiled him to [[Formenos]]. He took a substantial treasure with him, including the [[Silmarils]], which he stowed in a locked box. In a show of support for his eldest son, Finwë withdrew to Formenos as well.<ref name=\"Silmarils\" />\n\nThe [[Valar]] realized that Melkor was behind Fëanor's actions. They sent [[Tulkas]] to imprison him again, but he could not be found. Melkor was not seen for a long time until, in {{YT|1492|n}},<ref name=\"AAsec4\" /> he unexpectedly showed up at [[Formenos]]. Melkor tried again to manipulate Fëanor, but he went too far, and Fëanor realized that Melkor's true goal was to obtain the Silmarils. He shut the door in Melkor's face and, in a rage, Melkor left. When the Valar heard of the incident, they resumed their hunt, but it was apparent that Melkor had fled from Valinor.<ref name=\"Silmarils\" />\n\n===Theft of the Silmarils===\nIn {{YT|1495|n}},<ref name=\"AAsec4\" /> the Valar sought to reconcile Fëanor and [[Fingolfin]], and to mend the enmity between the Noldor and Valar, and invited them all to Valimar to make peace. Fingolfin offered a hand to his half-brother, recognizing Fëanor's place as the eldest, which he grudgingly accepted.\n[[File:Lída Holubová - Feanor and his sons.jpg|thumb|''Feanor and his sons'' by [[:Category:Images by Lída Holubová|Lída Holubová]]]]\nMeanwhile, after first feigning to go north, [[Melkor]] had stolen away to [[Avathar]] in the south of [[Aman]] to seek out the evil, spider-like creature [[Ungoliant]]. Even as Fëanor and Fingolfin were reconciled, Ungoliant helped Morgoth destroy the Two Trees, bringing darkness to [[Valinor]].<ref>{{S|Darkening}}</ref>\n\n[[Yavanna]] examined the [[Two Trees]] and found them lifeless. The light of the Trees survived only in the [[Silmarils]] and she said that only by their power could she restore the Trees. [[Manwë]] then asked Fëanor to give them up for this purpose, but Fëanor emphatically declared that he would not give up his Silmarils of his own free will; if the Valar forced him, he said, they would be no better than Melkor. It was after this that messengers came telling of the raid at [[Formenos]].\n\nAccording to the messengers, Melkor, surrounded by an impenetrable black fog, had come to Fëanor's vault in [[Formenos]]. [[Finwë]] fought and lost against Melkor, and was the first to be slain in Valinor. Melkor ransacked the vault, taking many valuable jewels, including the Silmarils. He and Ungoliant escaped by crossing the [[Helcaraxë]], or Grinding Ice, in the north to [[Beleriand]] in [[Middle-earth]].<ref name=\"Flight\">{{S|Flight}}</ref>\n\n===Kingship===\n====Kin-slaying at Alqualondë====\n[[File:Angel Falto - Feanor (The Oath).jpg|thumb|left|''Fëanor (The Oath)'' by [[:Category:Images by Angel Falto|Angel Falto]]]]\n\nThe Valar and Eldar now fully understood the extent of Melkor's treachery. Fëanor, upon learning of his father's murder and the theft of his prized Silmarils, named Melkor \"''Morgoth''\", or \"Black Enemy\". Following his father's death, Fëanor claimed the [[King of the Noldor|kingship of the Noldor]] and delivered an [[Speech of Fëanor|impassioned speech]], which he unwittingly filled with Morgoth's lies. He rallied the Noldor against the Dark Lord, but because of Morgoth's influence, he also blamed the Valar for Morgoth's deeds. He persuaded most of his people that because the Valar could not protect them, the Noldor must follow him to Middle-earth and fight the Dark Lord. Fëanor then swore the terrible [[Oath of Fëanor]] which all seven of his sons also proclaimed, vowing to fight anyone and everyone—whether Elf, Man, Maia, or Vala—who withheld the Silmarils, and invoking even [[Ilúvatar]] as a witness. This Oath led to much conflict and later caused great tragedy among his seven sons.\n\nSeeking a way to get to Middle-earth, he went to the shores of Aman, where the seafaring [[Teleri]] lived, and demanded the use of their ships. When the Teleri refused to give or lend their vessels, Fëanor ordered the Noldor to take the ships by force. The Teleri resisted, and a battle broke out, in which many of the Teleri were slain, for they were armed with mere hunting bows, against the fully armed Noldor. Three times the Teleri were able to push back Fëanor until Fingon, leading the host of Fingolfin his father, joined the battle thus overwhelming the Teleri.\n\nDue to this act, the Valar proclaimed the [[Doom of the Noldor]], in which they prophesied failure for all those who followed the House of Fëanor. Fëanor resolved to go on, and added a further prophetic statement that their deeds would live on in song until the ending of the world. However, those who repented came back with [[Finarfin]], [[Finwë]]'s third son. They were accepted by the Valar, and Finarfin ruled as King of the remaining Noldor in [[Valinor]].<ref name=\"Flight\" />\n\n====Exile to Middle-earth and death====\n[[File:NOLANOS - La Quema de las Naves.jpg|thumb|''La Quema de las Naves'' by [[:Category:Images by NOLANOS|NOLANOS]]]]\nAs the year {{YT|1496|n}} wore on, Fëanor led the Noldor northward. By {{YT|1497|n}}, the host had reached the [[Helkaraxë]] and halted.<ref>{{MR|P2m}}</ref> There were not enough ships to carry all of the Noldor across the sea, so Fëanor and his sons seized the ships and departed. Upon arriving at [[Losgar]], the outlet of the Firth of Drengist in the land of [[Lammoth]], in the far west of [[Beleriand]], where Morgoth and Ungoliant had passed not long before, Fëanor decided to burn the ships and leave the followers of Fingolfin behind.<ref name=\"Flight\" /> As [[Arda]] was flat in those days, the remaining Noldor saw the flames and perceived that, if they were to reach Middle-earth, they had no choice but to cross the Helcaraxë. This they did under the leadership of Fingolfin, and suffered heavy losses along the way, which greatly added to the animosity they had for the [[House of Fëanor]].<ref name=\"Flight\" />\n[[File:Jenny Dolfen - Death of Feanor.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Death of Feanor'' by [[Jenny Dolfen]]]]\nLearning of the Noldor's arrival, Morgoth summoned his armies from his fortress of [[Angband]] and attacked Fëanor's encampment in [[Mithrim]]. This battle was called the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]] (\"Battle-under-Stars\"), for the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]] had not yet been made. The Noldor managed to win the battle and disperse Morgoth's armies. Fëanor, still in a great rage, pressed on toward Angband with his sons. He came upon the confines of [[Dor Daedeloth]], but was ambushed by a force of [[Balrogs]], with few Elves about him. He fought mightily, hewing his foes, even after receiving several wounds, but was bested by [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]], Lord of Balrogs. \n\nHis sons came upon the Balrogs with a great force of Elves, and were able to drive them off. However, as Fëanor was being carried off the battlefield, he knew his wounds were fatal. He was brought to the slopes of the [[Ered Wethrin]] where he saw from afar the peaks of [[Thangorodrim]]. He cursed Morgoth thrice, but with the eyes of death, he knew that the Elves, unaided, would never throw down the dark towers. At the moment of his death the passing of his fiery spirit reduced his body to ashes. He was the only person to die this way, for no death like his was ever seen or heard.<ref name=\"S|Return\">{{S|Return}}</ref>\n\nHis sons were still bound by the Oath to recover the Silmarils, which would determine many of the events of Middle-earth during the First Age.\n\nFëanor's spirit remained in the [[Halls of Mandos]].<ref name=\"S|Return\">{{S|Return}}</ref> It is said that he will return for [[Dagor Dagorath]], and will finally reclaim his beloved Silmarils and break them so [[Yavanna]] can use their light to restore the Two Trees.<ref name=\"Last\">{{WJ|Last}}, p. 247</ref>\n\n==Works==\n[[File:J.R.R.

In the [[Parma Eldalamberon 11|Gnomish Lexicon]], written around [[1917]], ''Fëanor'' is given as the [[Qenya]] cognate of [[Gnomish]] ''Fionor'' (\"Goblet Smith\"), but is mentioned with no apparent connection to the later Noldoli character.<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry ''Fionwë-Úrion''</ref> However, [[Tolkien]] used ''Fëanor'' in the narrative of the [[Lost Tales]] for the character.<ref>{{LT1|Index}}, entry \"Fëanor\"</ref> In the [[Noldorin]] phase, ''Fëanor'' is the original name while ''Fëanáro'' is the Qenya cognate.

However, Melko also speaks to Manwë, telling him that the Noldoli are stirring against the [[Valar]], and when Nólemë's embassy arrives, Manwë is displeased with both parties, and sends Melko back to [[Mandos]], and orders that the Noldoli leave their home upon [[Kôr]] and dwell elsewhere, lest their discontent spread among the other kindreds. <ref name=\"Theft\" />{{rp|140-143}}\n\nThe Noldoli relocate to the vale of [[Sirnúmen]] and remain there for a while, until the time of a great [[Samírien|feast]] held in [[Valimar|Valmar]], to which they fare along with the rest of the [[Eldar]]. During the feast, Melko and his accomplices travel to the emptied dwelling of the Noldoli and slay the guards they had left there, including Fëanor's father, [[Bruithwir]]. They plunder the treasury there, taking the most glorious gems, including the Silmarils. After this tragedy, the Noldoli are distraught, and Manwë grants them permission to return to their home at Kôr. However, some, Fëanor among them, choose to remain behind in [[Sirnúmen]]. There Fëanor broods, striving and failing to recreate the Silmarils, and sitting beside his father's tomb, his discontent growing until at last he fares to Kôr, speaking against the Valar and urging the Noldoli to leave Valinor.<ref name=\"Theft\">{{LT1|VI}}</ref>{{rp|143-150}} Soon afterwards, following Melko and [[Gwerlum]]'s destruction of the [[Two Trees of Valinor|Two Trees]], Fëanor persuades his people to arm themselves, follow him and [[Flight of the Noldor|leave Valinor]].<ref name=\"VII\">{{LT1|VII}}</ref>{{rp|162}}\n\nThere are key differences in this section of the story from later versions, but there are also similarities. For one, Bruithwir, rather than Finwë Nólemë, is Fëanor's father in ''Lost Tales''. However, the element of a close kinsman of Fëanor's being slain by Melko at their home in exile remains. Fëanor is still the creator of the Silmarils, and, angered at their loss and the loss of his father, still rallies his people to flee Valinor using the same rhetoric as in later versions.<ref>{{LT1|VIn}}, pp. 156-160</ref> \n\nIn the next portion of the tale, Fëanor leads the Noldoli into exile from Valinor. An inserted rider also describes him as initiating the [[First Kinslaying|Kinslaughter]] at [[Alqualondë|Kópas Alqalunten]] in a bid to steal the ships of the [[Solosimpi]]. The Noldoli suffered much loss at the crossing of the [[Helkaraksë]], and many blamed Fëanor bitterly for their plight. However, they at last succeeded in crossing into Middle-earth.<ref name=\"VII\" /> Fëanor's sons are first mentioned later in the tale, as having hidden a store of crystals in Sirnúmen, which were later used by Aulë in the making of the [[Ship of the Moon]] after the departure of the Noldoli.<ref>{{LT1|VIII}}, p. 192</ref> \n\nAccording to earlier outlines of ''The Book of Lost Tales'', the Noldoli spread out in the land of Hisilómë. Different outlines from around this time have different fates of Fëanor. In one, he is lost at the [[Lake Mithrim|Waters of Asgon]], sailing out to the [[Islanded Rock]] there in search of his jewels. In another, it is Nólemë that dies at [[Asgon]], and Fëanor, rather than his son (as in later versions, and the other outline), leads a host against Melko, and is captured and tormented. In later outlines, the Noldoli also reach [[Hisilómë]], and Fëanor drowns in the Waters of Mithrim. In this version, Maidros, son of Fëanor, is the one to lead a host against Melko and be captured.<ref>{{LT1|X}}</ref> While Fëanor's manner of death here is different from that in the published Silmarillion, it mirrors it in that he dies soon after leading the Noldoli out of [[Middle-earth]], and is survived by his sons and his people.\n\n====Story of Wéland/Fëanor====\nThere exists a compilation of texts called the ''[[Early Runic Documents]]'', contemporary with ''The Book of Lost Tales'', one of which identifies Fëanor with the legendary Germanic smith called [[wikipedia:Wayland the Smith|Wayland]]. That story is placed during the wars of the Elves with [[Melko]].\n\nIn that text, Fëanor was captured by a man called [[Niðad]],<ref group=\"note\">In the text as originally written, ''Niðad'' was a replacement for ''Melko'', and the ''Niaroth'' for ''Orcs''.</ref> King of the [[Niaroth]]. However, Fëanor killed Niðad's sons<ref group=\"note\">In the original text, Fëanor killed Melko's \"captain of orcs\", instead of Niðad's sons.</ref> and managed to escape by crafting artificial wings for himself; he also made love to the king's daughter [[Beaduhilde]] and fled with her, but ultimately lost her in the woods.\n\nEventually Beaduhilde (who was now pregnant) forgave Fëanor, and in spite of her father's wrath at her pregnancy, she still managed to obtain Niðad's blessing upon her son.<ref>{{PE|15}}, \"[[Early Runic Documents]]\", ''ER1f: Sixth and seventh pages'', p. 97</ref> For more information, see [[Fëanor#Inspiration|Inspiration]].\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Rings of Power (TV series) - Fëanor's hammer.webp|right|150px|thumb|Fëanor's hammer in [[Celebrimbor|Celebrimbor's]] workshop in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power|The Rings of Power]]''.]]\n'''2022: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'', Season One:'''\n:'''Episode 2: ''[[Adrift]]'':'''\n::As [[Elrond]] enters [[Celebrimbor|Celebrimbor's]] workshop, Celebrimbor points out many artifacts he possesses, including Fëanor's hammer, the very device that Fëanor used to wrought the [[Silmarils]] themselves.\n\n:'''Episode 8: ''[[Alloyed]]'':'''\n::Upon attempting to forge a \"crown\" of power, Celebrimbor uses Fëanor's hammer over all of his other hammers.\n\n{{references|notes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Feanor}}\n\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n|race=noldor\n|house=[[House of Finwë]]\n|born={{YT|1169}}\n|died={{YT|1497}}\n}}\n{{seq\n|prev=[[Finwë]]\n|list=2nd [[King of the Noldor]]\n|dates={{YT|1495}} - {{YT|1496|n}} ''(disputed by [[Fingolfin]])''\n|next=[[Finarfin]]\n}}\n{{seq\n|pvac=None\n|prev=Title established\n|list=1st [[High King of the Noldor|King of the Noldor]] in exile\n|dates={{YT|1496}} - {{YT|1497|n}} ''(disputed by [[Fingolfin]])''\n|next=[[Fingolfin]] <small>''(disputed by [[Maedhros]])''</small>\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n[[Category:Calaquendi]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:House of Fëanor| ]]\n[[Category:House of Finwë]]\n[[Category:Noldor]]\n[[Category:Noldorin names]]\n[[Category:Qenya names]]\n[[Category:Rulers in Aman]]\n[[Category:Rulers in Beleriand]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n[[Category:Smiths]]\n[[de:Feanor]]\n[[fi:Fëanor]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/elfes/noldor/feanor]]"}}}
