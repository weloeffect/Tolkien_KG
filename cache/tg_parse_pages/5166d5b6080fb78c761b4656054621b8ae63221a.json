This scene was extended in the latter edition.\n\n==Synopsis==\nA band of [[Uruk-hai]] run across the plains of [[Rohan]]. They are carrying [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], who were [[The Breaking of the Fellowship (scene)|taken prisoner]] by the Uruk-hai at [[Parth Galen]]. Pippin tries to rouse Merry who is unconscious. The Uruk-hai are stopped by a company of [[orcs]] who urge them to quickly deliver the [[Hobbits]] to [[Saruman]]. \n\nUnable to wake Merry, Pippin tells the Uruk-hai that his friend is sick; they proceed to give Merry \"some medicine\" consisting of a brown liquid. This rouses Merry who tells Pippin that he is fine and that he is not hurt. \n\nOne of the Uruk-hai sniffs the air and tells the others he can smell \"Man-flesh\". They realise that their trail has been picked up and they quickly hurry on after stopping. Pippin understands that it is likely [[Aragorn]] who is tracking them, and so he discreetly tears the leaf-shaped brooch tying his [[Elven cloaks|Elven cloak]] using his mouth and drops it on the floor, hoping to leave a token for Aragorn to know he is on the right trail. \n\n==Differences==\n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers scenes|04]]"}}}
