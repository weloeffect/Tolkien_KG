She was the daughter of [[Orodreth]], the ruler of [[Nargothrond]], and the sister of [[Gil-galad]].<ref name=Find/>\n\n== History ==\nFinduilas lived in Nargothrond with her father and brother under the rule of [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]]. She was betrothed to [[Gwindor]], who named her '''Faelivrin''', which meant \"Gleam of the Sun on the [[Pools of Ivrin]]\".<ref name=\"CH10\">{{CH|10}}</ref> \n[[File:Elena Kukanova - Nargothrond - Turin and Finduilas.jpg|thumb|150px|left|''Nargothrond - Turin and Finduilas'' by [[Elena Kukanova]]]]\nHer betrothed was captured in {{FA|472}} during the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad|Battle of Unnumbered Tears]] by [[Morgoth]],<ref>{{GA|227}}</ref> but he returned in {{FA|490|n}} with a companion<ref>{{GA|267}}</ref> who called himself ''[[Agarwaen]], son of [[Úmarth]]'' (\"Bloodstained, son of the Cursed\"). Unknown to Finduilas, this was actually [[Túrin]] son of [[Húrin]].\n\nDespite her old feelings for Gwindor, who was now mutilated, Finduilas fell in love with noble Túrin who became an influential warrior of Nargothrond.  Túrin failed to notice her feelings, she reminded him of [[Lalaith]], the sister he lost in childhood. Gwindor realized that Finduilas had fallen in love with Túrin, and revealed his name to her in an attempt to discourage her pursuit.<ref name=\"CH10\"/>\n\nAt the [[Sack of Nargothrond]] by [[Glaurung]], Finduilas was captured. Gwindor was slain after ordering Túrin to protect Finduilas as only she could save him from his fate; however he was entranced by the dragon, and he could not hear Finduilas' cries as she was being dragged past him by the [[Orcs]] as a captive for [[Angband]].<ref>{{CH|11}}</ref> \n\nDue to Glaurung's deceit, Túrin abandoned Finduilas and instead went to [[Hithlum]] in search for his kin. When the Orcs were waylaid by the [[Haladin]] of [[Brethil]] at the [[Crossings of Teiglin]] they killed all their captives, pinning Finduilas to a tree with a spear. \n\nBy this time, Túrin had regained his senses, and the Haladin buried her in a mound they called ''[[Haudh-en-Elleth]]'' (\"Mound of the Elf-maiden\").<ref>{{CH|13}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{Pronounce|Finduilas.mp3|Ardamir}}\nThe name ''Finduilas'' is a [[Sindarin]] name.

When [[Túrin]] joined their people, he usually helped her father in the fight against the [[Orcs]], so she could see him often. She became captivated by Túrin's hidden sadness, but as he had a hardened heart, she wept in secret for him, \"and she grew so pale that folk marvelled at the whiteness and delicacy of her face and her bright eyes that shone therein\". When he later gained fame among the Rodothlim, her love for him grew, and she always defended him when people murmured against him. He treated her with courtesy, saying he had found a fair sister in the lands of the Gnomes.<ref name=Turambar>{{LT2|II}}</ref>{{rp|82–3}}\n\nWhen [[Melko]] attacked the Rodothlim with a great army and the dragon [[Glorund]], Túrin came to Galweg's place in the caves, and found him dead. Failivrin sought confort in his arms and he realized his loved for her. However, the place was attacked by Orcs, and only Túrin and [[Flinding]] were there to protect her. After Flinding's death, Túrin was taken out by Glorund's breath and paralyzed by its [[Magic|enchanting]] eyes. Thus, when Failivring was captured and carried out in front of him, she cried to him: \"''O Túrin Mormakil, where is thy heart; O my beloved, wherefore dost thou forsake me?''\". Hearing her cry, Túrin almost broke the enchantment, but Glorund stopped him and talked to him, making him to believe his family was in danger. Against all wisdom and his own heart, Túrin forsook Failivrin, and her sad fate was never known.<ref name=Turambar/>{{rp|84–7}}\n\nIt is notable that the element of Failivrin already appears in the earliest outlines of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] for the story of Túrin.<ref>{{LT2|IIn}}, p. 138</ref> As can be read above, she is not given a conclusion for her story, nor she is anyway related to the characters of Orodreth and Flinding (later [[Gwindor]]) as in later narratives.\n{{references|notes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Finduilas}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Children of Húrin]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:House of Finarfin]]\n[[Category:Moriquendi]]\n[[Category:Noldor]]\n[[Category:Noldorin names]]\n[[Category:Pronounced articles]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n[[de:Finduilas aus Nargothrond]]\n[[fi:Finduilas (haltia)]]\n[[fr:/encyclo/personnages/elfes/noldor/finduilas]]"}}}
