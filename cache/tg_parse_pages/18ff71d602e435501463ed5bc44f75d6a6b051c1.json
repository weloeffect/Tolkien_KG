Ratbag was invented for ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]'' by [[Warner Bros.]] and he was portrayed by [[Phillip LaMarr]].\n\n==History==\nOutside of the western side of [[Durthang]], Ratbag was tied to a pole, being left to rot by his captain, \"Goroth Caragor Tamer\". After some time had passed, the ranger known only as Talion the Gravewalker is coaxed over and strikes a deal with the uruk. If Talion helped him to become a Warchief, then he will draw out the [[Black Hand|Black Hand of Sauron]]. In addition, Ratbag swore that every uruk beneath his command will hinder Talion's quest. Despite this, however, he cannot speak for the other Warchiefs.\n\nEventually, after all of the other Warchiefs are killed, the \"Hammer of Sauron\" arrives, skeptical that out all the Warchiefs, Ratbag was the only one left alive, Who claims that the other Warchiefs perished in battle. Unfortunately for Ratbag, the \"Hammer of Sauron\" flings Ratbag away with his mace, seemingly killing him.\n\nIt is revealed much later (in [[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]]) that Ratbag was alive and made an ally of the [[Olog-hai|Olog]] Az-Harto, whom he calls \"Ranger\". Somehow, the two of them managed to take over the fortress of Sharkburz in [[Nurn]]. At the same time, they forged a legend of themselves as a two-headed [[Trolls|troll]] called \"[[Etten|The Etten]]\".\n\n==Etymology==\n''Ratbag'' is an English word meaning \"a despicable person\".\n\nThe name could have also taken inspiration from the two Orcs [[Shagrat]] and [[Gorbag]].\n\n==Other versions==\nIn an alpha gameplay video, Ratbag was originally an [[Orcs|uruk]] called '''Ratbag the Meat Hoarder''' who [[Talion]] had to dominate in order to find out the location of a Warchief.\n\nThere is an easter egg [[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]] where if Talion does not obtain a Nemesis by the time of the assault on [[Ephel Dúath|Ered Glamhoth]], then Ratbag the Coward would act as a stand-in for a Nemesis. Curiously, this version of Ratbag was voiced by [[William Dwight Schultz]] rather than [[Phillip LaMarr]].\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Middle-earth: Shadow (video game series) characters]]\n[[Category:Orcs from adaptations]]"}}}
