This scene was not included in the theatrical release of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''.\n{{title}}\n==Synopsis==\n[[Treebeard]] leads the company led by [[Gandalf]] to [[Orthanc]], where [[Saruman]] is held. Saruman goads [[Théoden]] by asking for peace. Gandalf asks him for information about when and where [[Sauron]] will begin his attack on [[Middle-earth]]. Saruman reveals the [[Palantíri|palantír]], stating that something ''festers'' in the heart of Middle-earth which Gandalf has failed to see. He then mocks [[Aragorn]] by saying he will never become [[King of Gondor]], and that Gandalf ''\"doesn't hesitate to sacrifice those closest to him\"''. He asks Gandalf what words of comfort he gave [[Frodo Baggins|the halfling]] before sending him to his doom. All are visibly shaken by the words of Saruman, and [[Gimli]] is ready to shoot him, however Gandalf has mercy on him and asks him to come down. Insulted by this, Saruman tries to attack Gandalf. As a result, Gandalf destroys Saruman's staff. \n\n[[Gríma]] appears from behind Saruman, and [[Théoden]] asks him to return and be free. Saruman insults them both, and tells Gandalf he will tell him where Sauron will strike if the company withdraws from Orthanc. In rage, Gríma stabs him, and [[Legolas]] shoots Gríma, but too late, as Saruman falls from the top of Orthanc and lands on the spike of a large wheel. The palantír falls from his robes and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] picks it out of the water. Gandalf quickly takes it from him. \n\n==Differences==\nWhile in the books, Gríma does indeed kill Saruman, this happens in [[the Shire]] during its [[Battle of Bywater|scouring]]<ref name=RKScouring>{{RK|Scouring}}, p. 1020</ref> rather than at Orthanc. Instead, Saruman is imprisoned in Orthanc by Treebeard. He is released after the [[Downfall of Barad-dûr|fall of Barad-dûr]] on [[15 August]] , {{TA|3019}}<ref name=AppChief>{{App|Chief}}, p. 1095</ref> and journeys towards the Shire, where he spent the last part of his life leading [[Ruffians]] and disrupting the Shire.<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref> \n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King scenes|04]]"}}}
