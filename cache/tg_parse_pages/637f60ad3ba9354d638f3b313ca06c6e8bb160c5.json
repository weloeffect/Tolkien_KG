Next came the inner door, tall and fashioned of polished metal, which was opened by unseen means. Inside, rows of tall pillars, carved monoliths of black marble crowned with capitals exhibiting figures of beasts and leaves, upheld the vaulted ceiling of gold and flowing traceries. Flanking the pillars were spacious aisles lit by deep windows and between the pillars were tall images of long-dead kings made of cold stone.<ref name=MT/>\n\nAt the far end of the hall was a dais of many steps which supported a high throne with a marble canopy shaped like a crowned helm.
