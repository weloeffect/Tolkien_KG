She was the most skilfull singer of [[Valinor]], but she used to visit [[Middle-earth]] to fill the silence and teach the birds. \n\nDuring the [[Great Journey]], the [[Teleri]] lingered in [[East Beleriand]] while the [[Noldor]] were [[Neldoreth|further to the west]]. [[Elwë]], the leader of the Teleri while visiting his friend [[Finwë]] of the Noldor, was lost in the forest of [[Nan Elmoth]] and saw Melian dancing. When they saw each other, they remained immobile for the following ages in an ecstatic enchantment. His followers could not find him, so his leadership was taken by [[Olwë]].\n\nIn the later years, Elwë was known in [[Sindarin]] as ''Elu Thingol''. He and Melian became the King and Queen of the Sindar, founding the kingdom of [[Doriath]], the only place in Middle-earth where there was glimpse of the [[Light of Valinor]].\n\n==External links==\n* [http://entmoot.tolkientrail.com/showthread.php?t=7565 Chapter discussion at Entmoot.com]\n* [http://forum.barrowdowns.com/showthread.php?t=13423 Chapter discussion at BarrowDowns.com]\n\n[[fr:tolkien/resumes/silm/qs4]]\n[[fi:Thingol ja Melian (Silmarillion)]]"}}}
