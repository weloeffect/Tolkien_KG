She is the leader of the [[Tribesmen of Núrn]].\n\nThe Tribesmen are the descendants of [[Corsairs of Umbar|Corsair]] Raiders who settled the Coast of the [[Sea of Núrnen]] after the armies of [[Gondor]] withdrew hundreds of years ago. In her youth, Lady Marwen was a respected and feared warrior throughout the Southern region of [[Mordor]] before she settled down to lead her people. Since the return of [[Sauron]] and the Black Captains she searched for any means to hold back the dark tide of war.\n\nThe character is voiced by [[Claudia Black]]\n\n==Events of Shadow of Mordor==\nWhen Marwen sought the aid of [[Saruman]] regarding the threat of [[Sauron]], she became possessed by him and sent her daughter, Lithariel, to find [[Celebrimbor]]. She uses prophetic powers to guide [[Talion]] and Celebrimbor to one of Celebrimbor's relics and advises them to use Celebrimbor's powers to take control of an army of [[Uruk-hai|Uruks]], and use them to lead an assault against Sauron.\nTalion eventually realized that Marwen was possessed, resulting in Saruman's attempt to remove Celebrimbor from Talion's body to fail as Lithariel frees her from his possession by breaking the staff, saving Talion and Celebrimbor. However, Talion still carries out Saruman's plan, and leads his army of mind-controlled orcs in an assault against the Black Hand's stronghold at Ered Glamhoth.\nAs the Black Hand of Sauron later attacks Nurnen and leaves smoking ruins in his wake, it is assumed that Lady Marwen and Lithariel were forced to flee, were captured or killed in the resulting attack.\n==Etymology==\n'''''Marwen''''' likely means \"Dwelling Maiden\" in [[Quenya]], being a compound of ''[[Mar]]-'' (\"dwell\") and ''[[gwenn]]'' (\"maiden\"). \n[[Category:Men from adaptations]]\n[[Category:Middle-earth: Shadow (video game series) characters]]"}}}
