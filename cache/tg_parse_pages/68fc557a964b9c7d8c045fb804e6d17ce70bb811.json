He also writes that he thinks [[Pauline Baynes]]'s ''Hobbit'' poster map is better than ''A Map of Middle-earth''; he is glad Elgar liked the [[The Chronicles of Narnia|Narnia]] books, although he himself is not fond of them; and he discusses the naming of pets after [[Hobbits]] (commenting that [[Hilary Tolkien|Hilary]] has a dog which is called [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] when being good, and Baggins when being bad).<ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 758</ref>\n*'''Publication:''' Descriptions of the letter appeared in ''[[Sotheby's English Literature and English History 6-7 December 1984]]'' and ''[[The J.R.R.

These stories are deservedly very popular; but since you ask if <u>I</u> like them I am afraid the answer is <u>No</u>. I do <u>not</u> like 'allegory', and least of all religious allegory of this kind. But that is a difference of taste which we both recognized and did not interfere with our friendship.\"<ref>Quoted in \"Disparaging Narnia: Reconsidering Tolkien's View of ''The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe''\" by Josh B.
