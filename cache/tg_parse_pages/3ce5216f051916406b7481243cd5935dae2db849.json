Tolkien]]'s works could observe several ambiguously '''racist and race-based elements'''; these go further into stereotyping or the symbolism of good versus evil in Tolkien's [[legendarium]]. Though the latter is the more established and valid area of study, as early as the first edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' the topic of \"race\" has been discussed, including by [[C.S. Lewis]].<ref>[[C.S. Lewis]], ''[[The Dethronement of Power]]''</ref>\n\nTolkien denounced Hitler,<ref name=\"l45\">{{L|45}}</ref> Nazi beliefs, \"race-doctrine\",<ref name=\"l29\">{{L|29}}</ref> and apartheid,<ref>{{L|61}}</ref> and praised the Jews, calling them a \"gifted people\"<ref name=\"l30\">{{L|30}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[The Lord of the Rings Foreword|Foreword]] to the revised edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien cautioned strongly against viewing it as an allegory, stating that he cordially disliked allegory.<ref>{{FR|Foreword}}</ref> He reiterated this sentiment in response to suggestions of racial allegory in his works.<ref name=\"l29\" /> Therefore, his intentions should be viewed as being set aside from the social-political domain and entirely focused within a fantasy fiction context.  \n\nChristine Chism mentions the issue of racism in the ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia: Scholarship and Critical Assessment|J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia]]'', where she distinguishes accusations as falling into three categories: intentional racism, unconscious Eurocentric bias, and an evolution from latent racism in Tolkien's early work to a conscious rejection of racist tendencies in his late work.<ref>Christine Chism, \"Race and Ethnicity in Tolkien's Works\" In [[Michael Drout|Drout, Michael]] (ed.).

For example, [[Gollum]]'s description of the [[Haradrim]], \"''Not nice; very cruel wicked [[Men]] they look. Almost as bad as [[Orcs]], and much bigger''\"<ref>{{RK|Gate}}, p. 646</ref> has been described as \"stereotypical and reflective of colonial attitudes\". Sandra Straubhaar points out in ''[[Tolkien and the Invention of Myth]]'' that Gollum is known for having a hatred for others and his opinions should not be taken as necessarily representative of Tolkien's views.<ref>[[Jane Chance]], ''[[Tolkien and the Invention of Myth]]''</ref>\n===Racial ambiguity of characters===\nAs Tolkien's legendarium is set in a fictional world, race does not work the same as in our [[Primary World]]. There are different races (eg. [[Dwarves]] and [[Elves]]) and groups within these (eg. [[Gondorians]] and Haradrim). None of these groups are a one-to-one match to any race in our world. Except for the few situations in which Tolkien explicitly states it, any claims as to the real-world race that a character or ([[Arda]]) race is based on is reader interpretation and cannot be definitively said to have been a result of racism, intentional or not.\n\nOften the only clues we have to go on for which (real-world) race a character or race is most similar to or based upon, are short, often metaphorical descriptions that are subject to debate. For example, [[Samwise Gamgee]] is twice referred to as having \"brown hands\",<ref>{{TT|Stairs}}</ref><ref>{{RK|Tower}}</ref> leading some to argue that Sam is \"non-white\".<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=https://askmiddlearth.tumblr.com/post/106609134600/sam-gamgees-brown-hands|articlename=Sam Gamgee’s Brown Hands|website=[https://askmiddlearth.tumblr.com Ask About Middle-Earth]}}</ref>\n\n==Perceived racism in Tolkien's works==<!-- These are not to be taken as definite. This list cites claims pointed out by critics, right or wrong, and can be 'countered'. -->\n===Men===\n[[Image:John Howe - Easterlings.jpg|thumb|''Easterlings'' by [[John Howe]]]]\nOne potentially racist element in [[Middle-earth]] is that the majority of the [[Men]] who serve [[Sauron]] are the dark-skinned peoples of the [[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterling]]s and [[Southrons]]. They come from the South and East of Middle-earth, corresponding with Asia and Africa in the loose connection between Middle-earth geography and that of the real world.\n\nThe [[Easterlings]] are aligned with [[Morgoth]] or Sauron with the exception of [[Bór]]'s folk. They are described as being of fairly dark skin complexion, swarthy and exceedingly cruel. The Southrons (or Haradrim) are described as black-skinned, cruel and evil. \n\nIn some cases, people having the slightest blood relation to enemies, like [[Freca]] and [[Wulf]], who are related to the [[Dunlendings]], are presented as evil themselves,<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref> further suggesting the idea that evilness is hereditary or inherent to the race. Some of these are also called \"swarthy\" (dark). [[Bill Ferny]] is said to be swarthy,<ref>{{FR|Strider}} p. 165</ref> however the rest of the mostly benign and hearty [[Men of Bree]] are also descended from Dunlendings.<ref>{{App|Men}}</ref>\n\nWhile the Easterlings and the Haradrim are dark-skinned people in the service of the Enemy, the [[Woses]] are primitive, small, and alien compared to other peoples (their chief [[Ghân-buri-Ghân]] only wears a grass skirt) yet they are valuable allies. While Tolkien does not mention their skin colour, they were considered monsters by the [[Rohirrim]] who hunted them as animals, which the narrative explicitly condemns. However, in the [[First Age]] they were counted as [[Edain]], or noble Men, and were allies of the Elves.<ref>{{UT|Druedain}}</ref>\n\nHowever, not all enemies are non-white. Noteworthy examples are [[Gríma]], and at least three of the [[Nazgûl]]. Indeed, while during the time frame of the [[War of the Ring]], those enslaved and serving Sauron were darker skinned people from the South and East, during the history of Middle-earth many of the white races of man and even some Elves were fooled and coerced by the Enemy.\n\nIn the War of the Ring, the human enemies are not truly evil, since they are described as deceived, enslaved, or exploited. They are portrayed in a much more sympathetic light when Sam sees a dead warrior of [[Harad]] and wonders if he was truly evil, or whether the warrior was deceived or coerced to go to war. The Dunlendings are persuaded by [[Saruman]] to attack [[Rohan]], playing on their grievances due to [[Gondor]] giving what they considered their land to the [[Éothéod]], the ancestors of the Rohirrim. Earlier, Sauron persuaded their ancestors to fight against the [[Númenóreans]], the cause of their relocation from forests into the hills. Additionally, after the War of the Ring, King [[Aragorn|Elessar]] pardoned and made peace with the Easterlings and Haradrim.<ref>{{RK|Steward}}, p. 968</ref>\n\nTolkien also wrote that the [[Blue Wizards]] were sent into the South and East lands to spread dissent and resistance against Sauron.<ref>{{PM|Last}}, pp. 384-5</ref> While he wrote on one occasion (as given in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'') that they failed, on another occasion (as given in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'') he wrote that they were successful, making Sauron's hold on these lands throughout the centuries significantly weaker than it should have been. This prevented Sauron from overwhelming the West with his armies and ultimately contributed to his defeat in the War of the Ring. This means that Southrons and Easterlings resisting Sauron were meant to exist, but their stories remain untold.\n===Orcs===\n[[File:Abe Papakhian - Orcs and Uruks.jpg|right|thumb|''The Fighting Uruk-hai & the Orcs of [[Barad-dûr|Lugburz]]'' by [[:Category:Images by Abe Papakhian|Abe Papakhian]]]]\nStephen Shapiro, a cultural studies expert, has compared the small group of protagonists (the [[Fellowship of the Ring]]) against hordes of foreign enemies as representative of the long history of Anglo-European's fear of non-Europeans.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://www.scotsman.com/arts-and-culture/film-and-tv/lord-of-the-rings-labelled-racist-2461845|articlename=Lord of the Rings labelled racist|dated=14 December 2002|website=[https://www.scotsman.com/ The Scotsman]|accessed=26 February 2024}}</ref>\n\nOf the Orcs, the [[Uruk-Hai]] are described as \"black\"<ref>{{FR|Bridge}}, p. 329</ref>, and a smaller Orc, a tracker, is described as \"black-skinned\".<ref>{{RK|Shadow}}, p. 924</ref> All Orcs are often described as \"slant-eyed\"<ref>{{TT|Uruk}}, p. 451</ref>, and the Uruk-Hai at least refer to the Rohirrim as '[[whiteskins]]'.<ref name=\"TT|Uruk\">{{TT|Uruk}}</ref> Tolkien described Orcs as ''\"...squat, broad, flat-nosed, sallow-skinned, with wide mouths and slant eyes; in fact degraded and repulsive versions of the (to Europeans) least lovely Mongol-types\"''<ref name=\"l210\">{{L|210}}</ref>\n\nWhile Tolkien's statement comparing Orcs to the \"Mongol-types\" may be interpreted as racist, he does put a disclaimer, \"(to Europeans)\" before \"least lovely\", recognizing Western cultural bias and also pointing out that they were \"degraded and repulsive versions\" of \"Mongol-types\", not actual \"Mongol-types\". Additionally, this was in a time period where racial stereotypes of Mongols were more acceptable and less questioned, so Tolkien's use of the phrase \"Mongol-types\" may have just been a descriptor, separate from any views he may have held on Mongolia or Mongols. It is worth noting that some Orcs use curved (synonymously described as \"crooked\" or \"bent\") swords which he calls \"[[Scimitar|scimitars]]\", which is an English word used to describe swords that are historically associated with the Middle East.<ref>{{TT|Departure}}</ref>\n\nOrcs, however, are not Men. Unlike the wicked Men who serve the Enemy, who might have been enslaved or beguiled, Orcs are portrayed as irredeemably evil, or at least having a redemption outside the scope of the narrative. The [[Orcs/Origin|origin of Orcs]] is not clear, but they may be products of Morgoth's sorcery or the descendants of tortured and ruined Elves or Men. Regardless of their origins, they are not presented as a natural race.<ref>{{S|3}}</ref>\n===Dwarves as Jews===\n[[File:Henning Janssen - The Long Lost Treasure Casatshok.jpg|thumb|''The Long Lost Treasure Casatshok'' by [[Henning Janssen]]]]\n{{Seealso|#Nazism and Judaism}}Tolkien himself compared Dwarves to Jews: \n\n{{blockquote|The dwarves of course are quite obviously... couldn't you say that in many ways they remind you of the Jews?

Both Dwarves and Jews were \"at once natives and aliens in their habitations, speaking the languages of the country, but with an accent due to their own private tongue…\"<ref>{{L|176}}</ref>\n[[File:Ephraim Moses Lilien - Learning Talmud.jpg|thumb|left|''The Talmud students'' by [[Wikipedia:Ephraim Moses Lilien|Ephraim Moses Lilien]] (1915). It is possible to draw a connection between some typical characteristics of the Orthodox Jews, such as the beards, with traditional depictions of the Dwarves (more of an origin in Norse mythology).]]\nRebecca Brackman notes that although Tolkien was not a conscious antisemite, he was influenced by the popular perception towards the Jews, including by tropes and stereotypes considered \"antisemitic\" today; such tropes were found in classical and contemporary works including ''The Merchant of Venice'' or ''Oliver Twist'', that portrayed Jewish characters as greedy,<ref group=note>One of the weaknesses of the Dwarves was their greed for [[gold]] and other riches, amplified by the [[Seven Rings]]. Cf. {{S|Rings}}</ref> alien, and as cowardly comical reliefs. The Dwarves in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' display such traits at several points in the story and are portrayed as comical, unheroic, alien, and functioning under their own interests (\"dwarves are not heroes, but calculating folk with a great idea of the value of [[money]]\"<ref>{{H|12}}</ref>).<ref name=\"brackman\">Brackmann, Rebecca ([[2010]]) \"[https://dc.swosu.edu/mythlore/vol28/iss3/ 'Dwarves are Not Heroes': Antisemitism and the Dwarves in J.R.R. Tolkien's Writing]\", [[Mythlore]]: A Journal of J.R.R. Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, Charles Williams, and Mythopoeic Literature: Vol. 28: No. 3, Article 7</ref>\n\nIn his later works, Tolkien paints a mostly positive picture of the Dwarves (with [[Gimli]] as a prime example of brave and honourable Dwarf), and stating that \"few Dwarves ever served the enemy willingly\", contrary to the tales of Men.<ref name=\"Other\">{{App|Other}}</ref> In his real life he made explicitly positive statements about the Jewish people.<ref name=\"l30\" />\n\n===Númenóreans===\n<!--Expand, sourcing-->\n[[File:Turner Mohan - Tar-Míriel.jpg|thumb|''Tar-Míriel'' by [[:Category:Images by Turner Mohan|Turner Mohan]]]]\nTolkien has divine beings blessing or gifting peoples or persons and their descendants, having thus the concept of the chosen people who differ from others — in Tolkien's case, the [[Dúnedain]] (literally \"Men of the West\") of [[Númenor]]. It should be also noted that according to Theosophy, Ariosophy and Nazism, the Aryan race is supposedly descended from [[Wikipedia:Atlantis|Atlantis]].<ref>Alfred Rosenberg, ''[[Wikipedia:The Myth of the Twentieth Century|The Myth of the Twentieth Century]]''</ref>\n\nAlthough gifted, many of Tolkien's Númenóreans are evil. In the [[The Lord of the Rings Appendices|Appendices]] to ''[[The Return of the King]],'' Númenórean fleets sail to Middle-earth, where they conquer and subjugate native peoples in what may be a commentary on European imperialism. The Númenóreans ultimately cause their own downfall by following the teachings of Morgoth, conducting human sacrifices, and making war on [[Valinor]]. At least three of the Nazgûl are Númenóreans.\n===Light vs. Dark===\nSome critics have declared that there is racism in Tolkien's works through his use of words such as \"light\" and \"white\" vs. \"dark\" or \"black\". For instance, in [[2002]], John Yatt in ''The Guardian'' wrote: \"White men are good, 'dark' men are bad, orcs are worst of all.\"<ref>{{webcite|author=John Yatt|articleurl=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/dec/02/jrrtolkien.lordoftherings|articlename=Wraiths and race|dated=2 December 2002|website=[https://www.theguardia.com/us The Guardian]|accessed=26 February 2024}}\n</ref> Other critics disagree with such clear-cut generalizations of Tolkien's \"white\" and \"dark\" men into good and bad.\n\nThe whole of Tolkien's legendarium contains a conflict between \"light\" ([[Two Trees of Valinor|The Trees]], the [[Silmarils]]) and \"darkness\" (the literal absence of light). Morgoth's standard was ''\"sable unblazoned\"'' (that is, plain black).<ref>{{S|18}}</ref> ''\"[[Mordor]]\"'' means \"black land\" in [[Sindarin]].<ref>{{L|144}}</ref> If one were to analyse this through a racial lens, the ongoing clash may be interpreted as containing racial symbolism of light skinned versus dark skinned peoples, although [[Eöl]], father of [[Maeglin]] was known as the Dark Elf,<ref>{{S|Maeglin}}</ref> and the [[Moriquendi]] were called the Elves of Darkness. Both these terms refer to remaining outside the light of the two trees, not to skin tone. The [[Black Númenóreans]] are likewise named because of the colour of their allegiance to Sauron and their heraldry, not their skin tone. Considering this, Tolkien's assignment of Good and Evil to \"light\" and \"dark\" cannot simply be dismissed as racial undertones within the broader narrative. \n\nAs [[Tom Shippey]] points out, it is important to view the context behind the writing. Tolkien wrote as if he were writing a medieval text from the perspective of a pre-scientific medieval people.\n{{blockquote|The mention in ‘The Battle of the Pelennor Fields’ of ‘black men like half-trolls’ certainly sounds racist. I think I would say here that Tolkien at this point is trying to write like a medieval chronicler, and when medieval Europeans first encountered sub-Saharan Africans, they were genuinely confused about them, and rather frightened. As Tolkien pointed out in his early scholarly works, the ancient English seemed to have a belief in fire-demons, who naturally enough had skin like soot – their word for them, ‘harwan’, is related to Latin ‘carbo’, ‘soot,’ or carbon. An Anglo-Saxon meeting an African for the first time might then really wonder (for a moment, from a distance) whether this was a demon from his own mythology. This doesn’t mean that Tolkien shared the mythology, or the mistake.<ref name=fimi/>|Tom Shippey}}\n\nWhite is also not always associated with good. Noteworthy examples are [[Gríma]], [[Gollum]], and at least two of the Nazgûl. [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]] and the [[ruffians]] are white-skinned characters who ravage and take over [[the Shire]]. Saruman the White and his symbol the [[White Hand]] are associated with evil and corruption. Orcs are described as \"sallow\" (pale).<ref name=\"l210\" /> Similarly, black is not only associated with evil as Gondor uses a black standard bearing the [[White Tree of Gondor|White Tree]], and the [[Guards of the Citadel]] of [[Minas Tirith]] wore black chain mail. In [[The Peoples of Middle-earth|''The Peoples of Middle-earth'']], three Númenórean ships are followed by a [[Ship of the Dark|ship with black sails]]. One of the mariners explains to a native of Middle-earth, scared that the black sails indicate doom, that the blackness is in fact a thing of beauty, the night sky of [[Varda|Elbereth]] (who kindled the stars). Indeed, Tolkien states that one of Morgoth's (literally, the ''Black Enemy'') victories was in associating darkness and night with fear and evil.\n\nThe symbolism of light as good and dark as evil is ever-present in much of literature, modern and historical. Light vs. dark is a prehistoric dichotomy present in a great many cultures, Western and otherwise. A common theme, it is seen in religion from all parts of the world,<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/light-and-darkness|articlename=Light and Darkness|dated=|website=|accessed=29 February 2024}}</ref> including [[Christianity]] (John 8:12 Jesus Christ said, \"I am the Light of the World, Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.\")<ref>{{webcite|author=Lori Braman|articleurl=https://knowledge.e.southern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1051&context=senior_research|articlename=The Silmarillion: Tolkien's Guise for Christian Realism|dated=2003|website=|accessed=29 February 2024}}</ref>\n===Moral geography===\n[[File:John Magoun, Moral Geography of Middle-earth.png|right|thumb|Moral geography of Middle-earth according to John Magoun]]\nTolkien wrote that [[Arda]] was not a different fantasy universe but a fictional era in Earth's history.<ref>{{L|183}}</ref> This has led to criticisms with some similarities noticed between the peoples in different regions of Middle-earth and their corresponding Earth location. It has also been pointed out that [[Aman]], the Blessed Realm, is the westernmost part of Arda which areas in the South and East are often associated with evil.<ref>John Magoun, ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia: Scholarship and Critical Assessment]]''</ref>\n\nIt should be noted that Tolkien only made precise ''geographic'' correspondences of [[Third Age]] Middle-earth locations to those in the real world. For example, [[Hobbiton]] was at the latitude of [[Oxford]].<ref name=\"l294\">{{L|294}}</ref> The Shire was based upon, but ''was not actually'' rural England, since \"the lands [have] changed\" since then.<ref name=\"hobbits\" /> Tolkien made no precise correspondences regarding the ''peoples'' concerned. Though the [[Hobbits]] were based upon rural English folk, they were not literally ancient Englishmen. He never said that Harad was Africa, nor the Eastlands Asia, nor their inhabitants' ancestors of Africans or Asians. \n\nThe ''Daily Telegraph Magazine'' suggested in a draft of an article that North was \"a sacred direction\" for Tolkien. He responded to this admitting that he did have an affection for it as he (and most of his ancestors) were from North-west Europe, but that he did not have an exclusive preference for it and that this did not affect his writings, something that further analysis of his writings would show.<ref name=\"l294\" />\n\nThe East and South are not the only places that are associated with evil, especially in earlier history. In the First Age, evil came from the North when Morgoth based himself in [[Angband]]. Also, all Men and Elves first awoke in the East. [[Boromir]] is introduced as a \"man from the South\"<ref>{{FR|Council}}, p. 240</ref> without qualification (actually South-west).\n\n===Racial superiority===\nThe differences between races and racial hierarchy have led to the claims of racism in [[Arda]]. This claim can also be taken a step further to say for example, \"The Haradrim were based on Mongolians and were bad and morally inferior to Elves and other Men so therefore Tolkien viewed Mongolians as inferior.\"\n\nPart of the controversy may be caused in part by the conflicting uses of the word race. When we talk about race in humans we most often mean ethnic or cultural subgroups of humans. In Tolkien's writings, race is more similar to different species. Saying that Dwarves are better blacksmiths than Men is therefore more akin to claiming humans are better blacksmiths than bears, a generally uncontroversial statement. \n\nWhile no significant proof has been found proving that any (human) races are superior,<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aac4951|articlename=Taking race out of human genetics|dated=5 February 2016|website=|accessed=26 February 2024}}</ref> the different races of Middle-earth were created separately and in some cases by different beings. These differences are not due to failings of that particular group but to the goal their creator had in mind.\n\nAdditionally, while some beings in Middle-earth are objectively more powerful than others they are not necessarily portrayed as lesser because of it. Although in Middle-earth Hobbits were considered unimportant (by those who had even heard of them) and for most of history they were content to leave and be left alone by the world,<ref name=\"hobbits\">{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref> Hobbits had a massive influence on the events of the last Third Age, saving Middle-earth from the dominion of Sauron. In a book with [[wizards]], kings and soldiers, Tolkien stated that Sam, a gardener of the Shire, was the chief hero of the book.<ref>{{L|131}}</ref>\n\nAll the \"superior\" people, be they Elves, [[Edain]], or Dúnedain, have no direct analogues with peoples of the real world. If the Dúnedain could be put somewhere, they would belong in Atlantis, since Númenor was Middle-earth's counterpart to Plato's Atlantis.<ref>{{L|275}}</ref> The Rohirrim, who have been parallelled to blond and fair Europeans, are \"inferior\" to them, being Middle Men, in their view.\n\n===Race mixing===\nCritics have noticed possible themes of scientific racism and eugenics in Tolkien's writing primarily due to actual or feared racial decline due to race mixing.<ref name=\"young\" />\n\nOf the [[Orcs of Isengard]], [[Treebeard]] states: \n{{blockquote|It is a mark of evil things that came in the Great Darkness that they cannot abide the [[Sun]]; but Saruman's Orcs can endure it, even if they hate it. I wonder what he has done? Are they Men he has ruined, or has he blended the races of Orcs and Men? That would be a black evil!<ref>{{TT|Treebeard}}, p. 473</ref>}}\nThere were three marriages between an [[Eldar]] and Edain: [[Lúthien]] and [[Beren]], [[Idril]] and [[Tuor]], and [[Arwen]] and [[Aragorn]].<ref>{{App|Numenor}}</ref> Despite there being concerns from characters, primarily the fathers of the Elves, these unions are portrayed positively with the love story of Beren and Lúthien being inspired by his own wife, [[Edith Tolkien|Edith]].<ref>{{L|340}}</ref>\n\nThe blood of Númenor ran nearly true in the character of [[Faramir]],<ref>{{RK|MT}}</ref> a man whom Tolkien described as \"modest, fair-minded and scrupulously just, and very merciful\",<ref>{{L|244}}</ref> yet he chose to marry [[Éowyn]], who was a woman of Rohan and therefore undoubtedly of the race of [[Middle Men]].<ref>{{RK|Steward}}</ref><ref>{{TT|Window}}</ref>\n===Racism in Middle-earth===\nTolkien portrays racism within the \"heroic\" races as unabashedly negative. Elves and Dwarves distrust each other. Some Elves hunted the [[Petty-dwarves]] as animals,<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref> as did the Rohirrim to the [[Woses]].<ref>{{RK|Ride}}</ref> The friendship between [[Legolas]] and Gimli is portrayed as unusual but commendable,<ref>{{App|Later}}</ref> and several scenes illustrate them learning to understand and respect each other's cultural differences. When Gimli meets [[Galadriel]] and hears her speak the names of [[Mirrormere|Kheled-zâram]], [[Kibil-nâla]], and [[Khazad-dûm]] in his own tongue, he is described as feeling as if he had ''\"looked into the heart of an enemy and saw there love and understanding.\"''<ref>{{FR|Mirror}}, p. 356</ref> Later, when he originally asks for nothing of Lady Galadriel, although she had given every other member of the [[Fellowship]] a gift, she says, ''\"Let none say again that Dwarves are grasping and ungracious!\"''<ref>{{FR|Farewell}}, pp. 375-6</ref>\n\nIt is notable that there is apparently racism within the ranks of Orcs as the Uruk-hai held themselves as superior to the common Orcs, whom they called ''snaga'' (slave).<ref name=\"TT|Uruk\" />\n\nThe point-of-view characters of the book (the Hobbits) are themselves of a race that is frequently described as being overlooked, under-estimated, and lightly regarded by the other races of Middle-earth, yet they often demonstrate far greater courage and nobility than the races who denigrate them. They are not without prejudice, however, and [[Gandalf]] is shown reprimanding [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] for his comments on [[Barliman Butterbur]].<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}, pp. 220-1</ref>\n\nThe Númenóreans of Gondor fell to infighting because of a supposed need for racial purity, especially concerning the ancestry of their king (the [[Kin-strife]]), and grew weaker as a result. In this affair, the villain was the pure-blooded Númenórean [[Castamir]] while the hero was the half-Númenórean [[Eldacar (King of Gondor)|Eldacar]].\n\n==Counterindications== <!-- I've moved defences of individual claims to their respective sections above, this section should be used for general counterarguments against racism in the legendarium. This section needs expansion.-->\n\nTolkien's defenders assert that many criticisms of racism and elitism levelled at ''The Lord of the Rings'' and other writings are oversimplifications and generalizations, and do not take account of everything the author may have written concerning these matters.\n\nWhile some of his views may be seen as outdated today, Tolkien was fairly progressive for his time when it came to race. It seems unlikely that Tolkien who opposed the idea that some races were superior to others would choose to consciously use that as an element in his writings.\n\nTolkien was English and wanted to make a mythology for England. Therefore he wrote ''The Lord of the Rings'' according to his people's point of view. He could not make his protagonists, say, Incan or Japanese, or even put the setting anywhere else than (an alternative) North-western Europe, in spirit if not in actuality.\n\nMiddle-earth has been praised for its diversity and polyculturalism.<ref>{{webcite|author=Sandra Ballif Straubhaar|articleurl=https://ojs.ual.es/ojs/index.php/ODISEA/article/download/295/266/1083|articlename=Ethnic Diversity and Imperial Arrogance: Changing Attitudes toward Miscegenation and Multiculturalism in Tolkien’s Middle-earth|dated=2003|website=ODISEA: Revista de Estudios Ingleses|accessed=27 November 2025|archiveurl=|archivename=|archivedate=}}</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=Dimitra Fimi|articleurl=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057/9780230219519|articlename=Tolkien, Race and Cultural History: From Fairies to Hobbits|dated=2008|website=Palgrave Macmillan / SpringerLink|accessed=27 November 2025|archiveurl=|archivename=|archivedate=}}</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=James Farrell|articleurl=https://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/7806/1/Farrell_thesis2009.pdf|articlename=Race, Language, and Morality: Does Tolkien’s Middle-earth Promote a Racial Myth?|dated=2009|website=D-Scholarship Pitt|accessed=27 November 2025|archiveurl=|archivename=|archivedate=}}</ref>\n\n==Views==\n===Nazism and Judaism===\nTolkien's German publisher, Rütten & Loening, asked if he was of ''arisch'' (Aryan) origin.
