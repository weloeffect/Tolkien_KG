[[Frodo]] and [[Sam]] follow close behind. Sam shouts to Gollum, saying ''\"Hey Stinker, don't go getting too far ahead!\"'' Frodo asks him why he is always calling Gollum names and treating him unkindly. In response, Sam tells Frodo that Gollum is a liar and is only looking to get [[The One Ring|the Ring]]. Frodo considers and tells Sam that he wants to help Gollum; ''\"I have to believe he can come back\"'', Frodo says of Gollum. Sam does not believe that is possible, and Frodo snaps at him, telling him he knows nothing of the situation. After a moment, Frodo's anger dissipates, and he apologies to Sam. Somewhat taken aback by this, Sam tells him that Frodo's anger is due to the influence of the Ring and that he needs to fight it. In renewed anger, Frodo snaps back.\n{{blockquote|I know what I have to do Sam. The Ring was entrusted to me. It's my task. Mine! My own!|[[Frodo]] to [[Sam]]}}\nSam stands in shock as Frodo storms past him. He calls to Frodo, saying ''\"Don't you know who you sound like?\"''\n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers scenes|28]]"}}}
