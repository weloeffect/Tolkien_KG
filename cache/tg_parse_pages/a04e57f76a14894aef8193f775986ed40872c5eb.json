Tolkien - The Elvenking's Gate (II).jpg|thumb|''The Elvenking's Gate'' by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]\nThe '''Forest Gate''' was the western entrance to the [[Elf-path]] that led across [[Mirkwood]] to the [[Elvenking's Halls]]. It was formed as a sort of arch made by two great trees leaning together that were old, [[Ivies|ivy]]-strangled, hung with [[lichen]], and bearing but a few blackened leaves.  Beyond the gate the path became a gloomy tunnel, such that from within the forest the gate appeared as a small bright hole.<ref>{{H|Flies}}</ref>\n\nIt was a four-day ride by horse from [[Beorn]]'s house directly north to the Forest Gate, which was also to the northeast of the confluence of the [[Rhimdath]] and [[Anduin]] Rivers.  When [[Thorin]] and company came to the gate, they camped there overnight before entering the forest.  It was at this point that they released [[Beorn]]'s [[ponies]], and [[Gandalf]] left the party, to the consternation of the dwarves and [[Bilbo Baggins]].<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''\n:The Forest Gate has a small statue of Thranduil's wife, which is covered by the woods. There is also as a symbol of the [[Eye of Sauron]]. [[Gandalf]] leaves the company to investigate the tombs of the [[Nazgûl]].\n\n'''2018: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Forest Gate.jpg|thumb|200px|The Forest Gate in ''The Lord of the Rings Online'']]\n:The Forest Gate can be found in the northern [[Mirkwood]] region of \"[[Eryn Lasgalen]]\", allowing travel between the forest and the neighboring Beorning-lands.\n\n{{references}}\n{{companyroute}}\n[[Category:Doors and gates]]\n[[Category:Rhovanion]]\n[[de:Waldtor]]\n[[fi:Metsän Portti]]"}}}
