The Thain was master of the [[Shire-moot]] and captain of the [[Shire-muster]] and [[Hobbitry-in-arms]].<ref name=\"Order\">{{FR|Ordering}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nFor nearly four hundred years after its foundation, the Shire had been part of the lands of [[Arthedain]], and under the rule of that land's [[Kings of Arthedain|King]]. Ultimately, Arthedain fell to the forces of [[Angmar]], and its last King, [[Arvedui]], was lost in {{TA|1975}},<ref name=\"TA\">{{App|TA}}</ref> leaving the [[Shire-hobbits]] without a ruler. They remedied this by choosing a new leader from among themselves, [[Bucca of the Marish]], who was given the title ''thain'', a word simply meaning \"chief\" in [[Hobbitish|their dialect]].\n\nIn origin a military office, Thainship passed strictly through the male line.<ref name=Letter>{{L|214}}</ref> \n\nBucca and his descendants, a family known as the [[Oldbucks]], served as Shire-thain for twelve generations. The twelfth Thain, one [[Gorhendad Oldbuck]], left the Shire and crossed the River [[Brandywine]] to found [[Buckland]].<ref name=\"Conspiracy\">{{FR|I5}}</ref> With his departure, the Thainship passed to a new line, the preeminent [[Took Family|Tooks]], and specifically to [[Isumbras Took I]].<ref name=\"Order\"/>\n\nAs a rule, the Thain was also the head of the Took clan (known as \"The Took\") and the [[Great Smials]], but the two offices were not identical, as if the Thain was survived by a widow, she remained the head of the Tooks; at least this was the case of [[Lalia Clayhanger]], widow of Thain [[Fortinbras Took II|Fortinbras II]].<ref name=Letter/>\n\nBut as the times of emergency in the Shire were rare, as the need for the muster and the moot (the [[Battle of Greenfields|only battle]] was fought in {{TA|2747}} and the [[Fell Winter (Third Age)|last emergency]] in {{TA|2912}}), the title ended up as nothing more than nominal. Indeed, there was no \"government\" in the Shire as the clans managed their own affairs. By the end of the Age, the [[Mayor of Michel Delving]] was \"the only real official in the Shire\".<ref name=\"Order\"/>\n\nFrom Isumbras I, the line of the Took Shire-thains continued unbroken to the time of the [[War of the Ring]] and beyond with Peregrin I when thainship became also a Counsellor office of the [[Reunited Kingdom|North Kingdom]].<ref name=\"Later\">{{App|Later}}</ref>\n\nThe last recorded Thain was his son, [[Faramir Took I]], the thirty-fourth to hold the title of Shire-thain.<ref name=\"Later\"/> The fact that both he and his father [[Peregrin Took]] are recorded as the first of that name shows that there must have been more Thains after this time, and the office clearly lasted well into the [[Fourth Age]].\n\nPeregrin's successors continued the custom of gathering many [[Gondor]]ian manuscripts mainly copies or summaries of legends relating to [[Elendil]] and his heirs, and the libraries of [[Great Smials]] were the only place in the Shire with sources of [[Númenor]]ean interest. Pippin's great-grandson (not known if he was a Thain himself) requested a copy of the [[Thain's Book]], completed for him by [[Findegil]].<ref>{{FR|Records}}</ref>\n\n==List of Thains==\nIt is known that there were at least thirty-three Shire-thains, from [[Bucca of the Marish]], who became Thain in {{TA|1979}}, to [[Faramir Took I|Faramir I]], who took on the title in {{FoA|63}}, more than a thousand years later.\n{|class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|- style=\"background: var(--tg-color-surface-2);\" \n!
