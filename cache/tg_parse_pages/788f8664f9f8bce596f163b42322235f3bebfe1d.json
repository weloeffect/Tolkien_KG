Water Hot is a noble thing! \n\nO! Sweet is the sound of falling rain, \nand the brook that leaps from hill to plain; \nbut better than rain or rippling streams \nis Water Hot that smokes and steams. \n\nO! Water cold we may pour at need \ndown a thirsty throat and be glad indeed; \nbut better is Beer if drink we lack, \nand Water Hot poured down the back. \n\nO! Water is fair that leaps on high \nin a fountain white beneath the sky; \nbut never did fountain sound so sweet \nas splashing Hot Water with my feet!\n</poem>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2001: {{fotree}}:'''\n:In the scene \"[[At the Green Dragon]]\", [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], and [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] sing a song closely resembling ''[[Ho!
