They were an unruly folk, as prone to troubling [[Men]] as they were to in-fighting, yet stronger than their northern brethren that had escaped Morgoth's disastrous defeat. Though initially apprehensive of him, the Eastern Orcs eventually came under the sovereignty of [[Sauron]].<ref name=Cuv/>\n\n== History ==\nScions of the Orcs that had presumably evaded the [[Valar]] when they took Melkor prisoner in the aftermath of the [[Battle of the Powers]], the Eastern Orcs were among the sturdiest of that foul race, certainly more fearsome than those that remained hidden in the North. Becoming accustomed to this autonomous way of living throughout the time of Melkor's captivity and far away from his dominion, they became an unmanageable rabble by the time he returned and settled in [[Thangorodrim]]. They were as likely to hunt Men, regardless of their allegiance, as they were to turn on one another owing to the lack of a singular will to organize them.<ref name=Cuv/>\n\nDue to their remote location they survived Morgoth's defeat in the [[War of Wrath]], thus being more numerous than other remnants of evil forces. Even by the time of Sauron's early rise, the Eastern Orcs were still a disorderly faction and did not immediately bend the knee to him, ensuring his grip on the southern and eastern lands was not as firm he would have hoped. While Sauron assumed a fair hue to deceive the [[Elves]], they held him in disdain and laughed at him.<ref name=Cuv/> Nonetheless, the [[Dark Lord]] ultimately succeeded in uniting all of the Orcs including these petty tribes in the East in a centralized vassalage through their common hatred of both Men and [[Elves]].<ref>{{MR|P5VIII}}, pp. 419-420</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2024: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:In the lands of [[Near Harad]], the game introduces the \"Utûgi\" - larger, stronger, and more intelligent orcs bred by Morgoth himself. They are taller than even the [[Uruk-hai]] and possess strength that [[Sauron]] could never match in orcs bred in later ages. Though Sauron knew of the Utûgi, they were never among his servants, as those that did not drown in [[Beleriand]] were put in deep slumber and did not awaken until the land itself was reshaped by great quakes that followed Sauron's own downfall.\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Orcs]]\n[[Category:Servants of Sauron]]"}}}
