Halbrand was invented by [[Amazon Studios]] for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]. He'' is portrayed by [[Charlie Vickers]].<ref>{{webcite|author=The Lord of the Rings on Prime|articleurl=https://twitter.com/LOTRonPrime/status/1492169017741778944|articlename=Charlie Vickers is Halbrand. #LOTRROP|dated=11 February 2022|website=[https://twitter.com Twitter]|accessed=15 February 2023}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Beginnings ===\nFollowing the defeat of [[Morgoth]], Sauron rallies a gathering of [[Orcs]] to swear allegiance to him. An Uruk leader named [[Adar]] feigns that he is going to place the crown of Morgoth upon Sauron's head and swear fealty to him, but he stabs him with it instead. A struggle ensues in which Sauron fails to fight off a number of Orcs before he is overwhelmed and stabbed repeatedly. His bodily form is slain and his spirit flees.\n\nSauron slowly reconstitutes himself in a cave, forming a rudimentary and amorphous physical form. He uses this form to crawl out of the cave and eventually finds his way onto a horse drawn cart and appears to absorb the cart driver into his body. After this absorption, he is able to create a male human form that would come to be known as Halbrand.\n\n=== Shipwreck ===\n[[File:The Rings of Power (TV series) - Halbrand poster.jpg|thumb|200px|The ''Halbrand poster'' for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'']]\n\nAfter encountering a group of [[Pre-Númenóreans|Southlanders]] led by [[Diarmid]] fleeing some unknown force, Halbrand joins them aboard a ship sailing through the [[Sundering Seas]]. That night, a nameless thing known only as the [[Nameless things|worm]] attacked the ship, forcing him onto a raft alongside [[Abigail]], [[Astrid (The Rings of Power)|Astrid]], [[Doble]], [[Eamon (The Rings of Power)|Eamon]], and two others. Eventually, after drifting for some time, they came upon the Elf [[Galadriel]], but the encounter was short-lived, as the worm returned to finish them off. Halbrand broke a section of the raft, abandoning the others before pulling Galadriel onto it and asking her where she wanted him to take her.\n\nSoon afterwards, a storm came upon them and lightning struck the raft, causing Galadriel to fall into the water, being dragged down by a weighted pole. However, with some slight hesitation, Halbrand rescued her before they both lose consciousness.\n\n=== Númenor ===\nEventually, their raft is discovered by [[Elendil|Captain Elendil]], who brings them to the [[Armenelos|capital]] of [[Númenor]], where they are presented to the [[Tar-Míriel|Queen Regent Míriel]]. When Galadriel aggressively makes demands of Míriel, Halbrand intervenes before things could escalate further, warning Galadriel to not make any enemies there.\n\nWith Galadriel restricted to the palace grounds, Halbrand explored the city and met a [[Guild of Weaponsmiths|smithy]] who told him that he must get a guild crest in order to work for him. Halbrand later encountered a group of guildsmen while eating and gets them drunk. In the process, he stole a guild crest belonging to a man named [[Tamar (The Rings of Power)|Tamar]]. Upon turning a corner assured of his victory, Halbrand is soon made aware that the guildsmen followed him. Despite trying to give back the crest, the guildsmen begin taking blows at him, provoking Halbrand into violently retaliating, severely wounding them. Upon being caught, he allowed himself to be arrested.\n\nGaladriel soon visited him, giving him a scroll from the [[Hall of Lore]] identifying the insignia he wore as the emblem of the Kings of the Southlands. Halbrand revealed to her that he picked up the insignia on a dead man believing that it suited him. Galadriel refused to listen to him.\n\nEventually, Halbrand gets released and sets out to begin a new start at life working as a blacksmith's apprentice, presumably attaining a guild crest to be able to do so. He is later is forced by Galadriel to join the Númenórean expedition to Middle-earth to retake the Southlands from Orcs.\n\n=== Southlands ===\nUpon arriving at Middle-earth, Halbrand rode with the cavalry across the [[Ephel Dúath]] to the village of [[Tirharad]]. Though they deal easily with the Orcs, their leader, Adar, flees with Galadriel pursuing him. While riding, Halbrand seized a spear from a corpse, and maneuvering through the forest, he ended up riding towards where Adar was heading. Using the spear to trip the horse, Halbrand dismounted Adar, who attempted to provoke him into killing him, though Galadriel prevented Halbrand from doing so. Later, Halbrand returned the favor by preventing Galadriel from doing the same during her interrogation of Adar.\n\nAfterwards, Míriel introduced Halbrand to [[Bronwyn]] and the villagers of Tirharad as the promised King of the Southlands. Shortly after, Tirharad is destroyed when [[Mount Doom|Orodruin]] violently erupted. In the ensuing chaos, Halbrand received a serious wound to his abdomen, and was brought to the Númenórean camp outside of the affected region. Upon Galadriel's arrival, it was revealed that his wound required Elvish healing. While Halbrand declared that he still intended to retake the Southlands, he rode alongside Galadriel to [[Eregion]].\n\n=== Sauron Revealed ===\nAt the [[Ost-in-Edhil|City of the Elven-smiths]], Halbrand recovered quickly and meets [[Celebrimbor|Lord Celebrimbor]] in his workshop, learning of [[Mithril]] and the struggles of the [[Elves]]. Halbrand managed to get Celebrimbor to overcome his despair, and to work on saving his race.\n\nHowever, Galadriel confronted him about a genealogical scroll that revealed that the last King of the Southlands had died thousands of years ago with no heirs. Halbrand was thus forced to reveal his identity as Sauron, ruining his chance at receiving aid from others in redeeming himself of his past evil deeds. Halbrand effortlessly blocked Galadriel's subsequent attack, entering her mind to try to prove to her that he desired to redeem himself to heal Middle-earth and everything he did as a servant of [[Morgoth]].\n\nNevertheless, Galadriel refused to believe that he was redeemable and Halbrand fled Eregion, returning to the Southlands, newly-renamed to [[Mordor]].\n\n=== Brief reappearance ===\nDuring the [[Sack of Eregion]], Sauron briefly duels Galadriel on a mountaintop overlooking the city. During this battle, he assumes different forms to goad Galadriel. One of these forms is a clean-shaven Halbrand.[[File:The Rings of Power (TV series) - Halbrand in Mordor.jpg|thumb|200px|''Halbrand in Mordor'' from ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'']]\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe show's writers have never revealed the etymology behind the name ''Halbrand''. It has been speculated that it could possibly be a [[Sindarin]] name comprised of the element ''[[Brand (word)|brand]]'' (\"towering; tall and massive\") and the [[Noldorin]] ''[[hall]]'' (\"exalted, high\").<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://www.theonering.com/tolkien-encyclopedia/halbrand/|articlename=Halbrand|dated=|website=[https://www.theonering.com/TheOneRing.com]|accessed=23 April 2024}}</ref> But it seems more likely that the name is derived from [[Old English]] ''[[Wiktionary:brand#Old English|brand]]'' (\"fire-brand, torch; sword\"),<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 413 (discussion on name ''[[Erkenbrand]]'')</ref> since the Southlanders do not generally seem to have used [[Elvish]] names.\n\n== Genealogy ==\nThere is a genealogical scroll that appears face up within the final episode, ''[[Alloyed]]'', at the following time stamps: 39:15, 40:26, 40:27, and 40:28. If a translation of it has been made, then please replace this note with it.\n\n== Inspiration ==\nIn Scene 22, the words that Halbrand, having already revealed himself as [[Sauron]], says to [[Galadriel]] are almost the same words that Galadriel says to [[Frodo Baggings|Frodo]] in the chapter '[[The Mirror of Galadriel]]', the seventh chapter of the [[The Fellowship of the Ring|first book]] of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' novel.\n\nHalbrand's apppearance as Sauron in the sea in Galadriel's mind seems to be inspired by Sauron's dark form as seen in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings film series]] and [[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit film series]] by [[Peter Jackson]].\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Men from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) characters]]\n\n[[fi:Halbrand (televisiosarjan hahmo)]]"}}}
