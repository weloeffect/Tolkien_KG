Tolkien]].\n\n\"Mythopoeia\" was written as reaction to [[C.S. Lewis]]' statement that myths were \"lies breathed through silver.\" The poem takes a position opposed to rationalism and materialism, referring to the creative human author as \"the little maker\" wielding his \"own small golden sceptre\" ruling his [[Sub-creation]] (understood as genuine Creation within God's primary Creation).\n\nWhile quoted in \"[[On Fairy-Stories]]\" (1947), and mentioned by [[Humphrey Carpenter]] in his ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]'' (1977), the poem was first published in its entirety in the [[1988]] edition of '''''[[Tree and Leaf]]'''''.<ref>{{CG|RG}}, pp. 620-2</ref>\n\n==Excerpt==\n''<poem>I will not treat your dusty path and flat, \ndenoting this and that by this and that, \nyour world immutable wherein no part \nthe little maker has with maker's art. \nI bow not yet before the Iron Crown, \nnor cast my own small golden sceptre down.</poem>''\n\n==Etymology==\nFrom the Greek ''μυθοποιία'' (myth-making); its first known appearance in English was as ''mythopœic'' in 1864, in the first volume of ''A History of Greece'' by George Grote.<ref>George Grote, [https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/56342/pg56342.txt ''A History of Greece'']</ref>\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181406/http://mercury.ccil.org/~cowan/mythopoeia.html Mythopoeia]\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Poems by J.R.R.
