It's unspecified on why Thorin had a meeting with all houses of the Dwarves, however it's likely for the purpose of declaring war on [[Smaug]] and to reclaim his homeland. \n\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Stiffbeards.jpg|thumb|The \"Kámbrada\" in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2017: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n: The House corresponding to the Stiffbeards is called the '''Kámbrada''', also known as '''Drása's Folk'''. Their \"outer\" names are mostly based on old Baltic, with some old Slavonic and Norse. Their bannes show a white beard under a hammer and chisel. They refused [[Sauron]]'s demand to return their [[Seven Rings|Dwarf-ring]], \"Sindya\", also known as \"Manthríf\", and so Sauron reclaimed the Ring by force and enslaved many of Drása's Folk. At some point in history, the Kámbrada warred with the [[Ironfists#Portrayal in adaptations|Zhélruka]], but during the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]] their King \"Usk\" befriended his Zhélruka counterpart \"King Vélat\". Usk fell in the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] and was succeeded by his son \"Ugún\".\n\n: Those of the Kámbrada enslaved in [[Mordor]] lost much of their culture and history and came to be known as \"Stout-axes\", or \"Khirvísa\" in their language. After Sauron's defeat, the Stout-axes were discovered by [[Gimli]] and at his behest many came to [[Erebor]] as refugees. Stout-axes were introduced as a playable race with the release of ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Minas Morgul]]'' expansion pack. In the introduction for Stout-axe player characters, the player escapes Mordor when [[Gollum]] is set free from [[Barad-dûr]], and then takes refuge among the Longbeards of [[Thorin's Halls|Thorin's Hall]].\n\n{{references}}\n{{dwarvenclans}}"}}}
