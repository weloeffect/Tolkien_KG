The band takes inspiration from fantasy authors as well as traditional legends and epics. The 1998 album ''[[Nightfall in Middle-Earth]]'', most notably, is a concept album based on Tolkien's ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.\n\nBeyond projects that came to fruition, the band was at some point under negotiations for soundtrack work for [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]]. They had also planned to release ''The Lord of the Rings'' orchestral music around [[2008]].<ref name=\"high\">{{Webcite|articleurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402213457/http://www.highwiredaze.com/blind.htm|articlename=A New Twist in the Blind Guardian Legacy (Interview)|website=[https://web.archive.org/web/20120321083852/http://highwiredaze.com/ Highwire Daze]|accessed=27 June 2025}} (archived)</ref>\n\n==Discography, selected==\n*'''Studio Albums'''\n**''Battalions of Fear'' (1988)\n**''Tales from the Twilight World'' (1990)\n**''Imaginations From the Other Side'' (1995)\n***[[Imaginations from the other Side|''Imaginations from the Other Side (song)'']]\n**''[[Nightfall in Middle-Earth]]'' (1998)\n*'''Singles'''\n**''[[Mirror Mirror]]'' (1998)\n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Songs by Blind Guardian|Songs by Blind Guardian]]\n{{references}}\n==External links==\n*{{WP|Blind Guardian}}\n*[http://blind-guardian.com Official Site]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/blindguardian Official Facebook Page]\n[[Category:Bands]]\n[[Category:Heavy metal]]\n\n[[de:Blind Guardian]]"}}}
