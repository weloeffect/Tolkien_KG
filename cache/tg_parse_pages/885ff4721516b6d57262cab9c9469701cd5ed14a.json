The Five Towns were once the most important of the North, but now all but Dolindîr are desterted. They were:<ref name=\"Arthedain\">{{LOTROW|Quest:Ruins of Arthedain|19 June 2023}}</ref>\n*Dolindîr, now Esteldín\n*Henneth Rhún, established in {{TA|1409}}\n*Duintham, established in {{TA|1249}}\n*Carnoglin, established between {{TA|1272}} and {{TA|1349}}<ref>\"During the reign of Malvegil\"->{{App|North}}</ref>\n*Ost Ardúlin, now swarmed with orcs<ref>{{LOTROW|Merenost|19 June 2023}}</ref>\n\nThe Refuge of Esteldín itself was established long after the Five Towns had become ruins, by the [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]] named Arasuil, son of Arahad.<ref name=\"Arthedain\" /> At the time of the [[War of the Ring]], [[Halbarad]] was in command of the city. He sends the players out to help the inhabitants of the North Downs and eventually helps in the Battle of the Trestlebridge.<ref>{{LOTROW|Halbarad|19 June 2023}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nEsteldín is located in the mountains of Kingsfell in the North Downs. It is made in a vale in the mountains, and it lies hidden, not even being mentioned on the map. The main enterance lies in the west, where you come to the Forecourt after walking down the hidden street. Behind the Forecourt is the Central Courtyard, where Halbarand's library is, and behind that lies the Craftmen's Courtyard, where all the crafting facilities are. From here you can exit the city by the east entrance, leading you to Nan Amlug.<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=https://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/Esteld%C3%ADn#Civic_Structures_and_Facilities|articlename=Esteldín, Civic Structures and Facilities|website=LOTROW|accessed=19 June 2023}}</ref>\n\nThe inhabitants are the [[Rangers of the North|Rangers of Esteldín]], also a reputation faction in the game. They are the remnants of the people of [[Arthedain]] and [[Arnor]]. They are the only power, beside the Elves of [[Rivendell]] that might still offer resistance against the rise of [[Angmar]].<ref>{{LOTROW|Rangers of Esteldín|20 June 2023}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Esteldín'' is said to mean \"Hidden Hope\" in Sindarin on the LOTRO-Wiki,<ref>{{LOTROW|Esteldín|19 June 2023}}</ref> with ''estel'' meaning \"hope\" and ''dín'' maybe coming from ''[[din]]'', meaning \"silent\".\n\n''Dolindîr'' is Sindarin made out of ''dolin'', meaning \"hidden\"<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entry ''[[gond]]''</ref> and ''dîr'', meaning \"man\". ''dîr'' is an agental ending not typically used for place names but may translate as \"Hidden City of Men\".\n\n{{references}}\n==External links==\n* {{LOTROW|Esteldín|link=yes}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings Online locations]]"}}}
