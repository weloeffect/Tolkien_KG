The hills, most notable in the eastern areas, were surrounding the Hill of [[Himring]], the capital fortress.<ref name=\"Map\"/>\n\n==History==\nIt was fortified by Maedhros after he moved his brothers and their people further east out of [[Hithlum]] to avoid any feuds with their kinsmen. He established himself on Himring. It was frequently attacked by the forces of Angband throughout the [[First Age]] in the Battles of Beleriand, generally because it lacked in natural fortification, until it was finally overrun during the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]].<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://middle-earth.xenite.org/2013/10/23/did-the-march-of-maedhros-include-the-lands-of-his-brothers/ Did the March of Maedhros Include the Lands of his Brothers?] by [[Michael Martinez]]\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Regions]]\n[[Category:Beleriand]]\n\n[[fi:Maedhrosin Rajamaa]]\n[[de:Maedhros’ Mark]]"}}}
