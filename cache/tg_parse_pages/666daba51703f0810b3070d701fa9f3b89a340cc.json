'Incompletion' and unceasing change, often frustrating to those who study these languages, was inherent in this art.|[[Christopher Tolkien]] on his father's invented languages in his commentary to ''[[Lowdham's Report on the Adunaic Language|Lowdham's Report]]''}}\n\nAccording to [[Pengolodh]], the sage of [[Gondolin]], the making of a '''language''' is the chief character of an [[Incarnate]]. The speaking peoples used languages to communicate. The first of those races were the [[Dwarves]] who were taught by [[Aulë]] and then the [[Elves]], who called themselves [[Quendi|Kwendî]], the \"Speakers\".\n\nIn the history of [[Arda]], the [[Elvish]] tongues were separated as part of the peoples emigrating while others stay behind, leading to a split of [[Quenya]] (High-Elvish, or Elf-Latin) and [[Sindarin]].\n\n==Linguistic lore==\nIn Quenya, ''[[lambë]]'' is the term for spoken language or verbal communiation while ''tengwesta'' is a more abstract term for a system or a code of signs and may be translated as \"grammar\". As [[Pengolodh]] noted, \"The making of a lambe  is the chief character of an Incarnate,\" including the [[Valar]].<ref>{{WJ|AD1}}, p.397</ref>\n\nIn [[Valinor]], the Elves began to be interested in the nature of their languages. These loremasters were called [[lambengolmor]]. Usually they would compare [[Quenya]] proper against [[Telerin]] and point out the original [[Primitive Quendian]].\n\nThe invention of writing is attributed to [[Rúmil (elf of Tirion)|Rúmil]], who first invented an alphabet: the [[Sarati]] (literally \"letters\"). [[Fëanor]] later enhanced and further developed this alphabet into the [[Tengwar]], which were spread to Middle-earth by the [[Noldor|Ñoldor]] and remained in use ever after.\n\n[[Daeron]] of [[Doriath]] indepently of Rúmil and Fëanor had invented the [[Cirth]] [[Runes]], but these were only used for inscriptions, and otherwise replaced by the Tengwar, except among the [[Dwarves]].\n\nAn important source of Middle-earth linguistic scholarship is [[Pengolodh]] of Gondolin who wrote in Quenya. He is the author of ''[[Quendi and Eldar]]'', the ''[[Lhammas]]'' and ''[[Ósanwe-kenta]]''.\n\n==List of languages==\n[[File:Patrick H. Wynne - Gandalf.jpg|thumb|''Gandalf'' by [[Patrick H.

For older linguistic concepts see [[The Tree of Tongues]], [[Oromean]], [[Aulean]], [[Goldogrin]], [[Kornoldorin]], [[Noldorin]], [[Qenya]], [[Ilkorin]], [[Doriathrin]], [[Nandorin]] and [[Taliska]].\n\n==Inspiration==\n{{quote|What I think is a primary 'fact' about my work, that it is all of a piece, and fundamentally linguistic in inspiration. [...] The invention of languages is the foundation. The 'stories' were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse. To me a name comes first and the story follows [...] It is to me, anyway,  largely an essay in 'linguistic aesthetic', as I sometimes say to people who ask me 'what is it all about'.|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]<ref>{{L|165}}</ref>}}\nLanguage-making was Tolkien's hobby for most of his life. He is known to have constructed his first languages ([[Animalic]] and [[Nevbosh]]) at a little over thirteen and he continued to ponder upon his creations up until his death more than sixty-five years later. Language invention had always been tightly connected to the mythology that Tolkien developed, as he found that a language could not be complete without the history of the people who spoke it, just as these people could never be fully realistic if imagined only through the English and as speaking English. Tolkien therefore took the stance of a translator and adaptor rather than that of the original author of his works.\n\nTolkien was a professional philologist and a specialist in the Old English language. He was also interested in many languages outside his field and developed a particular love for the Finnish language (he described the finding of a Finnish grammar book as \"entering a complete wine-cellar filled with bottles of an amazing wine of a kind and flavour never tasted before\".<ref>{{L|214}}</ref>\n\nFinnish morphology (particularly its rich system of inflection) in part gave rise to [[Quenya]]. Another of Tolkien's favorites was [[Welsh]] &mdash; and features of Welsh phonology found their way to [[Sindarin]]. Numerous words were borrowed from existing languages, but less and less obviously as Tolkien progressed. Words that are an exact match with existing Welsh words can be found in the early drafts of Tolkien’s manuscripts published as ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'',<ref>[[Mark T. Hooker]], ''[[Tolkien and Welsh]]'', p. viii</ref> but attempts to match a source to a particular Elvish word or name in works published during his lifetime are often very dubious.\n\nIn discussing the languages [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] invented, it is necessary to consider two aspects: their \"primary world\" history, namely their literal development by Tolkien as a linguist, and their \"[[secondary world]]\" history, namely their imagined historical development in the history of Middle-earth.\n\nAlthough the [[Elvish]] languages [[Sindarin]] and [[Quenya]] are the most famous and the most mature languages of those that Tolkien invented for his mythology, they are by no means the only ones. They belong to a family of Elvish dialects, that originate in [[Common Eldarin]], the language common to all [[Eldar]], which in turn originates in [[Primitive Quendian]], the common root of [[Eldar]]in and [[Avari]]n languages. In addition to that, there is a separate language family that is spoken by Men, the most prominent member of which was [[Westron]] (derived from the [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] speech [[Adûnaic]]) or the \"Common speech\" of the peoples of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Most Mannish tongues showed influences by Elvish, as well as some [[Dwarvish]] influences. Several independent languages were drafted as well, for example the [[Khuzdul]] language of the Dwarves. Other languages are [[Valarin]] (the tongue of the [[Valar]]), and the [[Black Speech]] created by [[Sauron]] during the Second Age.\n\n==Elvish scholarship==\n{{quote|Indeed it would be the only fitting monument to a man who had to invent a whole world just to have a place where people could greet one another with the words ''[[Elen síla lúmenn' omentielvo]]''.|[[Helge Fauskanger]], [http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/vice.htm Tolkien's Not-So-Secret Vice]}} \nAlthough the study of Tolkien's languages is as a rule not taken seriously by mainstream linguistics, a number of serious scholars have worked on compiling all that can be recovered about their histories and grammars.\n \nAn early book dedicated to Tolkien's languages is ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'' by [[Jim Allan]] (published by Bran's Head Books), written before the publication of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' in 1977 and therefore mostly outdated.\n\nThere are several journals dedicated to the subject:\n*''[[Quettar]]'', was the Bulletin of the Linguistic Fellowship of [[The Tolkien Society]], the oldest Eldarin publication.\n*''[[Vinyar Tengwar]]'' and ''[[Parma Eldalamberon]]'' are published by the [[Elvish Linguistic Fellowship]]. \n*''[[Tyalië Tyelelliéva]]'' was published by [[Lisa Star]]. \n*''[[Mythlore]]'' is published by the [[Mythopoeic Society]]. \n*''[[Beyond Bree]]'' is published by [[Nancy Martsch]]. \n*''[[Tengwestië (journal)|Tengwestië]]'' published via online by the Elvish Linguistic Fellowship.\n\nWith the rise of the Internet, mailing lists dedicated to Tolkien linguistics spread, being the most famous [[Tolklang]], [[Elfling]] and [[Lambengolmor (mailing list)|Lambengolmor]]. Many scholars and editors were involved there, but they are currently dissolved. Spiritual heirs are the Discord server [http://discord.gg/Dhmyzrf Vinyë Lambengolmor] and websites like [http://www.elfdict.com/ Parf Edhellen] and [http://eldamo.org/index.html Eldamo].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Portal:Languages]]\n\n==External links and references==\n*[http://www.uib.no/People/hnohf/ Ardalambion] A site containing much knowledge about Tolkien's languages and questions surrounding them.\n*[http://www.elvish.org/ The Elvish Linguistic Fellowship]\n*[http://www.dcs.ed.ac.uk/misc/local/TolkLang/ the Tolkien language mailing list]\n*[http://www.jerekdain.com/tolkien.html Tolkien information: Languages, Elves, the Ainur, and the Valar]\n*[http://www.elvish.org/gwaith/language.htm Fellowship of the Word-smiths] With language courses, links, translations, and much more\n\n{{References}}\n{{languages}}\n[[Category:Languages]]\n[[de:Sprachen]]\n[[fr:langues/langues]]"}}}
