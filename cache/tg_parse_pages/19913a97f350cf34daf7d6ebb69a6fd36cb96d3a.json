Doble was invented for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'' by [[Amazon Studios]], where he was mentioned.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10582302/fullcredits|articlename=Full Cast & Crew|dated=|website=IMDB|accessed=2 September 2022}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nDoble was from the southlands of [[Middle-earth]], though his home was attacked by [[Orcs]], and he had to flee with a group of companions. Along with [[Halbrand]], [[Eamon (The Rings of Power)|Eamon]], [[Astrid (The Rings of Power)|Astrid]], [[Abigail]], and two other castaways, Doble was eventually stranded in the midst of the [[Sundering Seas]] after their ship was destroyed by a nameless thing known only as [[Nameless things|the worm]].\n\nAfter two weeks at sea, Doble died of unknown circumstances. Eamon later claimed that Abigail was partly to blame for his death.\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Men from adaptations]]"}}}
