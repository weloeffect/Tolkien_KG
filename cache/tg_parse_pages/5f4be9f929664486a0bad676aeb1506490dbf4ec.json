Lewis]], published during the 1950s. The seven books in the series are ''[http://narnia.wikia.com/wiki/The_Lion,_the_Witch_and_the_Wardrobe The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]'' ([[1950]]), ''[http://narnia.wikia.com/wiki/Prince_Caspian Prince Caspian]'' ([[1951]]), ''[http://narnia.wikia.com/wiki/The_Voyage_of_the_Dawn_Treader The Voyage of the Dawn Treader]'' ([[1952]]), ''[http://narnia.wikia.com/wiki/The_Silver_Chair The Silver Chair]'' ([[1953]]), ''[http://narnia.wikia.com/wiki/The_Horse_and_His_Boy The Horse and His Boy]'' ([[1954]]), ''[http://narnia.wikia.com/wiki/The_Magician's_Nephew The Magician's Nephew]'' ([[1955]]), and ''[http://narnia.wikia.com/wiki/The_Last_Battle The Last Battle]'' ([[1956]]).\n\n[[J.R.R.

Tolkien]], \"[[Letter to Eileen Elgar (24 December 1971)]]\" (letter)</ref> giving the reason that it depended on \"''merely a difference in taste''\".<ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 758</ref> [[George Sayer]] has remarked that Tolkien's dislike of the novels derived from \"''assembling figures from various mythologies''\" and that the books \"''were carelessly and superficially written''.\"<ref>[[George Sayer]], ''Jack: A Life of C.S. Lewis'' (2nd ed., 1994), p. 313)</ref> On the other hand, his granddaughter [[Joan Anne Tolkien]] remembers that her grandfather directed her to reading his copies of ''The Chronicles of Narnia'' before ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', suggesting that it was \"''perhaps an indication of his humility''\".<ref>[[Joan Anne Tolkien]], \"Joanna Tolkien Speaks at the Tolkien Society Annual Dinner, Shrewsbury, April 16, 1994\", in ''[[Digging Potatoes, Growing Trees]]'' (ed. [[Helen Armstrong]]), p. 34</ref><ref>{{CG|RG}}, p. 507</ref>\n\n[[Pauline Baynes]], an artist Tolkien appreciated and frequently used,<ref>{{L|235}}</ref> made the original cover and interior illustrations for the books in the ''The Chronicles of Narnia'' series.\n\n[[Daniel Reeve]], an artist who worked in the production of [[Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings|Peter Jackson's ''The Lord of the Rings'']], also worked for the ''Narnia'' movies.\n\n''The Magician's Nephew'' shows Aslan creating Narnia while singing, like [[Arda]] and [[Eä]].
