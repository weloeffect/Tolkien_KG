The [[Garth of the Graves]] was possibly built around it.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nHaleth was the daughter of [[Haldad]] of the [[Haladin]], who led her people westward across [[Beleriand]] and founded the settlement of [[Men]] in the [[Forest of Brethil]]. After her death, the [[People of Haleth]] - as they had become known - raised a [[Barrows|barrow]] (known as Tûr Haretha or Haudh-en-Arwen) for her in the Forest.<ref name=\"West\">{{S|West}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[Sindarin]] term ''Haudh-en-Arwen''<ref name=\"West\"/> can roughly be translated as \"'''Ladybarrow'''\". The actual translation would be \"Mound of the Noble Maiden\". The element ''Arwen'' had no direct connection with [[Arwen|Arwen Evenstar]], who lived millennia after Haleth's time, but it does give an insight into the origin of her name. [[Sindarin]] ''arwen'' means literally \"high maiden\", and is translated here as the \"lady\" in 'Ladybarrow'.\n\n'''Tûr Haretha''' is the Mannish name of \"The Ladybarrow\".\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[Category:Graves and tombs]]\n\n[[de:Haudh-en-Arwen]]\n[[fi:Haudh-en-Arwen]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/tombes/haudh-en-arwen]]"}}}
