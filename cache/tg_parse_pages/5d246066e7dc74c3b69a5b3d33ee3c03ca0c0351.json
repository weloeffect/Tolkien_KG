The Elves living there were immediately drawn to him, as he had taught them, and instructed them in deep knowledge - eventually, he became a mighty king among them.\n\nThe Ilkorin tales later called him the ''[[Lord of Gloaming]]'', and all the Ilkorindi under his rule were called '''''Hisildi''''' or the ''twilight people''.<ref name=\"Nuin\"/>\n\n=== Nuin and the Awakening of Men ===\nOne particularly famous Hisildë was a wise Elf named [[Nuin]]. He was the one who stumbled upon the first [[Men]] in [[Murmenalda]] while they were still asleep, awaiting their [[Awakening of Men|Awakening]].<ref name=\"Nuin\"/>\n\nHe played an important role in the development of humanity, since he was the one who thought them speech - hence his nickname the ''Father of Speech''. He was the one who awoke [[Ermon]] and [[Elmir]], the first Men to awaken, after which the rest of Men learned to speak; and they spread all over Palisor, gaining the knowledge of the Hisildi, and from there went in all directions of the world - and a great age passed.<ref name=\"Gil\">{{LT1|X}}, p. 237</ref>\n\n=== The War of Palisor ===\nHowever, a servant of [[Melko]] called [[Fankil]], along with [[Goblins]] and [[Dwarves]],<ref group=\"note\">At this early phase of the legendarium, Dwarves were overwhelmingly portrayed in a negative light.</ref> alienated most of the Men against the Elves. And in the first war between Goblins and Elves, called the [[War of Palisor]], of Men only the folk of Ermon sided with the Elves. The famed Nuin also fought there, but in the end he died at the hands of Goblins \"through the treachery of Men\".<ref name=\"Gil\"/>\n\n=== Aftermath ===\nFortunately, one Ilkorin called [[Tareg]] evidently managed to escape, and hearing a rumour of the returned [[Noldoli]] fighting Melko in the North-west, he immediately decided to march there.\n\nFinally, of Tû, the fay-king of the Hisildi, it is said that after the proliferation of Men and their growth in stature, he \"faded before the [[Sun]] and hid in the bottomless caverns\".<ref name=\"Gil\"/>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''Hisildi'' is in [[Qenya]]. It is glossed as \"Twilight People, Dark Elves\", possibly being an elaboration on ''[[hísë]]'' (\"dusk\").<ref name=\"His\">{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1409623743.html|articlename=ᴱQ.

The first part of the name, ''[[lómear]]'', is glossed as \"Child of Gloom\" in the ''[[Qenya Lexicon]]'', a combination of ''[[lómë]]'' (\"gloom\") and ''[[ar (Qenya word)|ar]]'' (\"child\"); with ''Lómëarni'' being the plural form of ''Lómëar''.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3200922741.html|articlename=ᴱQ.
