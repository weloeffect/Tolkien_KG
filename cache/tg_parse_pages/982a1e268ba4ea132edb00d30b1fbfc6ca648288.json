The [[Orcs#Other writings|Goblins]] got the North Polar Bear lost by imitating Mr Cave Bear's voice and misleading him. He realized light was needed so he found [[Father Christmas]] and informed him that the North Polar Bear was lost and brought him to the caves and together they were able to rescue him.<ref name=l32b/>\n\nWhen Father Christmas discovered their cellar had been emptied and a tunnel had been dug into it (one too small for them to fit through), they rushed to find Mr Cave Bear, and in the caves, they discovered that the tunnels had been built by the Goblins. Because of the North Polar Bear being lost and presents being stolen by the Goblins, there was a great rush to be prepared for Christmas and Mr Cave Bear along with the Gnome-ladies helped out.<ref name=l32b/>\n\nA boxing-day party was thrown in 1934 and Mr Cave Bear and his nephews were invited.<ref name=l34b>{{LFC|1934b}}</ref>\n==Characteristics==\nMr Cave Bear was the eldest of the now dwindling Cave-bears. He was described by Father Christmas as \"very fat and funny-shaped\".<ref name=l34b/> In a drawing made by Father Christmas he is shown to be brown-furred and not very large.<ref>{{LFC|1934b}}, [https://tolkiengateway.net/w/images/6/66/J.R.R._Tolkien_-_Caves.png Drawing of the caves]</ref>  He owned (or at least claimed to own) and lived in caves near the [[Christmas House]]. These caves had apparently been owned by his \"great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great (multiplied by ten) grandfather\".  Living in a cave, he could see well in the dark. He had several sons, grandchildren<ref name=l32b>{{LFC|1932b}}</ref> and nephews.<ref name=l34b/>\n{{References|notes}}\n{{WLFC}}\n[[Category:Characters in Letters from Father Christmas]]"}}}
