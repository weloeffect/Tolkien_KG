It was the home of [[Durin I]], the first of the [[Fathers of the Dwarves]]. He began to work on the mansions after finding caves in the [[Misty Mountains]]. Thus became King Durin I of Khazad-dûm and ruled Durin's Folk for many years, causing him to be named \"Durin the Deathless\" until he died during the [[First Age]]. Afterwards, other rulers of Khazad-dûm were sometimes named Durin, as they were considered to be his reincarnations, who the dwarves believed came to live again among his people.<ref name=\"Durin\">{{App|Durin}}</ref>\n\nThe Dwarves of Khazad-dûm also [[Dwarves of the Iron Hills|colonized]] the [[Iron Hills]], which became Durin's Folk's primary source of iron-ore.<ref name=relations>{{PM|Relations}}, pp. 302-303</ref>\n\nThe Dwarves also built a stone-bridge over the [[Anduin]] and the first miles of the [[Old Forest Road]] into the [[Greenwood]].<ref name=NM>{{NM|P3xx}}</ref>\n\n===Second Age===\nIn the second age, the Dwarves were joined by the [[Dwarves of the Blue Mountains]], fleeing the ruin of [[Belegost]] and [[Nogrod]]. Their numbers were enriched by them, as well as their craft and skill.\n\nAround that time, Khazad-dûm was in a confederation with [[Men]] of the [[Vales of Anduin]], where the Men provided food in return for Dwarven weapons and precious items. This cooperation continued until the reign of [[Durin IV]].<ref name=\"Dwarves\">{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref>  \n\nAlso fleeing the destruction, the [[Noldor]] founded a country of their own by the western gate of Khazad-dûm, [[Eregion]]. A rare friendship sprang up between the Dwarves and the Elves of this new land. By that time, Khazad-dûm had expanded so much that it completely traversed the Mountains from east to west, ending to the western rocky cliffs at their base, the [[Walls of Moria]].<ref name=Journey>{{FR|II4}}</ref> [[Narvi]] with Eregion's ruler, [[Celebrimbor]], constructed the magical [[Doors of Durin|West-gate of Moria]], and indeed Celebrimbor went so far as to present King [[Durin III]] with an Elven [[Rings of Power|Ring of Power]].<ref name=\"Durin\"/> \n\nThe friendship of Khazad-dûm and Eregion came to a sudden end, however, in {{SA|1697}}. [[Sauron]] [[Sack of Eregion|overran]] the country of the Elves, and despite the best efforts of the Dwarves to help them, he succeeded in destroying Eregion and driving away  the survivors. Durin sent a great force of Dwarves to protect the Doors of Durin, but with the Elves dead or fleeing far away his warriors withdrew and the gates to the city were shut against Sauron, also secluding the kingdom off from the outside world<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref> and communication with their [[Dwarves of the Iron Hills|kinsmen]] in the [[Iron Hills]] was cut off.<ref>{{PM|Relations}}, p. 306</ref> \n\nTheir seclusion was broken for a time with the beginning of the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. The Dwarves of Moria fought alongside the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] in their campaign to defeat Sauron for the last time.<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref> With the conclusion of the War the Dwarves went back to their city.\n\n===Third Age===\nThe Dwarves of Moria remained secured and safe since the [[Dark Years]], until their numbers dwindled and many of its mansions emptied.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> Most of the Dwarves's great wealth was based on the ''[[Mithril]]'' that was found in the mines of Moria, and as the centuries passed, they mined deeper and deeper for the precious metal. In the year {{TA|1980}}, they dug too deep, and unleashed a nameless terror from the depths beneath the city. The creature wreaked dreadful destruction, and in slaying the King, [[Durin VI]], became known as [[Durin's Bane]]. In the following year, Durin's son, [[Náin I]], was also lost, and the Dwarves fled their ancient home. \n\nThe Dwarven people separated and joined [[Dwarves of the Grey Mountains|their folk]] at the [[Grey Mountains]] although others followed the King to [[Erebor]] to found [[Kingdom under the Mountain|another Kingdom]].\n\nDescendants of the Dwarves of Moria, [[Bifur]], [[Bofur]] and [[Bombur]],<ref name=\"Durin\"/> and some members of the [[House of Durin]], [[Thorin and Company|joined]] King in exile [[Thorin II Oakenshield]] to reclaim Erebor in {{TA|2941}}.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Balin's folk]]\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Dwarven peoples]]\n[[de:Khazad-dûm]]\n[[fi:Moria]]"}}}
