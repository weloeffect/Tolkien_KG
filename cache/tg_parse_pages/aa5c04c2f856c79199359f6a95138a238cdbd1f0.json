I do not ask for such a gift. But you commanded me to name my desire'.}}\n\nGaladriel's response surprised all of the [[Elves]]: she granted Gimli's wish and gave him three golden strands of her hair, which Gimli promised to set in crystal as a \"''pledge of goodwill between the Mountain and the Wood until the end of days.''\"<ref>{{FR|II8}}, p. 376</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn the early drafts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', there is no dialogue between Galadriel and Gimli when she is giving her gifts to the Company.<ref>{{TI|XIV}}, Notes, p. 290, note 21</ref> In the following draft, when Gimli is asked, he answers to Galadriel that he is contented with having seen her. Then she took a brooch off herself, an emerald set in gold, and gave it to him. Gimli tried to apply the name ''[[Elfstone]]'' to himself, but he was stopped by [[J.R.R.
