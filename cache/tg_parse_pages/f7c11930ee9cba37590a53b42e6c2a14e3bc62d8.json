Sometime later, this brood was taken by the [[Dark Lord]], who \"nursed it with fell meats\" until they grew larger than every other winged creature.<ref name=\"pelennor\" />\n\nIn the year {{TA|3018}} of the late [[Third Age]], the [[Nazgûl]] rode black [[horses]] in their pursuit of [[Frodo Baggins]]. These horses were killed when they and their riders were washed away by [[Elrond]]'s flood at the [[Ford of Bruinen]].<ref>{{FR|Flight}}</ref> However, the Nazgûl survived; over the next few months made their way unseen to [[Mordor]], where [[Sauron]] gave them fell beasts to serve as new steeds.<ref name=\"pelennor\" />\n\nWhen the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] had left [[Lothlórien]] and were camped on the western shore of the river [[Anduin]] near [[Sarn Gebir]], a winged creature tried to approach them at night.

They described it as being a darkness in the shape of a monstrous bird. After this, [[Gandalf]] told the [[Rohirrim]] to assemble at [[Dunharrow]] rather than outside Edoras to prevent any attack. Three days later in the evening of [[9 March]], [[Dúnhere]], the lord of [[Harrowdale]], reported the incident to [[King of Rohan|King]] [[Théoden]], who had just returned from the [[Hornburg]].<ref name=\"harrowdale\" />\n\nWhen [[Faramir]], captain of [[Gondor]], was fleeing from the besieged city of [[Osgiliath]] on his way to [[Minas Tirith]], he and his men were beset many times by five winged creatures ridden by Nazgûl until Gandalf rode out and drove them away with a shaft of white light from his raised hand.<ref name=\"siege\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]] rode his winged steed in battle against King Théoden; the Witch-king shot a dart which killed Théoden's [[Snowmane|horse]], who fell upon him, mortally wounding him. [[Éowyn]] removed her guise as Dernhelm and defended the dying Théoden, challenging and decapitating the winged creature.

In the middle Third Age they live in [[Mountains of Mirkwood|mountainous]] areas of Mirkwood, presumably because of the [[Sauron#Sauron's Return|Necromancer]]'s presence at [[Dol Guldur]].

As opposed to having beaks, they have lipless mouths full of jagged teeth, fins running along their spine, long whip-like tails and dark gray scales. This depiction is heavily influenced by [[John Howe]], who was one of the concept artists for the films.\n\n:In the films, the fell beasts are used for attack much more often than in the books, with the Nazgûl usually swooping down and screeching, making the defenders at the gate of Minas Tirith run away, leaving [[Gandalf]] alone to face the Witch-king as he enters.\n\n:Although on screen the films never make this mistake, sometimes cast or crew members ([[Lawrence Makoare]] and [[Richard Taylor]] most notably) on the commentary tracks and the documentaries refer to the fell beasts as Nazgûl; this is incorrect.

During the second and final phase, it flies into the sky and shoots green fireballs from its mouth down at Aragorn (who shoots back at it with his bow), until it is weakened and finally shot down by Legolas in the game's ending cutscene.\n\n'''2002-5: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game]]'':'''\n:Hell-hawks, employed as mounts by the Ringwraiths and found wild in southern Mirkwood and (after the War of the Ring) in Gondor, resemble a \"cross between lizards and featherless birds\".
