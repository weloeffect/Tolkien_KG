It was given to the Noldor in the lands of [[Araman]] north of [[Valinor]] as a warning of the woe that would come upon them if they continued in their rebellion against the Valar and did not repent of their killing of the innocent [[Falmari]]n Elves. The Doom was believed to have been spoken personally by [[Mandos]]. \n\n==The Doom==\nThe Doom was as follows:{{blockquote|[[Nirnaeth Arnoediad|Tears unnumbered]] ye shall shed; and the Valar will [[Nurtale Valinoreva|fence Valinor]] against you, and shut you out, so that not even the echo of your lamentation shall pass over [[Pelóri|the mountains]]. On the [[House of Fëanor]] the wrath of the Valar lieth from the [[Uttermost West|West]] unto the [[uttermost East]], and upon all that will follow them it shall be laid also. Their [[Oath of Fëanor|Oath]] shall drive them, and yet betray them, and ever snatch away the very [[Silmarils|treasures]] that they have sworn to pursue. To evil end shall all things turn that they begin well; and by treason of kin unto kin, and the fear of treason, shall this come to pass. The Dispossessed shall they be for ever.<br />\nYe have spilled the blood of your kindred unrighteously and have stained the land of Aman. For blood ye shall render blood, and beyond Aman ye shall dwell in Death's shadow. For though [[Eru]] appointed to you to die not in [[Eä]], and no sickness may assail you, yet slain ye may be, and slain ye shall be: by weapon and by torment and by grief; and your houseless spirits shall come then to Mandos. There long shall ye abide and yearn for your bodies, and find little pity though all whom ye have slain should entreat for you. And those that endure in [[Middle-earth]] and come not to [[Halls of Mandos|Mandos]] shall grow weary of the world as with a great burden, and shall wane, and become as shadows of regret before the [[Men|younger race]] that cometh after. The Valar have spoken.|''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', \"[[Of the Flight of the Noldor]]\"}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Jenny Dolfen - A Tapestry of Sorrows.jpg|thumb|right|''A Tapestry of Sorrows'' by [[Jenny Dolfen]]]]\nThe pronouncement of this Doom was the immediate cause for the full repentance of [[Finarfin]] - who was already reluctant to proceed - and his followers. They would soon return to [[Tirion]], where they asked and received the forgiveness of the Valar.<ref name=\"Flight\">{{S|Flight}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the majority of the Noldor - as well as the [[Vanya]] [[Elenwë]], who accompanied her Noldorin spouse, [[Turgon]] - continued on their way to [[Beleriand]] to fight [[Morgoth]]<ref name=\"Flight\" />. The disastrous [[Wars of Beleriand|wars]] they waged there fulfilled the prophetic Doom.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref><ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>\n\nMost would not survive, and forgiveness and pardon for the exiles did not come until the [[War of Wrath]] that ended the [[First Age]]. Even then, some few chose not to return, but remained in [[Middle-earth]].<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', an early version of the Doom of Mandos is spoken by a servant of [[Vefántur]], who saw the exiled [[Noldoli]] as they journeyed towards the [[Helkaraksë]]. He foretold of evil things to come, and ended with the words, \"''Great is the fall of [[Gondolin]]''\". This was remembered by the Noldoli as the Prophecies of [[Amnos]], named for the place in which the words were spoken.<ref>{{LT1|VII}}, p. 167</ref> It is to be noted this was a foretelling rather than a curse, and was not spoken by Vefántur (Mandos) himself.\n\nIn the tale of ''[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]'', [[Turgon]] spoke the same words, \"''Great is the fall of Gondolin''\", which were recognized as \"the words of [[Amnon]] the prophet of old\". A few jottings by [[Tolkien]] in a notebook also reference a Prophecy of Amnon, but these are unclear as to whether Amnon is a person or a place.<ref>{{LT1|VIIn}}, p. 172</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Second Prophecy of Mandos]]\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:First Age]]\n[[Category:Noldor]]\n[[Category:Oaths and prophecies]]\n[[de:Spruch der Noldor]]\n[[fi:Mandosin Kirous]]"}}}
