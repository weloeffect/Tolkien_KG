The beauty of it smote his heart, as he looked up out of the forsaken land, and hope returned to him.

This idea is best understood as ''trust'' or \"''faith''\", and the hope that comes from it: ''estel'' refers to the belief that [[Eru Ilúvatar]], the Creator of the Universe ([[Eä]]), is good and that his designs for his creatures will ultimately be good as well, despite the troubles that seem to plague [[Arda]], this world. Certain knowledge of what is to happen to the Elves after the end of Arda has thus been withheld from them, so that all they can rely on is ''estel''. The Elven-king [[Finrod Felagund]] explained estel as an idea that \"is not defeated by the ways of the world, for it does not come from experience, but from our nature and first being. If we are indeed the [[Eruhíni|Eruchin]], the Children of the One, then He will not suffer Himself to be deprived of His own, not by any Enemy, not even by ourselves\".\n\nEstel is also connected to the more immediate hope found in the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] that keeps them from being overcome by the hardships of [[Arda Marred]]; the [[Valar]] refer to this gift as the ability to appreciate \"the Unmarred that they discern in the Marred\".<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), ''[[Morgoth's Ring]]'', \"Part three. [[The Later Quenta Silmarillion]]. II The Second Phase. Laws and customs among the Eldar\", p.245.</ref> That is, the Children of Ilúvatar can see what is good about Arda in its present state, despite its corruption by [[Morgoth]]. It's ''estel'' that gives them this ability.\n\n''Estel'' is similar to, but more based on the heart than, ''[[amdir]]'', another Sindarin word that can be translated as \"hope\".<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), ''[[Morgoth's Ring]]'', \"Part four. [[Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth]]: \"The Debate of Finrod and Andreth\".</ref>\n\n==''Estel'' in Arda's History==\n{{Quote|\"In the armour of Fate there is ever a rift, and in the walls of Doom a breach, until [[the End]]. So it shall be while I endure, a secret voice that gainsayeth, and a light where darkness was decreed.\"|[[Ulmo]]<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>}}\n\nAccording to the Elvish tradition, ''estel'' was one of only two things Eru demanded from his Children; the other was belief that he existed in the first place. Lack of estel was seen as a fault in the ''[[fëa]]'' of a person, and could have grave consequences: the most drastic example of a being lacking in ''estel'' is none other than that of Morgoth himself; his denial of the greatness of Eru led to his nihilism and despair. The failing of ''estel'' found in [[Finwë]], the first [[High King of the Noldor]], of his wife [[Míriel]] ever returning to him from the Halls of [[Mandos]] is another example. Finwë's decision to take another wife led to the strife between his sons that was instrumental to the tragic [[Fall of the Noldor]]. Ultimately, most poor choices of Elves and [[Men]] come from a failing in ''estel''.\n\n==''Estel'' and Men==\n\nUnlike the Elves, the foundation of estel in Men was said to have been shaken because of [[Tale of Adanel|their corruption by Morgoth]] in the earliest days of their race. Because they had denied the supremacy of Eru and taken Melkor as their God, they could no longer believe with certainty that Eru would accept them. This lack of estel in Men had an effect on their view of their mortality, which was originally their [[Gift of Men|Gift]] from Eru.\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n\nIn an early version of the ''[[Many Partings]]'' chapter, [[Gandalf]] gives to [[Frodo]] and [[Sam]] the names ''Bronwe athan Harthad'' (\"Endurance beyond hope\") and ''Hartad Uluithiad'' (\"Hope unquenchable\"), with ''Harthad'' being the [[Noldorin]] word for hope.<ref>{{SD|VII}}</ref>\n{{references}}\n{{title|lowercase}}\n[[Category:Aliases]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n[[Category:Sindarin nouns]]\n[[Category:Quenya nouns]]"}}}
