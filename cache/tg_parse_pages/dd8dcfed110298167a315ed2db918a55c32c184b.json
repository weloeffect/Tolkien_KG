Chisholm has written several articles on [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[C.S. Lewis]], and [[the Inklings]]. Much of his present scholarship springs from [http://www.redmonky.net/utpa/4324/poulakos.pdf John Poulakos's theory of rhetorical possibility], and Chisholm is working on a book that uses C.S. Lewis' ideas on children's storytelling to develop a theory of possibility to reexamine classical children's literature. In 2013, Chisholm was awarded a dissertation fellowship to complete his dissertation on \"rhetoric-oriented approaches to juvenile texts,” which he successfully defended in November of that year. \n\n== Bibliography, selected ==\n=== Articles ===\n* [[2008]]: [[Mallorn 45|''Mallorn'' 45]]\n** \"Winston and Frodo: Demons, Choices and Grace in ''The Lord of the Rings''\"\n* [[2010]]: [[Mallorn 50|''Mallorn'' 50]]\n** \"The wizard and the rhetor: rhetoric and the ethos of Middle-earth in ''The Hobbit''\"\n\n=== Reviews ===\n* [[2009]]: [[Mallorn 48|''Mallorn'' 48]]:\n** \"Hunting Peter Jackson\"\n* [[2010]]: [[Mallorn 49|''Mallorn'' 49]]:\n** \"The Shape of a Story\"\n* [[2010]]: [[Mallorn 50|''Mallorn'' 50]]:\n** \"Flights of Fantasy\"\n* [[2011]]: [[Mallorn 51|''Mallorn'' 51]]:\n** \"Keeping the Faith\"\n* [[2011]]: [[Mallorn 52|''Mallorn'' 52]]:\n** \"The lion, the witch, and the baffled producers\"\n* [[2013]]: [[Mallorn 54|''Mallorn'' 54]]:\n** \"Death of The Hobbit\"\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chisholm, Chris}}\n[[Category:American people]]\n[[Category:Authors]]\n[[Category:People by name]]"}}}
