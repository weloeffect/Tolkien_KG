Tolkien]] part of his series [[Tales and Songs of Bimble Bay]] written around [[1928]]. It was first published in ''[[The Collected Poems of J.R.R. Tolkien]]''. There are two manuscripts of the poem, and the first was called \"Poor Old Grabbler\". It is about two older residents, Mrs. Day and Grabbler, of Bimble Bay, an imaginary English seaside town. It is a somber poem that laments the degradation of the environment around them in their old age compared to their youth.\n\n{{blockquote|And Grabbler was young and followed after<br />\nAnd wandered in lands all clean and wild.'<br />\n\nBut all these places are now defiled:<br />\nEverywhere, everywhere paper-bags,<br />\nAnd banana-skins, and yellowing rags<br />\nOf picture-papers, and stumps of fags;<br />\nAnd over dark hills the honk of horn.<ref>{{CP|106}}, pp. 740-3</ref>|Lines 44-50}}\n\n\n==See also==\n*[[Index:Poems by J.R.R.
