Soon after the defeat of [[Sauron]] at the end of the [[Second Age]], Isildur and his three elder sons all perished in the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]].<ref>{{UT|Gladden}}</ref>\n\nIsildur's only remaining Heir was [[Valandil (King of Arnor)|Valandil]], kept safe in [[Rivendell]] but only eleven years old at that time, and unable to take up his rule. So, Isildur's nephew [[Meneldil]] took control of the kingdom of Gondor, and the Two Kingdoms split from one another as Gondor's rule went to the [[House of Anárion]]. In the south, Gondor remained strong under the rule of Meneldil's descendants, but the [[Arnor|North-kingdom]] was not so fortunate. The sons of [[Eärendur (King of Arnor)|Eärendur]] quarreled, and while [[Amlaith]] was the Heir of Isildur and his father, the other sons broke the kingdom into three separate realms. Of these, Amlaith ruled [[Arthedain]], the only that [[Kings of Arthedain|was ruled]] by the Heir of Isildur. The other kingdoms were slowly overcome by dark forces of the evil land of [[Angmar]]. By the time [[Argeleb I]] of Arthedain came to power, the line of kings had failed in those kingdoms, so Argeleb claimed sovereignty over all of [[Arnor]]<ref name=\"Eriador\">{{App|Eriador}}</ref> (taking the royal prefix ''[[ar|ar(a)-]]'' as a token of this<ref>{{App|North}}, note 4</ref>).\n\n[[Arvedui]], Isildur's Heir through twenty-three generations, was the last King to rule in the north; he was also notable for marrying [[Fíriel]], daughter of the [[Kings of Gondor|King of Gondor]] [[Ondoher]], thus uniting the [[House of Isildur]] and [[House of Anárion]]. He later attempted to reclaim the [[High King of the Dúnedain|High Kingship]], but failed,<ref name=gondor>{{App|Gondor}}</ref> and the last remnant of royal Arnor was overrun by its enemies.\n\nThough their royal cities were wasted, and their people dwindled, the line of Isildur's Heirs continued for another sixteen generations under the title '[[Chieftains of the Dúnedain|Chieftain of the Dúnedain]]', who were Arvedui's descendants and ruled the remnants of the [[Dúnedain of Arnor]]. When the line of the Kings of Gondor also failed and the [[Ruling Steward]]s ruled the Kingdom, it was the Chieftains who held the line of Anárion alive, but they were hidden in the north, forgotten by all except in [[Rivendell|Imladris]] where heirs of Isildur were harboured as well as their heirlooms were kept.<ref name=gondor/>\n\nThe Heir of Isildur was a target of [[Sauron]], if any remained in [[Middle-earth]]; when [[Arathorn II]] died, the [[Wise]] decided to protect his son [[Aragorn]] by raising him without telling him of his name and heritage.<ref>{{App|Tale}}</ref>\n\nThe last Chieftain was [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]] of the [[War of the Ring]], who famously came to [[Minas Tirith]] and reclaimed the High Kingship of all the western lands as the [[Reunited Kingdom]].<ref name=\"Eriador\"/>\n{{references}}\n{{northernline}}\n[[Category:Dúnedain of the North]]\n[[Category:Mannish titles]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/hommes/3a/dunedain/dunedain du nord/heritier d isildur]]\n[[fi:Isildurin perijä]]"}}}
