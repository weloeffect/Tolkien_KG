Tolkien]]'s '''''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''''' in 26 half-hour stereo instalments.\n\nIt followed [[The Lord of the Rings (1955 radio series)|a previous 12-part BBC Radio version]] from 1955 and 1956, of which no recordings are known to have survived.\n\n==Broadcast history==\n\nEach of the original 26 episodes received two broadcasts per week - standard practice for many BBC radio serials even today. The first broadcast of Episode 2 was blacked out across a large part of south east England because of a transmitter failure (a very rare occurrence even then).\n\n\nThe 26-part series was subsequently edited into 13 hour-long episodes, restoring some dialogue originally cut for timing (since each hour-long episode is actually around 57 minutes, as opposed to 54 minutes for two half-hour episodes), rearranging some scenes for dramatic impact and adding linking narration and music cues. It was broadcast in 13 episodes in [[1982]].\n\nThe re-edited version was released on both cassette tape and CD sets which also included the soundtrack album (noticeably taken from a vinyl copy).\n\nA soundtrack album featuring a completely re-recorded and in some cases expanded, suite of [[Stephen Oliver]]'s music was released in 1981.\n\n===1981 broadcast===\n#\"The Long Awaited Party\", [[8 March|March 8]]\n#\"The Shadow Of The Past\", [[15 March|March 15]]\n#\"The Black Riders\", [[22 March|March 22]]\n#\"Trouble At The Prancing Pony\", [[29 March|March 29]]\n#\"The Knife In The Dark\", [[5 April|April 5]]\n#\"The Council Of Elrond\", [[12 April|April 12]]\n#\"The Fellowship Of The Ring\", [[19 April|April 19]]\n#\"The Mines Of Moria\", [[26 April|April 26]]\n#\"The Mirror Of Galadriel\", [[3 May|May 3]]\n#\"The Breaking Of The Fellowship\", [[10 May|May 10]]\n#\"The Riders Of Rohan\", [[17 May|May 17]]\n#\"Treebeard Of Fangorn\", \"[[24 May|May 24]]\n#\"The King Of The Golden Hall\", [[31 May|May 31]]\n#\"Helm's Deep\", [[7 June|June 7]]\n#\"The Voice Of Saruman\", [[14 June|June 14]]\n#\"The Black Gate Is Closed\", [[21 June|June 21]]\n#\"The Window On The West\", [[28 June|June 28]]\n#\"Minas Tirith\", [[5 July|July 5]]\n#\"Shelob's Lair\", [[12 July|July 12]]\n#\"The Siege Of Gondor\", [[19 July|July 19]]\n#\"The Battle Of Pelennor Fields\", [[26 July|July 26]]\n#\"The Houses Of Healing\", [[2 August|August 2]]\n#\"Mount Doom\", [[9 August|August 9]]\n#\"The Return Of The King\", [[16 August|August 16]]\n#\"Homeward Bound\", [[23 August|August 23]]\n#\"The Grey Havens\", [[30 August|August 30]]\n\n===1982 broadcast===\n#\"The Shadow Of The Past\", [[17 July|July 17]]\n#\"The Black Riders\", [[24 July|July 24]]\n#\"The Knife In The Dark\", [[31 July|July 31]]\n#\"The Ring Goes South\", [[7 August|August 7]]\n#\"The Mirror Of Galadriel\", [[14 August|August 14]]\n#\"The Breaking Of The Fellowship\", [[21 August|August 21]]\n#\"The King Of The Golden Hall\", [[28 August|August 28]]\n#\"The Voice Of Saruman\", [[4 September|September 4]]\n#\"The Two Towers\", [[11 September|September 11]]\n#\"The Choices Of Master Samwise\", [[18 September|September 18]]\n#\"The Battle Of Pelennor Fields\", [[25 September|September 25]]\n#\"Mount Doom\", [[2 October|October 2]]\n#\"The Grey Havens\", [[9 October|October 9]]\n\n==Differences from the book==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings 1981 Music by Stephen Oliver.jpg|thumb|Vinyl with the soundtrack by [[Stephen Oliver]]]]\nThe script by [[Brian Sibley]] and [[Michael Bakewell]] attempts to be as faithful as possible to the original books, but there are some errors and alterations. They include:\n\n*Scenes are added at the beginning featuring [[Gollum]]'s torture in [[Barad-dûr|Barad-Dur]] and adapting the riddle-game from [[The Hobbit]].\n*The old miller [[Sandyman]] is omitted with his lines given to his son.\n*[[Fredegar Bolger]] is entirely omitted\n*Gandalf's imprisonment at [[Isengard]], escape via [[Gwaihir]], and his visit to [[Edoras]] are incorporated into the narrative rather then being related at the [[Council of Elrond]].\n*The [[Nazgûl]]'s visit to Isengard in search of information on the Shire and their encounter with [[Gríma]] is adapted from [[Unfinished Tales]].\n*[[Gildor|Gildor Inglorion]] does not appear in the story.\n*The radio serial omits the sequence in the book in which the hobbits visit with [[Tom Bombadil]]. However, in doing so, the Hobbits are never shown to receive their [[Barrow-blade|swords]] from the [[Barrow-downs]], which are enchanted with spells that are proof against the [[Witch-king|Lord of the Nazgûl]]. This leaves later references to Frodo having a sword before [[Sting]] and where the swords of the other Hobbits came from unexplained. Sibley acknowledges this later, when Merry stabs him during the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. Instead of being weakened as in the book, he merely says Merry stings like a gnat. However the Mouth of Sauron still describes Sam's blade as a \"Sword of the Downfallen West\".\n*[[Glóin|Gloin]]'s appearance at Rivendell is cut.\n*Any mention of [[Dáin Ironfoot]] is omitted with [[Gimli]] stating his father Gloin was the one who met with Sauron's messenger.\n*[[Durin's Bane]] is mistakenly stated to be a \"servant of Sauron\"\n*[[Morgoth]] is oddly referred to by his original name Melkor when [[Legolas]] is discussing the origin of Orcs and when Gandalf refers to Durin's Bane as a \"Spawn of Melkor\".\n*[[Gandalf]]'s physical death is omitted from his account of his battle with Durin's Bane with no mention of his being \"sent back back\", with the script implying he was merely wounded. Though later when confronting Saruman, Gandalf claims he returned from death.\n*[[Quickbeam]] the Ent does not appear in the story.\n\n*At one point when Gandalf is listing the locations of the [[Palantíri]],  [[Minas Anor]] and [[Minas Tirith]] are referred to as though they were separate cities; these are merely alternate names for the same city. Later Gandalf does refer correctly to the Palantír of Minas Tirith as the \"Stone of Anor.\"\n*[[Beregond]] has his role from the book entirely cut and only appears as the anonymous messenger who brings news of the battle to [[Denethor]].\n\n*Part of the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields|Battle of Pelennor Fields]] sequence is described in song by an opera-style vocalist rather than acted, which may distance some listeners from the action. Others may find the kinship between the sequence and Eddic style of storytelling interesting.\n\n*The journey through [[Drúadan Forest]] and the subsequent alliance with [[Ghân-buri-Ghân]]'s wild men, or \"woses\" is removed from the radio drama.\n*The journey of the army from Minas Tirith to the Morannon is cut including the restoration of the statue at the crossroads and departure of the faint-hearted\n*The [[Battle of the Morannon]] is almost entirely cut, including Pippin slaying a troll.\n*[[Galadriel]] and Celeborn do not attend the wedding of Aragorn and Arwen\n*Legolas and Gimli's visit to the [[Glittering Caves]] is omitted \n*The encounter with Saruman and Wormtongue on the way back to Rivendell is omitted.\n*[[The Scouring of the Shire]] is significantly cut down. The journey from the [[Brandywine Bridge]] to Hobbiton is skipped over and the Sheriffs are cut.  The Hobbiton and Bywater segments are conflated so the [[Battle of Bywater]] takes place in Hobbiton. \n*[[Círdan]] is omitted\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|- \n!Role!!Actor\n|-\n|Narrator||[[Gerard Murphy]]\n|-\n|[[Frodo Baggins]]||[[Ian Holm]]\n|-\n|[[Gandalf|Gandalf the Grey]]||[[Michael Hordern]]\n|-\n|[[Aragorn]]||[[Robert Stephens]]\n|-\n|[[Samwise Gamgee]]||[[Bill Nighy|William Nighy]]\n|-\n|[[Boromir]]||[[Michael Graham Cox]]\n|-\n|[[Bilbo Baggins]]||[[John Le Mesurier]]\n|-\n|[[Gollum|Gollum/Sméagol]]||[[Peter Woodthorpe]]\n|-\n|[[Gimli]]||[[Douglas Livingstone]]\n|-\n|[[Meriadoc Brandybuck]]||[[Richard O'Callaghan]]\n|-\n|[[Legolas]]||[[David Collings]]\n|-\n|[[Faramir]]||[[Andrew Seear]]\n|-\n|[[Saruman|Saruman the White]]||[[Peter Howell]]\n|-\n|[[Denethor]]||[[Peter Vaughan]]\n|-\n|[[Witch-king|Lord of the Nazgûl]]||[[Philip Voss]]\n|-\n|[[Elrond]]||[[Hugh Dickson]]\n|-\n|[[Éomer]]||[[Anthony Hyde]]\n|-\n|[[Éowyn]]||[[Elin Jenkins]]\n|-\n|[[Théoden]]||[[Jack May]]\n|-\n|[[Peregrin Took]]||[[John McAndrew]]\n|-\n|[[Galadriel]]||[[Marian Diamond]]\n|-\n|[[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]]||[[Paul Brooke]]\n|-\n|[[Odo Proudfoot]]||[[Sean Arnold]]\n|-\n|[[Gamling]]||[[Patrick Barr]]\n|-\n|[[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins]]||Diana Bishop\n|-\n|[[Farmer Maggot]]||[[John Bott]]\n|-\n|[[Ruffians|Ruffian]]||John Bott\n|-\n|[[Celeborn]]||[[Simon Cadell]]\n|-\n|[[Gaffer Gamgee]]||[[John Church]]\n|-\n|The Bard||Oz Clarke\n|-\n|[[Tolman Cotton Senior|Farmer Cotton]]||Alan Dudley\n|-\n|[[Shagrat]]||[[Chris Fairbank]]\n|-\n|[[Déagol]]||[[Graham Faulkner]]\n|-\n|[[Bill Ferny]]||Graham Faulkner\n|-\n|[[Daddy Twofoot]]||[[Leonard Fenton]]\n|-\n|[[Arwen|Arwen Evenstar]]||[[Sonia Fraser]]\n|-\n|[[Radagast]]||[[Donald Gee]]\n|-\n|[[Barliman Butterbur]]||[[James Grout]]\n|-\n|[[Uglúk]]||[[Brian Haines]]\n|-\n|[[Rose Cotton]]||[[Kathryn Hurlbutt]]\n|-\n|The Eagle||David James\n|-\n|[[Gwaihir]]||[[Alexander John]]\n|-\n|[[Ioreth]]||[[Pauline Letts]]\n|-\n|[[Éothain]]||[[John Livesey]]\n|-\n|[[Otho Sackville-Baggins]]||John Livesey\n|-\n|[[Ceorl]]||[[Michael McStay]]\n|-\n|[[Halbarad]]||[[Martyn Read]]\n|-\n|[[Sandyman]]||[[Gordon Reid]]\n|-\n|[[Snaga (orc of Isengard)|Snaga of Isengard]]||Gordon Reid\n|-\n|[[Snaga (orc of Mordor)|Snaga of Mordor]]||Gordon Reid\n|-\n|[[The Mouth of Sauron]]||[[John Rye]]\n|-\n|[[Beregond]]||[[Christopher Scott]]\n|-\n|[[Gorbag]]||David Sinclair\n|-\n|[[Háma]]||[[Michael Spice]]\n|-\n|[[Treebeard]]||[[Stephen Thorne]]\n|-\n|[[Glorfindel]]||[[John Webb]]\n|-\n|[[Haldir]]||[[Haydn Wood]]\n|-\n|[[Nob]]||Haydn Wood\n|}\n\n==Re-release in 2002==\nIn 2002, to coincide with the release of Peter Jackson's [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]], the BBC reissued the series in three sets corresponding to the three original volumes (''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', ''[[The Two Towers]]'' and ''[[The Return of the King]]'').\n\nThis version omitted the original episode divisions, and included a new opening and closing narration for the first two sets, and an opening narration only for the last, recorded by Ian Holm in character as Frodo Baggins - Frodo's narrations deal with his efforts to write his historical account of the War of the Ring in the [[Red Book]], as well as his own personal reflections and musings on the story's events.\n\nThe re-edited version also included some additional music cues, which had to be taken from the soundtrack album because the original master tapes for the series music had been lost.\n\nThe soundtrack, now digitally remastered, was also included with ''The Return of the King'' set, with a demo of John Le Mesurier singing ''[[Bilbo's Last Song]]'' included as a bonus track. \n\nThe 13-episode series was also rerun on Radio 4 in 2002.\n\n==External links==\n*{{WP|The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)}}\n*[http://briansibleytheworks.blogspot.com.br/2008/01/this-page-is-still-under-construction_23.html The Making of BBC Radio's ''The Lord of the Rings''] by Brian Sibley\n*[http://wayneandchristina.wordpress.com/2015/02/27/i-didnt-know-what-i-was-getting-into/ I Didn’t Know What I Was Getting Into] by [[Christina Scull]]\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Radio adaptations]]\n[[de:The Lord of the Rings (Hörspiel, 1981)]]"}}}
