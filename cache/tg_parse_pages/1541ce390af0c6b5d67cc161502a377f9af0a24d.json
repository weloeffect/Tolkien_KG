His leaves were of dark green, shining silver beneath, and his boughs were decked with brilliant flowers that shed a rain of silver dew, which was collected as a source of water and of light.<ref name=Days>{{S|Days}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nTelperion was the elder of the Two Trees, and created by the [[Vala]] [[Yavanna]]. It bloomed during the first part of the Valian day, followed by [[Laurelin]]. It endured throughout the [[Years of the Trees]], but came to an end in the dreadful [[Darkening of Valinor]]. \n\nHowever one of Telperion's flowers survived the Darkening, and was set aloft by the Valar; this was the light of the [[Moon]], carried by [[Tilion]] the [[Maia]].<ref>{{S|11}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[First Age]], [[Turgon]] made images of the Two Trees that stood in his court of [[Gondolin]], and the one made in memory of Telperion was [[Belthil]].<ref>{{S|15}}</ref>\n\n===Telperion's descendants===\nEven though the elder tree did not survive, he was not the last of the White Trees. Because the Elves that first came to Valinor especially loved Telperion, Yavanna made a second tree like it to stand in the city of [[Tirion]] where the [[Vanyar]] and [[Noldor]] dwelt together at first. This tree, named ''[[Galathilion]]'', was identical to Telperion except that it gave no light of its own. It had many seedlings, one of which was [[Celeborn (White Tree)|Celeborn]] on the isle of [[Tol Eressëa]].<ref>{{S|5}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Second Age]], a seedling of Celeborn was brought as a gift to the [[Númenoreans]] — that was [[Nimloth of Númenor|Nimloth]], the White Tree of [[Númenor]]. It lasted through the vast majority of the realm's duration, but when [[Sauron]] took control of the island he had king [[Ar-Pharazôn]] chop it down. Fortunately, [[Isildur]] managed to save a single fruit of that tree. Of this fruit later came the [[White Tree of Gondor]].<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Telperion'' comes from the root ''[[telepi]]''/''[[telpë]]'' (\"silver\").<ref>{{S|Appendix}} ''celeb-''</ref> The exact etymology of the ending ''-rion'' is not clear.

The [[Sindarin]] equivalent of this Quenya name was ''[[Nimloth of Númenor|Nimloth]]'', and indeed that name was inherited by the White Tree that grew in the [[King's Court]] of [[Númenor]].\n\n'''''Ibrīniðilpathānezel''''' was the name in [[Valarin]] of Telperion.<ref>{{WJ|AD1}}, p. 401</ref>\n\nIn early writings of [[J.R.R.
