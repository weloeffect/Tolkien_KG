However, when Ulbar heard of Aldarion's [[Guild of Venturers]] he joined them and became a crewman on the ''[[Hirilondë]]''.  Ulbar was gone for many years until Aldarion brought the ship home from [[Middle-earth]].  He and [[Henderch]] of the Westlands accompanied the prince as Aldarion rode to [[Erendis]]' house.\n\nAfter Aldarion spent a lonely night in a bedchamber separate from his wife he arose early and departed from the house.  Riding to his cousin Hallatan's house he witnessed the gladsome homecoming party that Ulbar's wife was giving him, dancing with him in her happiness.  When Ulbar's son [[Îbal]] asked how old one had to be to go to sea Aldarion gave him a bitter answer but gave Ulbar's wife a ring with a fiery red jewel that King [[Gil-galad]] had given him.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nUlbar's name appears to be [[Adûnaic]], but of unknown definition.\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| ULB | |ULB='''ULBAR'''<br/><small>''fl. {{SA|882|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| |!| | |}}\n{{familytree| ÎBA | |ÎBA=[[Îbal]]<br/><small>''fl. {{SA|882|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Mariners]]\n[[Category:Númenóreans]]\n[[Category:Second Age characters]]"}}}
