I am afraid, however, that I must decline with regret. It's difficult for me to get to Cambridge in term-time, especially in the middle of the week, and I simply have not the time for the composition of any paper or address worthy of your notice and hospitality.<br/><br/>Yours Sincerely,<br/><br/>J.R.R. Tolkien.}}\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Letters|Capan, Mr]]"}}}
