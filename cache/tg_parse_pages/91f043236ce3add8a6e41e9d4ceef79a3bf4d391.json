They are the Deep Elves, and the friends of Aulë. Their lord was Finwë, wisest of all the children of the world. His kindred are renowned in song, for they fought and laboured long and grievously in the northern lands of old.|''[[Morgoth's Ring]]'', \"[[Of the Coming of the Elves]]\"}}\n'''Finwë''' was the first [[King of the Noldor]] and establisher of the [[House of Finwë]] from which branched three other great houses: the [[House of Fëanor]], the [[House of Fingolfin]], and the [[House of Finarfin]].\n\nFinwë was descended of [[Tata]] and [[Tatië]], and thus of the [[Tatyar]] clan. In his youth at [[Cuiviénen]] he was gallant and adventurous, and great friends with [[Elwë]] of the [[Nelyar]] clan. Due to the lies of [[Melkor]], he was initially suspicious of the [[Valar]], but after visiting [[Valinor]] as one of the [[Three Ambassadors]], he became ardently in favour of accepting their invitation for the [[Quendi]] to relocate and join them. On his return, he [[Debate of the Quendi|strongly advocated for migration]] and convinced many to accept. The Tatyar who chose to follow Finwë became known as the [[Noldor]] and he became their first King.\n\nFinwë led his people through the [[Great Journey]] and in [[Eldamar]] established the great city [[Tirion]]. He further played a significant role in bringing the [[Falmari]] to Aman, and constructing their city of [[Alqualondë]].\n\nAfter the birth of his great son, [[Fëanor]], his wife, [[Míriel]] became tired of life and chose to die. Finwë long waited and pleaded for her to return, but eventually lost hope that she would. By [[Statute of Finwë and Míriel|leave of the Valar]], Finwë was permitted to re-marry and took [[Indis]] of the [[Vanyar]] as his second wife: from her he had many additional children, including [[Fingolfin]] and [[Finarfin]].\n\nEventually [[Unchaining of Melkor|Melkor was released]] and he slowly [[Unrest of the Noldor|fomented discontent among the Noldor]]; an especial target of Melkor's was the existing friction between Fëanor and his half-brothers. This finally erupted as a threat of violence by Fëanor against Fingolfin, and Fëanor was subsequently banished from Tirion; Finwë, holding himself unkinged, followed him. Soon after, Melkor returned, with [[Ungoliant]], during a [[High feast#High feast of 1495|great feast]] and first [[Darkening of Valinor|slew the Two Trees]], then slew Finwë, who alone was willing to stand against them.\n\nAfter Finwë's death, he voluntarily forfeited any chance of [[Elven life cycle#Death and reincarnation|reincarnation]] in exchange for Míriel being returned to life.\n\n==History==\n===Early life in Middle-earth===\nAt the beginning of the [[First Age]], the [[Elves]] [[Awakening of the Elves|awoke at Cuiviénen]].<ref name=\"Annals\">{{MR|P2e}}, pp. 71-4</ref> Long they dwelt there, walking the world in wonder, [[Primitive Quendian|making speech]] and naming what they perceived;<ref name=\"captivity\">{{S|Captivity}}</ref> all of [[Arda]] they loved.<ref>{{WJ|Appendix}}</ref>\n\nWithin time though, the Elves were discovered by [[Melkor]], and their natural happiness was dimmed by fear as he sent his shadows to spy on and waylay them, and often Elves who went too far abroad would vanish and never return.<ref name=\"captivity\">{{S|Captivity}}</ref> The younger Elves, in their pride, came to believe that it was ''their mission'' to fight the Dark, and ultimately to posses the world of Arda.<ref name=\"keydates\">{{NM|P1xiii}}</ref> Following this, the Elves were then found by the [[Vala]] [[Oromë]], who dwelt with them awhile before returning back to [[Valinor]] to bring tidings of his discovery.<ref name=\"captivity\" />\n\nFinwë, an Elf of the [[Tatyar]] clan, and a direct descendant of [[Tata]], was born shortly after Oromë's departure. In Oromë's absence, Melkor had his emissaries spread lies among the Elves that the Valar had previously abandoned [[Middle-earth]] and now, jealous to re-posses it, intended to subjugate the Elves as their vassals. Finwë, then a gallant and adventurous young Elf, was much taken with these ideas. Less taken was Finwë's friend [[Elwë]], a descendant of [[Enel]]<ref name=\"keydates\" />{{rp|98-99}} who otherwise shared his adventurous spirit.<ref name=\"genschemes\">{{NM|P1xvii}}</ref>{{rp|132}}\n\n===Serving as an Ambassador===\n[[File:Peter Xavier Price - Ingwe, Finwe and Elwe.jpg|thumb|left|''Ingwe, Finwe and Elwe'' by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]]\nThe Valar, both desiring to protect the Elves from the dangers of the world, and filled with the love of their beauty and desiring their companionship, issued a summons inviting the Elves to [[Aman]] and dwell in the light of the [[Two Trees|Two Trees]].<ref name=\"captivity\" /> Oromë returned to Cuiviénen with this invite and the [[Three Ambassadors]] — [[Ingwë]], Finwë, and Elwë — were elected from their respective kindreds to first journey with him to Valinor and represent their people. At the time of Finwë's departure he was betrothed to [[Míriel]], an Elf maiden devoted to crafts.<ref name=\"keydates\" />{{rp|99}}\n\nOn arriving in Valinor, Finwë, like the other Ambassadors, was dazzled and overawed. While he had initially been the most skeptical, he became the most converted, and longed for Míriel to have the marvelous chance of learning new skills. Elwë, though he preferred the “lesser light, and shadows” of [[Endor]], would follow Finwë his friend. The Ambassadors tarried in Valinor for several years, as Ingwë and Finwë were reluctant to hurry away.<ref name=\"keydates\" />{{rp|99}}\n\nOn the return of the Ambassadors, the Elves held [[Debate of the Quendi|a great debate]] where the Three Ambassadors advocated to relocate to Valinor, while the Three Fathers were against it. Finwë spoke after Ingwë — with less deference towards Tata than Ingwë had showed towards [[Imin]] — and articulated both the riches of knowledge and crafts in Valinor, and the perils of staying in Cuiviénen; he did not, however, disclose his thoughts of the enhancement of his lover Míriel’s skill. Finwë's speech was very effective, as large numbers of the Quendi who could not conceive of Valinor’s attraction were nonetheless frightened of what may befall them if they remained. Elwë declared that he would go with Finwë, but that he chose for none other than himself. After all had finished speaking the Elves held a vote and the majority chose to depart for Valinor, though a very sizable minority chose to remain behind.<ref name=\"keydates\" />{{rp|99-105}}<ref group=\"note\">This may have included the 144 First Elves, with the Three Fathers among them ({{NM|P1xiii}}, p. 100)</ref>\n\nFrom this came the first [[sundering of the Elves]]. Those that chose to depart came to be known as the \"[[Eldar]]\", while those that remained became known as \"[[Avari]]\". Among the Eldarin members of the Tatyar clan the name \"[[Noldor]]\" was accepted and used as their regular and proper name throughout their later history.<ref name=\"clannames\">{{WJ|C}}</ref>{{rp|507}} Ingwë, Finwë, and Elwë were preeminent and obvious leaders: the light of Aman was in their faces and the other Elves were in awe of them.<ref name=\"march\">{{NM|P1vii}}</ref>{{rp|62}} Finwë was thereafter known as the first [[king of the Noldor]].<ref>{{NM|Note}}, \"XVI Galadriel and Celeborn\", note 8</ref>\n\n===Great March=== \n{{Main|Great Journey}}\nThe Eldar thus began their Great Journey and went forth in three hosts, one for each kindred. First came Ingwë's people, the [[Vanyar]]; next were Finwë's, the Noldor; and last were Elwë's, the [[Teleri]]. The Teleri were the greatest host in numbers, and they therefore had a two lords, both Elwë and his younger brother [[Olwë]]. Riding before them all went Oromë.<ref>{{MR|P2g}}, §58</ref>\n\nOver the course of many years the Eldar crossed west through Middle-earth. While there were weddings and begetting of children during the Great March, Finwë was among the few who abstained from doing so as he had seen Aman, and desired to have his children there.<ref name=\"march\" />{{rp|62}}\n\nEventually the Eldar reached the [[Great Sea]], but on beholding it a great fear come upon them, and many withdrew into the woods and highlands of Beleriand.<ref name=\"s3\">{{S|3}}</ref> Many of the Noldor dwelt in the forests that were afterwards named [[Neldoreth]] and [[Region]]. During this time Finwë was often visited by Elwë, whose people dwelt further east; on the journey home from one such visit though, Elwë vanished, and his people sought for him in vain.<ref name=\"s4\">{{S|4}}</ref><ref>{{MR|P2g}}</ref>{{rp|§65}}\n\n[[Ulmo]], through the music of [[Ulumúri|his horns]], turned the Eldar's fear of the sea into desire, and both the Vanyar and the Noldor were then ferried over the sea on [[Tol Eressëa|an island]], eventually arriving at Aman.<ref name=\"s5\">{{S|5}}</ref>\n\n===Establishment in Aman===\nIn {{YT|1133}} the Vanyar and Noldor arrived in Aman and took possession of [[Eldamar]] where they began building the green hill of [[Túna]]; upon Túna they then raised the city [[Tirion]].<ref name=\"aa3\">{{MR|P2g}}</ref>{{rp|§67}} By {{YT|1140|n}} Tirion was full-wrought, but Ingwë and many of the Vanyar, yearning for the Light of the Trees, departed to [[Valinor]] to reside with the people of [[Manwë]].<ref name=\"aa3\" />{{rp|§68}}\n\nIn {{YT|1149|n}} Ulmo hearkened to the prayers of Finwë and went again to Middle-earth to bring Elwë and his people to Aman.<ref name=\"aa3\" />{{rp|§70}} By {{YT|1151|n}} Ulmo brought the Teleri, under Olwë their new king, within sight of Aman where at their request he fastened the island Tol Eressëa.<ref name=\"aa3\" />{{rp|§72}} Finwë grieved when the Teleri came not, and yet more when he learned that Elwë was forsaken, and knew that he should not see him again unless it were in the [[Halls of Mandos]].<ref name=\"aa3\" />{{rp|§73}}\n\nIn {{YT|1161|n}} the Teleri, drawn towards the Light of Aman, changed their hearts and came to Aman where the Noldor welcomed them with joy<ref name=\"aa3\" />{{rp|§75}} and aided them in the building of their city [[Alqualondë]].<ref name=\"aa3\" />{{rp|§76}} By {{YT|1165|n}} the last of the Vanyar departed from Tirion, and the Noldor's converse and friendship thereafter was rather with the Teleri of Aman ([[Falmari]]).<ref name=\"aa3\" />{{rp|§77}}\n\n=== Birth of Fëanor and death of Míriel ===\nIn {{YT|1169|n}} Finwë's first child, [[Fëanor]], was born to himself and Míriel.<ref>{{MR|P2k}}, Note 1, p. 101</ref> In the bearing of their son, however, Míriel was so consumed in spirit and body that nearly all her strength seemed to have passed from her. Míriel expressed this to Finwë, stating that she would never again bear child, as the strength that would have nourished many had been spent on Fëanor. Finwë grieved at this, as he desired to bring forth many children into the bliss of Aman. Finwë therefore sought the counsel of Manwë, who then delivered Míriel to the care of [[Irmo]] in [[Lórien (Valinor)|Lórien]]. Finwë was saddened by the departure of Míriel, and that she would miss the childhood days of their son. Míriel went to Lórien and laid down to sleep under a silver tree; there her [[fëa]] departed and passed in silence to the Halls of Mandos.<ref name=\"statute\">{{MR|P3II3f}}</ref>\n\nThough many Elves had previously been slain in Middle-earth, and their fëar summoned to Mandos to keep them from the Darkness, Míriel's was the first death in Aman, and it troubled the Valar greatly. Therefore, Manwë consulted directly with [[Ilúvatar]], and from Him received the authority to re-house those among the houseless who so consented.<ref>{{MR|P4q}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Phase 1: Míriel departs, hope remains -->\nYet, Finwë's grief at Míriel's passing remained great, and he often went to the gardens of Lórien to sit beside her body and call to her;<ref name=\"statute\" /> and for a while, Fëanor joined his father in vigil by his mother's body.<ref name=\"shibboleth\">{{PM|Shibboleth}}</ref> The Valar and all the Eldar, while they grieved Finwë's sorrow, were not dismayed: they believed that all things could be healed in Aman, and that once rested, her fëa and body could be reunited and returned to life.<ref name=\"shibboleth\" /> Ingwë, desiring to lift up Finwë's heart and withdraw him from vain mourning in Lórien, sent messages bidding him to leave Túna for a while, and dwell for a season in the full light of the Trees. Finwë thanked him but did not go, as he yet hoped that Míriel would return.<ref name=later_fm>{{MR|P3II4}}</ref>\n\n<!-- Phase 2: Finwë focuses on Fëanor -->\n[[File:Steamey - Finwë Mourning Míriel.jpg|thumb|right|''Finwë Mourning Míriel'' by [[:Category:Images by Steamey|Steamey]]]]\nBut Míriel was reluctant, and to all the pleas reported to her, and to the counsels of the Valar, she would say no more than \"not yet\". Each time she was approached, however, she became more determined, until at last she would listen no more and declared to leave her in peace where she was, and that she would not return.<ref name=\"shibboleth\" /> After a while Finwë went to Lórien no more, for it only increased his grief to see the fair form of Míriel that would not hear his call. All of Finwë's love was then given to his son, for Fëanor in childhood was like Míriel in voice and countenance, and Finwë was to him both father and mother, and there was a double bond of love between them.<ref name=later_fm />\n\n<!-- Phase 3: Finwë seeks healing -->\nYet Finwë, being young and eager and desiring more children, was not content. Therefore, after a few years, Finwë again spoke to Manwë of his bereavement. He exclaimed that he alone among the Eldar had no wife, and could hope for no more children save the one son, while both Ingwë and Olwë had begat many children in the bliss of Aman.<ref name=later_fm /> Finwë then asked if he must remain ever thus, for his heart warned him that Míriel would not return, and if there was not healing of ''his'' grief in Aman.<ref name=\"statute\" />\n\nManwë was moved with pity for Finwë, but the coming of death and such sorrow into Aman was of grave portent, and he thus summoned the Valar to council where they held a [[Debate of the Valar|great debate]] on the issue which resulted in the making of the [[Statute of Finwë and Míriel]]. This Statute declared that if one spouse died and refused to be reembodied, then after a set number of years the living spouse would be permitted to remarry and the deceased spouse would forever forfeit their ability to return. Manwë then called Finwë back before him and informed him of this, but noted that while Finwë would have permission to remarry if Míriel did not return, it was not counsel to do so. Finwë responded that he was in no haste, and only desired that once the doom was made clear to Míriel she would relent and set a term to his bereavement. Míriel was informed of this doom, but she maintained her desire to never return: her life had gone out into Fëanor, and she believed healing was not possible within Arda.<ref name=later_fm />\n\n<!-- Phase 4: Fëanor drifts away -->\nIn the following years, Fëanor dwelt in the care of Finwë and began to display the skills in hand and mind of both his parents. In stature he became ever more like Finwë, but in mood he resembled Míriel as his will was strong and determined;<ref name=later_fm /> also like her, he could also become wholly absorbed in his works and devices, and he thus provided little comfort to the sorrow of Finwë.<ref name=\"shibboleth\" /> \n\n<!-- Phase 5: Finwë takes back up his life -->\nBy {{YT|1182|n}}, the span of years prescribed by the Statue had passed, and the doom of disunion was spoken.<ref name=later_fm /> It thus became clear at last to Finwë that Míriel would never return within any span of time that could give him hope, and his sorrow became embittered. He sought to take up his own life again, and wandered far and wide, but in his loneliness he found no joy in anything that he did.<ref name=\"shibboleth\" />\n\n=== Remarriage to Indis ===\n[[File:Alystraea_-_Finwe_and_Indis.jpg|right|thumb|''Finwe and Indis'' by [[Alystraea]]]]\nTwo years later, in {{YT|1184|n}}, Finwë, reconsidering Ingwë's offer, thought that perhaps healing might be found in the light of [[Laurelin]] and hope in the blossom of [[Telperion]], and decided to seek Ingwë's council. \n\nOn a day, while Fëanor was abroad walking in the mountains, Finwë, travelling alone, passed through the [[Calacirian]], and towards the house of Ingwë upon the west slopes of [[Oiolossë]]. His coming was unheralded, and as he climbed the paths of the Mountain, he heard the joyous singing of [[Indis]], kinswoman of Ingwë, and he looked up and beheld her, face lit by the the golden light of Laurelin. In that moment he then knew that she loved him, and had long done so, and his heart turned to her. This, he deemed was a chance that had been granted to them both, and he declared that there was indeed healing of grief in Aman.<ref name=later_fm /> \n\nIn {{YT|1185|n}}, one year from their meeting, Finwë and Indis were wed. Finwë loved her dearly, and was glad again, and together they had four additional children: [[Findis]], [[Fingolfin]], [[Irimë]], and [[Finarfin]]. Yet, the shadow of Míriel remained in both Finwë's house, and in his heart.<ref name=later_fm /> \n\nFor Fëanor, the matter of Finwë and Indis was met with anger and resentment: by their marriage Míriel, who he loved dearly, was now condemned to never return, and he to never see or visit her again. Fëanor thus grudged the happiness of Finwë and Indis, and disliked their children before they were even born.<ref name=\"shibboleth\" /> As soon as he could, Fëanor lived apart from them: exploring the land of Aman, or busying himself with lore and crafts.<ref name=later_fm />\n\nThe estrangement between Fëanor and Indis and her children did not lessen the love between Finwë and Fëanor however; indeed, of all whom Finwë loved, Fëanor had ever the chief share of his thought.<ref name=later_fm />\n\n===Unrest of the Noldor===\n{{main|Unrest of the Noldor}}\nFor a time, the Noldor continued to dwell in Aman in happiness. The craftsmen of the Noldor worked with delight, foreseeing no end to their labours, while Fëanor became of all them, then or after, the most subtle in mind and the most skilled in hand. Finwë's sons by Indis likewise grew to their full stature.<ref name=s_feanor>{{S|Feanor}}</ref> During this happy time Finwë's house expanded greatly, with many grandchildren through the [[House of Fëanor]] (including Fëanor's unprecedented [[Sons of Fëanor|seven sons]]), the [[House of Fingolfin]], and the [[House of Finarfin]].\n\nIn {{YT|1400|n}}, after three ages of imprisonment, the [[Chaining of Melkor]] was ended and he was [[Unchaining of Melkor|granted freedom]] by Manwë.<ref name=AA4>{{MR|P2j}}</ref>{{rp|§87-88}} Though he feigned repentance, Melkor despised the Elves, and sought to estrange them from the Valar.<ref name=s_feanor /> And of the Elves, Melkor despised Fëanor most, and lusted after his great creations, the [[Silmaril]]s. Long and slow, Melkor gradually inflamed the Noldor with pride and jealousy, with visions of mighty realms to be had in Middle-earth, and of their supposed usurpation by [[Men]] who were more easily controlled by the Valar.<ref name=s_unrest>{{S|Unrest}}</ref>\n\nThough Fëanor hated and took no counsel from Melkor, in him burned most fiercely the desire for freedom and wide-realms by returning to Middle-earth. Seeing that both Fëanor and Fingolfin had grown proud and jealous of their rights and possessions, Melkor set new lies against them. To Fëanor, whispers came that Fingolfin and his sons were plotting to usurp Finwë, and the elder line of Fëanor, by leave of the Valar who were ill-pleased that Fëanor's Silmarils had not been committed to their keeping. To Fingolfin and Finarfin, however, it was said that Fëanor, having become great, bore little love for the children of Indis, and with Finwë in his hand, was making ready to drive them forth from Túna.<ref name=TSP6>{{MR|P3II6}}</ref>{{rp|§52}}\n\nWith pride and anger thus awakened, the houses of the Noldor began to quarrel and vie with one another. Melkor then spoke to them of weapons, which the Noldor secretly began to smith. In this time, Fëanor began to speak openly of rebellion against the Valar, and of delivering the Noldor from thralldom by returning to Middle-earth.<ref name=s_unrest />\n\nAmidst this unrest, Finwë grew concerned, and called a great council of all his lords. Fingolfin, arriving before the council began, spoke to Finwë and urged him to restrain Fëanor, and that if Finwë did not repent leading the Noldor to Aman, he still had at least two sons who honoured that. At this moment however, Fëanor suddenly appeared, fully armed, and rebuked Fingolfin before drawing his sword and demanding him to go. As Fingolfin left, Fëanor followed him and at the door of the king's house publicly threatened him at sword-point; as Finwë's house was in the [[Great Square]], these words were heard by many.<ref name=s_unrest />\n\n[[File:Irsanna_-_Finwe_in_Formenos.jpg|right|thumb|''Finwe in Formenos'' by [[Irsanna]]]]\nWroth at these deeds, Manwë summoned Fëanor, along with all others who had any part in the unrest, to the [[Ring of Doom]] to stand before Mandos. After all testimony had been given, Melkor's role became apparent, and [[Tulkas]] was sent to retrieve him. Fëanor was not held guiltless though, and he was banished from Túna for twelve years. Fëanor thus departed to [[Formenos]] where he was joined by [[Sons of Fëanor|his sons]] as well as by Finwë, who would not be parted from him.<ref name=s_unrest /> The rule of the Noldor who remained in Tirion was then committed to Fingolfin by Manwë.<ref name=\"MR22\">{{MR|P3II3e}}, note 22</ref>\n\nAfter two years Melkor, who had hidden himself, came secretly to Formenos, disguised as a traveller seeking lodging, and spoke with Fëanor before his door. Melkor feigned friendship and urged Fëanor to his former thoughts of flight, but then overreached when he spoke of the Silmarils, causing Fëanor to turn him away and shut the door in his face. Finwë was filled with great dread on learning of this, and in haste sent messengers to Manwë.<ref name=TSP6/>{{rp|§54}}\n\n===Death and aftermath===\nSeeking to heal the griefs between the lords of the Noldor, Manwë prepared a [[High_feast#High_feast_of_1495|great high feast]] for all to join. To Formenos he sent a messenger specifically bidding the attendance of Fëanor, which Fëanor interpreted as a command, and thus he went.<ref>{{MR|P3II7}}</ref>{{rp|§58c}} Along with the sons of Fëanor, Finwë refused the invitation, saying that \"while the ban lasts upon Fëanor my son, that he may not go to Túna, I hold myself unkinged, and will not meet my people, nor those that rule in my stead\".<ref>{{MR|P2j}}</ref>{{rp|§112}}\n\nAfter the departure of Fëanor, Finwë was heavy with grief, and a foreboding was upon him. Soon, Melkor, along with [[Ungoliant]], assaulted Formenos, enveloping it as a black cloud. While all others fled, Finwë remained and stood alone defiant against them, and was slain; his head was crushed though with a great mace of iron, his body burned and destroyed, and his sword twisted and untempered as if by lightning-stroke.<ref>{{MR|P3II8}}</ref>{{rp|§§9-10}}<ref group=note>Christopher Tolkien notes that the two accounts of Finwë's death \"may not be death altogether contradictory, for in the present text Maedros speaks of seeing a sudden flame out of the Cloud of Ungoliantë, followed by ‘one piercing cry’, and of finding Finwë’s sword ‘twisted and untempered as if by lightning-stroke’.\" - {{MR|P3II9a}}, commentary, §10</ref>\n\nIn the subsequent [[flight of the Noldor]], the slaying of Finwë was a key motivator in their decision to depart from Aman. During [[Speech of Fëanor|Fëanor's speech]] he declared that he ''\"would not dwell longer in the same land with the kin of my father’s slayer\"'',<ref>{{MR|Speech}}</ref>{{rp|§132}} while Fingolfin, prior to Fëanor's theft of the ships, stated that he had ''\"an errand in Middle-earth, the avenging of the blood of my father upon Morgoth, whom the Valar let loose among us.\"''<ref>{{PM|XINotes}}</ref>{{rp|33}}\n\nIn the unhappy events which latter came to pass, many judged that if Finwë had endured the loss of Míriel and been content with the fathering of his mighty son Fëanor, then Fëanor's courses would have been different, and much sorrow and evil would not have been.<ref name=later_fm/>{{rp|§28}}\n\n===Forfeiture of return===\nAfter Finwë's death, his fëa departed to Mandos where he met again with Míriel. Míriel was glad of the meeting, but moved to sadness once she learned all that had transpired since her departure. She accepted that she erred in leaving Finwë and Fëanor, or at least in not returning soon after a brief repose, and bore no grudge against Indis for cherishing what she had abandoned. Míriel then expressed a desire to return to her body, and record the deeds of their people, including Finwë and his children, into tapestry.<ref name=\"p3ii3d\">{{MR|P3II3d}}, pp. 248-9</ref>\n\nFinwë then went to [[Vairë]] and requested Míriel be returned to life, offering instead for he himself to forever remain in Mandos in her place. When Vairë remarked that Finwë seemed to now be considering Míriel only, and to have forgotten about Indis and his children with her, Finwë retorted that was unjust; he was able to love two women without the love for one diminishing the love for the other. Additionally, he stated that he had been apart from Indis for many years, that her love was now mostly for Fingolfin, and that most of all she longed to return to the peace of the Vanyar and be away from the strife of the Noldor.<ref name=\"p3ii3d\" />\n\nWhen Mandos was approached he declared Finwë making this offer of his own free will a counsel of healing, and consented to Míriel's return with Finwë's abnegation as her ransom. On waking, Míriel entered the House of Vairë and became her chief handmaid, and there recorded all tidings of the Noldor into great tapestries. Of these Finwë was at times permitted to look upon.<ref name=\"p3ii3d\" />\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Quentandil - Finwe device.png|right|thumb|''Finwe device'' by [[User:Quentandil|Quentandil]]]]\nFinwë had black hair and brilliant grey-blue eyes.<ref>{{PM|XINotes}}</ref>{{rp|19}}\n\nIn his youth, before becoming King of the Noldor, Finwë was gallant and adventurous, but also rebellious and independent. Before serving as an ambassador, he had \"heretical\" leanings and was much taken by the lies of Melkor that the Valar had, rightly, previously abandoned Endor as the appointed realm of the Quendi, but became jealous and sought to re-posses it and to control the Quendi as their vassals. Once he arrived in Valinor, however, he was dazzled and overawed, and thus became the most converted and ardent for accepting the invitation of the Valar to dwell there.<ref name=\"keydates\" />\n\nHe became known as the \"wisest of all the children of the world\".<ref name=\"mrcoming\">{{MR|P3I3}}</ref>{{rp|§26}}\n\nWhen Indis's heart had turned towards Finwë, in the days when the Vanyar still dwelt at Tirion, \"he seemed to her fairest and noblest of the Eldar, dark-haired and white of brow, eager of face but with eyes full of thought; and his voice and mastery of words delighted her.\"<ref name=later_fm/>{{rp|§24}}\n\n==Etymology==\n'''Finwë''', is one of the oldest recorded names of the Eldar, and it is not certain that it had any meaning beyond the stem ''\"fin-\"'' followed by the suffix ''\"[[-wë]]\"''.<ref name=\"finwe\">{{PM|Finwe}}</ref>{{rp|419}}\n\nThe second element was explained by [[loremaster]]s as an old word for 'person', derived from the stem <code>√EWE</code>, but survived in Quenya only as a final element in names. The first element (fin-) was often later explained as related to [[Common Eldarin]] <code>√PHIN</code> (\"hair\"), as in [[Quenya]] ''finë'' (\"a hair\"), ''findë'' (\"hair\", especially of the head), ''finda'' (\"having hair\", \"-haired\"), but it was doubtful. All the Eldar had beautiful hair, but the Noldor were not specially remarkable in this respect, and there is no reference to Finwë as having had hair of exceptional length, abundance, or beauty beyond the measure of his people.<ref name=\"finwe\" />{{rp|419}} \n\nAlternatively, <code>√PHIN</code> has the meaning of [(\"clever\", \"fine\", \"delicate\"), (\"nimbleness\", \"skill\"), or (\"skilful\", \"neat\", \"clever\")].<ref name=\"pe17\">{{PE|17}}</ref>{{rp|181}} With this interpretation, Finwë is defined as \"man of manual skill\".<ref name=\"pe17\" />{{rp|17}} \n\n\"fin\" having meanings of both \"skill\" and \"hair\" may be explained by <code>√SPIN</code> [(\"fine thread\", \"filament\") or (\"a single hair\")], being distinct, though probably ultimately connected, from <code>√PHIN</code>, and eventually itself becoming \"phin-\" in Quenya.<ref name=\"pe17\" />{{rp|17}}\n\nIn the [[Qenya Lexicon]] (QL) the root <code>FINI</code> is used in ''finwa'' (\"acute\", \"sagacious\"); ''finië'' and ''findë'' (\"cunning\"); and ''fint'' (\"a trick\", \"notion\"). These are provided to be compared with \"Finwë\".<ref name=\"pe12\">{{PE|12}}</ref>{{rp|38}}\n\nBeing king of the Noldor, Finwë was styled as '''''Ñoldóran''''',<ref name=\"Descendants\"/> which is a compound of ''[[noldo|Ñoldo]]'' and ''[[aran]]'' 'king', where ''o''+''a'' assimilated into a long ''ó''.<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3561596031.html|articlename=Q.

He was one of the [[Eru-begotten|first awakened Elves]], and when [[Nornorë]], herald of the Valar, bid for a few of them to come to Valinor, Finwë was one of the three who came forward. In Valinor, the three Elves were \"utterly dazed and astonied\" by the splendor of the lights of the Two Trees, and bowed in reverence. When Manwë then asked of them from where they came to the world, and what desires it filled them with, Nólemë responded \"Lo! Most mighty one, whence indeed come we! For meseems I awoke but now from a sleep eternally profound, whose vast dreams already are forgotten\". He then returns to his people and leads them to Valinor, on the second ferrying of the island after the Teleri (Vanyar) took the first.<ref>{{LT1|V}}</ref>\n\nWhen Melko began to sow discord among the Gnomes, Nólemë spoke against him in efforts to calm their restlessnes and discontents. Eventually he took council with Fëanor (a great craftsman, not his son), Inwë (Ingwë), and Ellu Melemno (Olwë) and decided to send an embassy to Manwë on the matter; when his embassy arrived however, Melko was already there, having spoken to Manwë and giving a false account before they arrived. Manwë chided both parties: to Melko he bid to dwell in penitence in Mandos; and to the Gnomes, \"fearing lest the pollution of their discontent spread among the other kindreds\", he banished from their city of [[Kôr]] to new dwellings further away. Following this, Melko first used the [[Feast of Double Mirth]] as an opportunity to steal the [[Silmarils]], murdering Fëanor's father Bruithwir in the process, and then, with Gloomweaver (Ungoliant), slew the Two Trees.<ref>{{LT1|VI}}</ref>\n\nAfter the darkening of Valinor, Fëanor was able to rally the Gnomes to follow him in departing. Nólemë spoke against this rashness and, when his people wouldn't hear him, he pleaded to at least send an embassy to Manwë for due farewell and perhaps receive goodwill and council; even this \"moderate wisdom\", however, Fëanor turned the Gnomes against. Even though he was unable to persuade his people through council, Nólemë would not be separated from them, and aided them in all their preparations. The Noldoli then departed Kôr, stole ships from the [[Solosimpi]] (Falmari), and crossed the [[Helcaraxë|frozen wastes in the north]] to reach the Great Lands.<ref>{{LT1|VII}}</ref>\n\nIn earlier outlines of ''The History of the Exiled Gnomes'' the Noldoli then encamped at the [[Waters of Asgon]] (Lake Mithrim), and Nólemë (now also known as ''Fingolma'') begot his son '''Turundo''' (''Turgon'' in Gnomish), who was was born to 'prophecies'. In one version, Nólemë perished when his small boat vanished down a hidden-way as he was sailing to an islanded rock in Asgon to offer sacrifice (it is not said to whom he was sacrificing). In an emended version, Nólemë's host left Asgon, fought with the Orcs, and then encamped at [[Sirion]] where they met the [[Ilkorins]]. When the hosts of Melko approached, the Noldoli retreated to Gorfalon (Valley of the Fountains) where they made the acquaintance of Men and, after sending embassies to [[Túvo]], [[Tinwelint]] (Thingol), and [[Ermon]], Fingolma marshalled a great host. Melko, however, beguiled many of the Men, and they abandoned or betrayed the Elves, resulting in \"the terrible [[Battle of Unnumbered Tears]]\". While Nólemë's fate is not explicitly stated, it's implied he was slain as his son Turgon escaped and quarrelled with the Sons of Fëanor for leadership.<ref name=lt1x>{{LT1|X}}</ref>\n\nIn later outlines of ''The History of the Exiled Gnomes'' the Noldoli bested the Orcs in their first battle with them, capturing the pass of the [[Bitter Hills]], and escaping from the [[Land of Shadows]]. They entered the Forest of Artanor (Doriath) and the  Region of the Great Plains and Nólemë's host grew to a vast size. Their chief camp was about Sirion and they drove the Orcs into the foothills of the Iron Mountains. Melko suborned many Men and, in the ensuing Battle of Unnumbered Tears, Nólemë was isolated, slain, and the Orcs cut out his heart; Turgon however rescued Nólemë's body and recaptured his heart. When the Sons of Fëanor eventually arrived they found a stricken field; they buried the body of Nólemë and erected the greatest cairn in the world over it, called by the Gnomes the [[Hill of Death]].<ref name=lt1x /> Turgon later took his heart, encased it in gold, and took it [[Scarlet Heart|for his emblem]]<ref>{{LT1|Xn}}</ref>{{rp|note 11}}\n\nPrior to his death Fingolma, as well as the Sons of Fëanor, favoured Eöl because he was the leader of the Miners and searched after hidden jewels; Eöl loved from afar Fingolma's daughter Isfin, though she in return loathed him.<ref>{{LT2|IIIn}}</ref>\n\n===Later versions===\nIn the ''[[Prose Fragments Following the Lost Tales]]'', '''Gelmir''' is the King of the Gnomes.
