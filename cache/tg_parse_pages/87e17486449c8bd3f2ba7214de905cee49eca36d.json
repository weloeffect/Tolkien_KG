My friends, very justly, said after seeing them that they had reduced the text to a commentary on the pictures.<br/><br/>I have now seen and returned the ‘paste-up’; and though I am glad that so many of the illustrations have been preserved, at least in the sense that they are represented, I  am distressed. Ignorant as I am of the costs and of production-processes, I had hoped for a larger page and space. I fear it has done small justice to your beautiful line and pattern to reduce the size so drastically.<br/><br/>Even so, what little value this rather slender ‘squib’ has is much enhanced by your work.<br/><br/>I am hoping soon to get some larger works published, and in a more ample fashion; and if so, I hope you might be interested, or at least have time to consider them. One, a long romance in sequel to ''[[The Hobbit]]'', is finished after some years of work, and is being typed. It is held up at the moment, since I am immersed in examinations and other weary business; but when it's done, I wonder if I could prevail on you to glance at it.<br/><br/>I hope that we may perhaps [have the?] opportunity of meeting ere [?]<br/><br/>Yours sincerely,<br/><br/>J.R.R. Tolkien}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n*[http://arts.independent.co.uk/books/features/article2714838.ece ''The greatest letters ever written'']\n*[http://www.sothebys.com/app/live/lot/LotDetail.jsp?lot_id=34NDN Item description on the web site of Sotheby's]\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Letters|Baynes, Pauline]]\n[[Category:Letters to Pauline Baynes]]\n{{title}}"}}}
