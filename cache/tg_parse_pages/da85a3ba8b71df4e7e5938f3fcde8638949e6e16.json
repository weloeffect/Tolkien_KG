Untouched by the dragon were magical golden harps as well as chainmail and weapons that hung from the walls.<ref name=\"Home\"/>  However, when first seen by Bilbo, the main feature of the hall was the hoard of treasure that Smaug had accumulated.<ref name=\"Inside\"/>\n\n==History==\nIn {{TA|1999}} [[Thráin I]] came to Erebor and established the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]].<ref name=\"TA\">{{App|TA}}</ref>  Either then or soon thereafter  the [[Arkenstone]] was discovered under the roots of the Mountain<ref name=\"Inside\"/> and was kept in the newly made Great Hall (which was named after the kingdom's founder).  The gemstone was removed when [[Thorin I]] departed for the [[Grey Mountains]] in {{TA|2210|n}}, but was brought back in {{TA|2590}} when Thrór returned to Erebor, and the Arkenstone was again stored in the Great Hall.<ref name=\"TA\"/>\n\nIn {{TA|2770|n}} Smaug descended upon the Mountain,<ref name=\"TA\"/> killing or routing all of the Dwarves.  He took the Great Hall as his abode and piled all of his plunder in it for his bed.<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|2941|n}}<ref name=\"TA\"/> Bilbo Baggins was the first person to visit the Great Hall of Thráin after the invasion of Smaug.  On his first visit the dragon was asleep and the hobbit made off with a golden cup.  On his second visit he conversed with Smaug and discovered the Worm's weak spot.<ref name=\"Inside\"/>  On his third visit, with the Dwarves, the company explored the Hall and escaped from the Mountain.<ref name=\"Home\"/>  After the host of Elves and Men from [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]] arrived the Dwarves passed their time in the Great Hall piling and ordering the treasure, while Thorin searched for the Arkenstone.<ref>{{H|Thief}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Battle of Five Armies]] the Arkenstone was not kept in the Great Hall; instead it was placed on Thorin's tomb, alongside Orcrist; where it is said that the sword gleamed in the dark at the approach of foes, preventing the Dwarf-realm from ever being taken unawares.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>\n\n{{references|note}}\n{{companyroute}}\n[[Category:Buildings]]\n[[Category:Rhovanion]]\n[[fi:Thráinin Suuri Sali]]"}}}
