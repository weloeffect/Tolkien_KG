They thus named the river the ''Gwath-hîr'' (\"River of Shadow\") in [[Sindarin]], which became ''Gwathir''. However, later when the Númenóreans explored the river further northeastward they reached the beginning of the great fens, the ''Nîn-in-Eilph'' (\"[[Swanfleet]]\"). Mistakenly believing that the fens were the source of the river, they changed the name of the river to ''Gwathló'', where the ''lô'' meant \"fenland\", and thus the new name meant the \"shadowy river from the fens\".<ref name=\"FifthParagraph\" /> This name was translated into [[Adûnaic]] as ''Agathurush''.<ref name=\"SixthParagraph\">{{UT|6d}}, discussion of the name ''Gwathló'', sixth paragraph</ref>\n\nBefore the year {{SA|800}}, Aldarion built the haven [[Vinyalondë]] – which means \"New Haven\" in [[Quenya]] – at the mouth of the river Gwathló as a point where he could obtain timber and repair his ships in [[Middle-earth]], because his father had decreed a curb on the felling of trees in [[Númenor]] for the purpose of shipbuilding.<ref name=\"Wife\" /> Later in the Second Age this haven would be called ''[[Lond Daer]]'' or ''Lond Daer Enedh'', the Great Middle Heaven, because it was then located between [[Lindon]] in the north and [[Pelargir]] in the south.<ref name=\"Author\" />\n\nAfter he took the sceptre of the kingdom of Númenor in {{SA|883}},<ref>{{UT|4a}}, ''Chronology'', second paragraph</ref> Aldarion traveled up the River Gwathló as far as [[Tharbad]] and met [[Galadriel]] there.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}, ''The Further Course of the Narrative'', fourth paragraph</ref> It is not known if Tharbad was just a ford or if somebody had already settled at Tharbad at the time of their meeting.\n\nBefore {{SA|1695}},<ref name=\"FourthParagraph\">{{UT|6d}}, discussion of the name ''Gwathló'', fourth paragraph</ref> the Númenóreans had devastated the forests below Tharbad by felling trees to obtain timber to build ships. The local population who had lived in those forests had initially been in awe of the Númenóreans, but had become hostile to them and attacked and ambushed them when the felling of trees became devastating. In return, the Númenóreans treated their attackers as enemies.<ref name=\"ThirdParagraph\">{{UT|6d}}, discussion of the name ''Gwathló'', third paragraph</ref> It is possible that the Númenóreans built the forts at the haven of Lond Daer and along the banks of the river Gwathló because of those conflicts with the native population. The surviving native population fled from [[Enedwaith]] to the Misty Mountains in the east and from Minhiriath to the dark woods of the cape of [[Eryn Vorn]]<ref name=\"ThirdParagraph\" />.\n\nAfter the invasion of [[Eriador]] by [[Sauron]], the exiled native population who had previously lived in the forests along the Gwathló welcomed Sauron and hoped that he would defeat the Númenóreans. Sauron knew that the haven of Lond Daer and its shipyards were important to the Númenóreans. As a consequence, he used the exiled natives as spies and guides for his raiding parties who started fires in the woods and burned the great wood-stores of the Númenóreans.<ref name=\"FourthParagraph\" />\n\nDuring the war in Eriador, Sauron did not have enough troops to spare for assaults on the forts of the Númenóreans at the haven of Vinyalondë and along the banks of the river Gwathló.<ref name=\"FourthParagraph\" /> By {{SA|1700}}, Sauron had destroyed the elven realm of Eregion and conquered all of Eriador except [[Rivendell]], where he had left strong forces to prevent Elrond to attack him in the rear and had reached the river [[Lhûn]], which was defended by the Elves of the realm of [[Lindon]] and by Númenórean forces that had been stationed in Lindon. Additional forces of Sauron approached from the south-east and were in Enedwaith at the crossing of Tharbad, which was only lightly held.<ref name=\"GC\">{{UT|Concerning}}</ref> It is not known if there were Númenórean forts at the crossing of Tharbad or if the crossing of Tharbad was lightly held by the Númenóreans or by forces of Sauron.\n\nAfter a great fleet commanded by the Númenórean admiral [[Ciryatur]] landed with troops from Númenór in {{SA|1700}}, the forces of Sauron were defeated and driven back to the south-east to the river [[Baranduin]]. After another defeat at the [[Sarn Ford]], they were driven back further to the south-east to the river Gwathló where the forces of Sauron were reinforced by his force at Tharbad. However, Ciryatur had sent a part of his fleet to the haven of Lond Daer and landed a strong Númenórean force there that attacked the forces of Sauron in his rear in the [[Battle of the Gwathló]].<ref name=\"GC\" /> It is not known if the forces of Sauron that had approached from the south-east were still on the southern bank of the river Gwathló in Enedwaith at Tharbad or if the forces had already crossed to the northern side of the river. It is also not known if the forces of Sauron that retreated from Sarn Ford had already crossed the river to its southern side at Tharbad and where at the Gwathló the Battle of the Gwathló took place.
