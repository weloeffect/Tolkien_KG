The name may have been inspired by that of a thirteenth-century manuscript called ''Fagrskinna'', meaning \"fine vellum\" in Old Norse. (''Fagrskinna'' was destroyed by fire in the eighteenth century, but not before a copy was made.)\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn the second version of [[Appendix F]], the official name of the book popularly called ''Yellowskin'' was ''The Great Writ of Tuckborough'' and it was supposed to be nearly a thousand years old.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, p. 40</ref>\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Books and documents within the legendarium]]\n[[de:Gelbhülle]]\n[[fr:encyclo/arts/livres/peaujaune]]\n[[fi:Keltanahkainen]]"}}}
