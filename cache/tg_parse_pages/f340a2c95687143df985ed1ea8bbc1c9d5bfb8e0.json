The original idea for MCME came from that post. The project was founded by a group of players in 2010, who dreamed of re-creating Middle-earth in Minecraft. Their objective is to build the whole of Middle-earth as a community all while remaining as accessible as possible. Therefore MCME does not use any [https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Mods mods]. Another important consideration early on, was the time at which the server should be set, after deliberation by the community, it was decided to set it to 22 September, [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|Bilbo’s 111th birthday]] [[Third Age|T.A.]] [[Third Age 3001|3001]]. \n\nGiven its popularity and shallow learning curve, Minecraft was a good medium in which to work. In the server’s early days, players had to apply in order to join the server, as there were no tools that protected builds. The project started on a vanilla world and players had to flatten and build all of the terrain by hand. Along with the multiplayer Minecraft community, MCME evolved to include world protection and terrain editing plugins. However, given the limitations of the game, it was hard to create realistic builds. MCME’s commitment to accessibility meant that there were certain limitations that they could not overcome by modding game files. While MCME used [https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Resource_pack resource packs] (RP) from the beginning, changing textures in order to more closely resemble the aesthetic needed, this would not allow for new blocks to be added to the game. Clever workarounds, like splitting the map into different RP regions and using different [https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Block_states block states], had to be developed, making the server infrastructure behind the build project an impressive project in itself.

The server has a very experienced group of build staff members who set up jobs where everyone can help, plots that are assigned or claimed individually or with friends, and build events like build days, where the whole community comes together to work on one area. Builds are inspired by various interpretations such as the movies and real life information and architecture, but always refer back to the books wherever possible. Other details are added to the world to help explorers feel more immersed. For instance, the project has its own soundtrack, composed by volunteers. Additionally there are tours and minigames each week and many community driven events during the year.  \n\nAs of 2024, MCME has been presented at the [[Deutsche Tolkien Gesellschaft e.V.|German Tolkien Society's]] Tolkien Days Convention three times.\n\n==Progress==\nRegions and locations which have been completed as of May 2025 include, [[Minas Tirith]], [[The Shire]], [[Rivendell]], [[Rohan]], [[Lothlórien]], [[Isengard]], [[Dol Amroth]], [[Pelargir]], [[Osgiliath]], [[Paths of the Dead]] and [[Lond Daer|Lond Daer Enedh]].
