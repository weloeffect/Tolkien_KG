It was extremely long, thus its name.  \n\nIn the late [[Third Age]], it was presumed to have been lost or destroyed, and even some [[Dwarves]] thought that it was legendary. [[Gandalf]] proved it not so when he pursued [[Durin's Bane]] up it to the peak, but during the [[Battle of the Peak|combat]] the tower fell and the entry to the stairs was destroyed.<ref>{{TT|III5}}, p. 502</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===The Endless Stair in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nThe Lord of the Rings Online - Endless Stair.jpg|thumb|The Endless Stair in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n'''2008: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Endless Stair can be observed from many locations within [[Moria]], creating an appearance of various altitude levels on the geometrically flat game environment. Players can access the bottom of the Stair in the Foundations of Stone and climb several flights, only to find the further passage blocked by the destruction left in the Balrog's wake.\n\n{{references}}\n{{LegendLoc}}\n[[Category:Buildings]]\n[[Category:Moria]]\n[[de:Endlose Treppe]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/routes/escalier sans fin]]\n[[fi:Päättymättömät portaat]]"}}}
