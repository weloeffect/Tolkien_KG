However, other than the appearance of the root ''dwimor-'' in the abovementioned names, there is no indication in Tolkien's writings that the word pre-existed or that it was used for other races.<ref>http://tolkien.slimy.com/essays/DayBooks.html</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dwimordene]]\n*[[Dwimorberg]]\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Epithets]]\n[[Category:Nazgûl]]\n[[Category:Old English names]]\n[[Category:Undead]]\n[[fi:Noitakuningas#Muita nimiä]]"}}}
