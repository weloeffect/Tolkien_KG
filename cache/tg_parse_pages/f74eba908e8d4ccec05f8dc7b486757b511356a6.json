However, Tolkien once stated in a letter to James Heaf on [[28 February]] in [[1964]] that he did \"not think it was an [[Entwives|Entwife]] which Hal saw on the North Moors\" and suggested the possibility that the Tree-man may have been \"a [[Trolls|troll]]\" of some kind.<ref name=\"unpublished\">[https://www.tolkienguide.com/guide/letters/544?q=tag%3AEntwives TCG Letter #544] on the Tolkien Collector Guide</ref> While trolls were never said to be capable of \"walking seven yards to a stride\", it is possible that some details of the sighting may have been exaggerated by Halfast.\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Regions of the Shire]]\n[[de:Nordmoore]]\n[[fi:Pohjannummet]]"}}}
