However, [[Morgoth|Melkor]] claimed Arda for himself alone, and there were the [[First War]] that ravaged until the coming of [[Tulkas]] whose prowess urged Melkor to retreat.\n\n[[File:Steven White Jr. - Early Arda.jpg|250px|thumb|left|''Early Arda'' by [[:Category:Images by Steven White Jr.|Steven White Jr.]]]]\n\nWhen the Valar finally repaired damage made by Melkor, they chose the initial shape of Arda; it was of a symmetrical continent lit by the [[Two Lamps]]: one in the continent's north, and one in the south, made out of the misty light that veiled the barren ground. The Valar concentrated this light into two colossal vessels, [[Illuin]] and [[Ormal]]. Then [[Aulë|Aulë the Smith]] forged great towers, one in the north, [[Helcar]], and another in the south, [[Ringil (tower)|Ringil]]. In the middle, where the light of the Lamps mingled, the Valar dwelt at the island of [[Almaren]], their first kingdom. Thus the [[Spring of Arda]] flourished upon the Earth.\n\n[[File:John Howe - The Making of Middle-earth.jpg|250px|thumb|''The Making of Middle-earth'' by [[John Howe]]]]\n\nThe Two Lamps shone until they were destroyed by an assault of Melkor. Arda was again darkened, and the Lamps' fall spoiled the perfect symmetry of Arda's surface, and thus the Spring came to an end. Separate continents appeared: [[Aman]] in the far West, [[Middle-earth]], or ''Endor'', in the centre from the north to south, and the [[Land of the Sun]] in the far East. At the site of the northern Lamp the inland [[Sea of Helcar]] later formed, of which [[Cuiviénen]] was a bay. After that the reckoning of the [[Years of the Trees]] started, when [[Yavanna]] grew the Two Trees in [[Valinor]]. However, Middle-earth was still covered in [[The Darkness|darkness]] and Melkor dominated it residing in his dreadful stronghold [[Utumno]].<ref>{{S|Days}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn [[J.R.R. Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien's]] latest writings in which Arda was a [[Round World version of the Silmarillion|round world]] from its beginning, the Sun and Moon (and the Two Trees for a time) had always given light to Arda, and the Two Lamps never existed.<ref>{{MR|Myths}}, p. 375 - 385</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\nIn [[David Day]]'s books the period was [[fanon]]ically misnamed \"Ages/Years of the Lamps\".<ref>[[David Day]], ''[[Tolkien: The Illustrated Encyclopedia]]'', section \"History\", pp. 14-15</ref> However, J.R.R.
