It was the theme song for the [[1977]] [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|film adaptation]] of ''[[The Hobbit]]''. The full song plays during the night before the group's departure from the Shire, and excerpts reprise throughout the story.\n\n==Lyrics==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nThe greatest adventure is what lies ahead.\nToday and tomorrow are yet to be said.\nThe chances, the changes are all yours to make.\nThe mold of your life is in your hands to break.\n\nThe greatest adventure is there if you're bold.\nLet go of the moment that life makes you hold.\nTo measure the meaning can make you delay;\nIt's time you stop thinkin' and wasting the day.\n\nThe man who's a dreamer and never takes leave\nWho thinks of a world that is just make-believe\nWill never know passion, will never know pain.\nWho sits by the window will one day see rain.\n\nThe greatest adventure is what lies ahead.\nToday and tomorrow are yet to be said.\nThe chances, the changes are all yours to make.\nThe mold of your life is in your hands to break.\n\nThe greatest adventure is what lies ahead.\n</poem>\n\n== Music Video ==\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-_r1Npsv5I The Hobbit - the greatest adventure (YouTube)]\n[[Category:The Hobbit (1977 film) soundtrack]]"}}}
