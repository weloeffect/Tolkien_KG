Mainly known for his work on the Popeye and Tom and Jerry series, he was the director and creator of the [[The Hobbit (1967 film)|first animated film]] of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' in 1967. The film was produced by William Snyder and was made in under a month. The running time for the film was a minuscule 12 minutes and was produced simply so Snyder could extend his license for ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and sell it back to [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] and his publishers for $100,000.\n\n== External links ==\n* '''[http://www.genedeitch.com/ Official Website]'''\n* {{WP|Gene Deitch}}\n* [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0215126/ Gene Deitch] at IMDb\n* [http://genedeitch.awn.com/index.php3?ltype=chapter&chapter=22 \"Hobbit-alized\" by Gene Deitch] - An explanation of the circumstances behind the 12-minute film\n\n[[Category:Directors|Deitch, Gene]]\n[[Category:American people|Deitch, Gene]]\n[[Category:People by name|Deitch, Gene]]"}}}
