Figwit was invented by [[Warner Bros.]] for [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]], where he was portrayed by [[Bret McKenzie]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring - Figwit.jpg|left|thumb|Figwit's appearance at the Council of Elrond in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]\nFigwit is first seen during the [[Council of Elrond]] where he is sitting next to [[Aragorn]] before the Council begins to argue. After Frodo shouts \"I will take it\" and everyone turns to look at him, Figwit appears in the background to the far right for only just a fraction of a second.\n\nFigwit appears again when [[Arwen]] is leaving with a [[Wandering Companies|wandering company]] of [[Elves]] for the [[Grey Havens]] and has a [[Arwen's Vision|vision]] about her future son [[Eldarion]]. Figwit beckons Arwen to return to the other Elves. His exact words are \"Lady Arwen, we cannot delay\" and \"My lady\".\n\n==Fandom==\nFigwit's rise to fame began shortly after the first movie, and some fans believe that he was given dialog in the third movie because [[Peter Jackson]] was aware of the attention given to this extra. Jackson mentions the phenomenon in the commentary track on the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (extended edition)|extended edition of the ''Return of the King'']]: <blockquote>''The decision to give him a speaking role was developed after the scene was scripted. Originally just a random cast extra was to give the lines, but it was decided that it would be fun if the Figwit actor was brought in to deliver them.''</blockquote>\n\n===Figwit's \"brother\"===\nFigwit has a lesser known \"brother\", played by extra Blair Morton. '''Meorof''', also known as the \"Mystery Elf On (The) Right Of Figwit\", appears at the [[Council of Elrond]] sitting in the seat on Figwit's right<ref> {{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.theargonath.cc/characters/meorof/meorof.html|articlename=Meorof|dated=|website=[https://www.theargonath.cc/ www.argonath.cc]|accessed=28 August 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name '''Figwit''' is a humorous acronym created by fans which stands for \"[[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] is grea...who is THAT?!?\"<ref name=\"website\">{{webcite|author=inDUHvidual and Arwenelf|articleurl=http://www.figwitlives.net/faq.htm#|articlename=FigwitLives' FAQ|dated=|website=[http://www.figwitlives.net/ www.figwitlives.net]|accessed=23 August 2005}}</ref>\n\n==Other names==\nFigwit is credited in the credits of ''[[The Return of the King]]'' under the name '''Elf Escort''', and his [[Decipher Card]] gives the name '''[[Aegnor]]''', a name derived from ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.<ref name=\"website\" />\n\nIn [[Fanfiction|fan fiction]], Figwit is sometimes called '''Melpomaen''', a shoddy translation of the elements \"fig\" (''melpo'' in [[Qenya]]) and \"wit\" (''maen'' in [[Noldorin]]).<ref name=\"website\" />\n\nBret McKenzie's character in ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'' is '''[[Lindir]]''', who shares similarities with Figwit. Both are dark-haired Elves of [[Rivendell]] and courtiers of [[Elrond]]. It is unclear if the two characters are intended to be the same, which would establish a film \"canon\" name for Figwit.\n\n==Other media==\nIn 2004, a 50-minute documentary on the Figwit phenomenon, [http://www.enzedff.co.nz/filmsynopsis.asp?FilmID=1802&Archive=0&RegionID=1&EventID=8 ''\"Frodo is great... Who is that?!!\"''], was made by three [[Wellington]] filmmakers - Stan Alley, Nick Booth, and Hannah Clarke - all of whom worked on Peter Jackson's ''The Lord of the Rings'' adaptation. The documentary follows Bret McKenzie to Edinburgh where he meets the fans of his trademark pout and \"elvish good looks\" and features extensive interviews with fans behind various Figwit fan sites as well as [[Peter Jackson]], [[Barry Osbourne]], [[Mark Ordesky]], [[Ian McKellen]], and a pre-fame [[Taika Waititi]].\n\nFigwit has also appeared in official merchandise of the movie franchise: once on an autograph card, and once on a card for [[Arwen]]. Both of these cards are made by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topps Topps].<ref name=\"website\" />\n\n==See also==\n*'''[[Lindir]]''', a character from ''[[The Hobbit]]'' also portrayed by [[Bret McKenzie]] for [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' films]].\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Elves from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings (film series) characters]]\n\n[[de:Figwit]]"}}}
