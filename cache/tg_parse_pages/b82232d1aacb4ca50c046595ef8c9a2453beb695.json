The Glittering Caves extended deep under the mountains, with many passages, stairs, halls, and chambers. The floors were sandy and the ceilings were high, domed vaults. The walls were polished stone set with gems and crystals and veins of ore.<ref>{{TT|Road}}, pp. 547-8</ref>\n\nThe entrance to the caves was behind the [[Deeping Wall]] in a narrow gorge that could be defended long against an onslaught, making them an ideal refuge location.\n\n[[Gimli]] called the Glittering Caves one of the marvels of the Northern World, and his description of them to [[Legolas]] was reportedly one of the few times that a dwarf has bested an elf with words; Legolas was left speechless after visiting them. \n\n==History==\nThe [[Númenóreans]] built the fortress of Aglarond during the [[Second Age]].<ref>{{S|V}}, p. 291</ref> The meaning of the Sindarin name of the fortress suggests that they already knew of the existence of the caves. Later, after the founding of [[Rohan]] it was used as a storage space and refuge for [[Rohirrim]] who used the [[Hornburg]].\n\n===War of the Ring===\nDuring the [[Battle of the Hornburg]] on [[3 March|3]]-[[4 March]], {{TA|3019}}, many of the women, children, and elderly people of the [[Westfold]] took refuge in the Glittering Caves. Livestock and food were stored there as well. \n\nSome [[Orcs]] crept through a culvert in the Deeping Wall and entered the gorge but were killed or driven back by the defenders. Then the Deeping Wall was breached by an explosive device and the Enemy forces entered the Deep. Many of the [[Rohirrim]] including [[Éomer]] were driven back to the Glittering Caves, and with them was Gimli.<ref>{{TT|Deep}}, pp. 535-8</ref>\n\nAfter the war Gimli brought [[Legolas]] to see the caves; the Elf was so impressed that he was silent and said that only Gimli could fittingly describe them.<ref>{{RK|Partings}}, p. 978</ref>\n\n===As a Dwarven colony===\nWhen [[Gimli|Gimli Elf-friend]] was held up in the caves, he was amazed by their beauty. After the [[War of the Ring]] he brought from [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] part of [[Durin's Folk]] and founded a [[Dwarf realms|colony]] in the caves, becoming the [[Lord of the Glittering Caves]]. The Dwarves of the Glittering Caves carefully tended the stone walls and opened new ways and chambers and hung lamps that filled the caverns with light.<ref>{{TT|Road}}</ref> The Glittering Caves became one of the most important realms of the [[Dwarves]] at the beginning of the [[Fourth Age]].<ref>{{App|Durin}}, pp. 1080-81</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Aglarond'' is [[Sindarin]] and contains the elements ''[[aglar]]'' (\"brilliance\",<ref name=N>{{HM|N}}, note removed by J.R.R Tolkien from the Nomenclature, pp. 421 and 751</ref> \"radiance\", glory\"<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, entry S '''aglar''', p. 24</ref>) and ''[[rond]]'' (\"vault\", \"high roofed cavern\"),<ref name=N/><ref>{{L|211}}</ref> which is translated as \"Glittering Caves\"<ref>{{TT|Road}}, p. 548</ref> or \"Caves of Radiance.<ref name=11c>{{UT|11c}}, footnote relating to Aglarond</ref> Since the word ''aglar'' is derived from the stem KAL- (\"light\")<ref name=PE17/>\"Glittering Caves\" can be the exact translation.\n\nIts [[Rohirric]] name, which was \"translated\" as [[Old English]] ''Glǽmscrafu'' (the ''sc'' is pronounced as ''[sh]'') also meant \"Caves of Radiance\".<ref name=11c/>\n\n==Inspiration==\nThe Glittering Caves are one of very few locations in [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s work that are associated with a real place. They were inspired by the [[wikipedia:Cheddar Gorge and Caves|caves in Cheddar Gorge]] in [[wikipedia:Somerset|Somerset]].<ref>{{L|321}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===The Glittering Caves in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers - The Glittering Caves.jpg|''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Glittering Caves.jpg|''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n'''2013: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Glittering Caves are one of the five major battlegrounds in the game's representation of the [[Battle of the Hornburg]].
