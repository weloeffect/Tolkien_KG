At its southern end, beneath the mountain [[Starkhorn]], stood [[Dunharrow]], an ancient structure of the [[Oathbreakers|Men of the Mountains]], later used as a refuge of the [[Rohirrim]]. On its east side stood the saw-toothed peak [[Írensaga]], while on its far south-east there stood [[Dwimorberg]], the Haunted Mountain, where lay the entrance to the [[Paths of the Dead]].\n\nHamlets in the dale were [[Underharrow]] and [[Upbourn]]. At its northern end, where the Snowbourn issued onto the plains of [[Rohan]], stood Rohan's capital, [[Edoras]].\n\nDuring the [[War of the Ring]] the Lord of Harrowdale was [[Dúnhere]]. It was there that the muster of [[Rohan]] took place on [[10 March]]<ref>{{app|Great}}</ref> before [[Théoden]] led his riders to [[Minas Tirith]]<ref>{{RK|V3}}</ref> and the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], where Théoden and Dúnhere were killed.\n\n== Portrayal in adaptations ==\n'''2013: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Harrowdale is treated as part of the \"Kingstead\" area of the [[Westemnet]]. In the absence of [[Dúnhere]], it is led by his wife Ellen Fremedon, whose name is taken from the ''Beowulf''.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Valleys]]\n[[Category:Rohan]]\n[[de:Hargtal]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/reliefs/montagnes blanches/harrowdale]]\n[[fi:Hargin laakso]]"}}}
