His hosts were then joined by many of the [[Ilkorindi|lost kindreds]].<ref name=Gilfanon/> \n\nTareg and his host eventually arrived in the northwest of the [[Great Lands]], where they met the exiled Gnomes at the [[Mereth Aderthad|Feast of Reunion]], as well as the [[Men]] led by [[Ermon]], who were about to prepare for a war with [[Melko]]. There, Tareg joined forces with the host of [[Finwë|Nólemë]] (the leader of the Gnomes), along with the sons of Ermon, and, at a place called [[Gorfalong]], fought a [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad|great battle]] with Melko and his forces, many of whom were Men corrupted by Melko.<ref>{{LT1|X}}, ''The History of the Exiled Gnomes according to the later outline'', pp. 240-1</ref>\n\nHowever, nothing else is known about Tareg's fate after the battle.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''Tareg'' seems to be in [[Gnomish]] according to [[Paul Strack]], but no etymology is given.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1733870009.html|articlename=G.
