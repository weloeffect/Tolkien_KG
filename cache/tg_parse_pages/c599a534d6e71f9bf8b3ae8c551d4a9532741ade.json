It was translated by [[Christopher Tolkien]] and published in [[1960]], when he was a lecturer in Old English at Oxford. The book was part of ''Nelson's Icelandic Texts'' series.\n\nThe book includes both the translated English text and the Icelandic original, together with Christopher's introduction, notes, and appendices.\n\nIn [[2010]] the book was reprinted in the original format by [[HarperCollins]]. And in [[2025]], to celebrate Christopher's centenary it has been reissued in paperback, this time including Christopher's essay \"The Battle of the Goths and the Huns\" from [[1955]].\n\n==From the publisher==\n{{blockquote|Christopher Tolkien’s masterly translation of the Icelandic Heidrek’s Saga, including the dramatic Battle of the Goths and the Huns, the lyrical Waking of Angantyr, and the unique riddle-contest between King Heidrek and the god Odin.\n\nHeidrek’s Saga is a medieval entertainment – a ‘romance’, but a romance that derives little of its matter from the literature of France or Germany. It is an example of a kind of story-telling that was flourishing in Iceland by the beginning of the twelfth century, and which (in contrast to the more celebrated ‘Sagas of the Icelanders’) told of legendary figures whose origins lie far back in time beyond the settlement of the country.\n\nThe elements of the story, diverse in age and atmosphere, are unified in the theme of a possession bearing an ancestral curse, as it passes down the generations; but the saga’s peculiar value lies in the older poems which the unknown author set into the framework of his narrative, including The Battle of the Goths and the Huns, perhaps the oldest of all the Northern heroic lays, The Waking of Angantyr, source of many eighteenth-century ‘Gothic Odes’, and the unique riddle-contest between King Heidrek and the god Odin in disguise.\n\nTranslated from the Icelandic with Introduction, Notes and Appendices by Christopher Tolkien, then Lecturer in Old English at New College, Oxford, The Saga of King Heidrek the Wise was first published in 1960 in Nelson’s Icelandic Texts series. Marking Christopher Tolkien's centenary, this first ever paperback edition also includes his original essay 'The Battle of the Goths and the Huns' as a bonus chapter.}}\n\n==Publication history and gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"125px\" heights=\"125px\">\nFile:The Saga of King Heidrek the Wise 1960.png|1960 hardcover & 2010 reprint\nFile:The Saga of King Heidrek the Wise 2025.jpg|2025 paperback\n</gallery>\n* London: Thomas Nelson & Sons, hardcover ([[1960]])\n* [[HarperCollins]] hardcover ([[2010]]), pp.&nbsp;208.
