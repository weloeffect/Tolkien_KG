The northern border of Minihiriath is not recorded and could have been anywhere between the [[Greenway]] and the [[Great East Road]].<ref name=Map>{{UT|Map}}</ref><ref group=note>The entry in the Annals of the Kings that most of the people of Cardolan died in the Great Plague, especially in Minhiriath, implies that Minhiriath is only a part of Cardolan. According to those Annals the northern border of Cardolan was the Great East Road.</ref> Minhiriath consisted primarily of open plains without mountains.<ref name=FirstParagraph/>\n\n[[The Shire]] was northwest of the river Baranduin across the [[Sarn Ford]]. The dark forest of [[Eryn Vorn]] was on a cape on the coast of Minhiriath. The region [[Enedwaith]] was east of the Gwathló. The city of [[Tharbad]] was on the Gwathló on the border between Minhiriath and Enedwaith. The port of [[Lond Daer]] was also on the Gwathló where it flowed into the Sea.<ref name=Map/>\n\n==History==\n===Earliest inhabitants===\nMany of the inhabitants of the forests in Minhiriath were of the same kind as the [[Haladin|Folk of Haleth]], the second folk of the [[Edain]]. They moved westwards later than the Folk of Haleth and had stayed in [[Eriador]] either in settlements or wandering around and had not moved on to [[Beleriand]]. The language of the Folk of Haleth was not related to the language of the [[House of Hador|Folk of Hador]] and the [[House of Bëor|Folk of Bëor]] from which [[Adûnaic]], the language of the Númenóreans was descended.<ref name=Atani>{{PM|Atani}}, including Note 72</ref>\n\n===Second Age===\nAt the time of the explorations of [[Aldarion]], the heir of the King of [[Númenor]], Minhiriath was covered by an almost continuous forest with the exception of the great fens of the [[Swanfleet]] and near the ford of Tharbad. The native inhabitants were quite numerous and warlike and lived in scattered communities in the forests without a central leadership. In the beginning the native inhabitants of Minhiriath were in awe of the Númenóreans.<ref name=ThirdParagraph>{{UT|6d}}, discussion of the river Gwathló, third paragraph</ref> It is probable that the felling of trees by Númenóreans in Minhiriath was on a small scale during the the time of the explorations of Aldarion and during his reign and that he even had trees replanted in Minhiriath, because it is recorded that Aldarion only sailed with a small number of ships to Middle-earth, built only a small number of ships in Middle-earth and returned only with a small number of ships with a cargo of timber from Middle-earth. It is also mentioned that Aldarion always planted new trees where trees had been felled in Númenor and that he offered to show his betrothed Erendis forests wider than Númenor wild and free in Middle-earth. During a voyage from {{SA|829}} to {{SA|843}} Aldarion found out that his recently built harbour and shipyard of [[Vinyalondë]] at the mouth of the river Gwathló had been overthrown by storm floods and plundered by hostile men. During another voyage to Middle-earth from {{SA|863}} to {{SA|869}} Aldarion learned that Men near the coasts were growing afraid of the Númenóreans or had become openly hostile to the Númenóreans and heard rumours of a lord in Middle-earth that hated the Númenóreans.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}</ref>\n\nIt is probable that the felling of trees for shipbuilding by Númenóreans in Minhiriath continued to be on a small scale or stopped after the death of Aldarion, because it is told that his daughter [[Tar-Ancalimë]] neglected all policies of her father and provided no further aid to [[Gil-galad]] in [[Lindon]] after the death of her father. At the time of the earlier settlements of the Númenóreans Minhiriath was still covered with a dense forest.<ref>{{PM|Atani}}</ref> In the beginning the Númenóreans felled trees along both banks of the river Gwathló and floated the logs down the river to the timber-port and ship-building harbour of Lond Daer at the mouth of the Gwathló that was formerly called Vinyalondë.<ref name=ThirdParagraph/>\n\nAt the latest during the rule of Queen [[Tar-Telperiën]] the Númenóreans built great tracks and roads into the forests northwards and southwards from the Gwathló and the felling of the trees for the building of a large fleet of ships at the shipyards of Lond Daer and other shipyards in Middle-earth and in Númenor became devastating to the forests, because the Númenóreans did not replant new trees. As a reaction, the native inhabitants who lived in those forests became hostile and ambushed the Númenóreans when they had an opportunity. As a consequence, the Númenóreans treated the native inhabitants as enemies. The natives that survived the conflicts with the Númenóreans fled into the dark woods of the cape of Eryn Vorn.<ref name=ThirdParagraph/> \n\nAfter the forces of Sauron had invaded Eriador in {{SA|1695}}<ref name=Concerning>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref> the exiled natives welcomed Sauron and hoped that he would defeat the Númenóreans and acted as spies and guides for the raiders of Sauron. The raiders of Sauron set fire to the woods on the edges of the forest and burned the woodstores of the Númenóreans, but he could not spare enough forces to attack the forts that the Númenóreans had built on the banks of the river Gwathló.<ref>{{UT|6d}}, discussion of the river Gwathló, fourth paragraph</ref> \n\nIn the year {{SA|1700}} the forces of Sauron had reached the line of the river [[Lhûn]]. This was defended by Gil-galad and by a force of [[Númenóreans]] that had been stationed in Lindon after Gil-galad had asked the Númenóreans for help when he feared that Sauron could invade Eriador. After a Númenórean force of the Númenórean admiral [[Ciryatur]] had landed at the [[Grey Havens]], the forces of the [[Elves of Lindon]] and the Númenóreans defeated the forces of Sauron and drove them back. The forces of Sauron suffered heavy casualties at [[Sarn Ford]] and were driven further to the south-east. At [[Tharbad]] the forces of Sauron were joined by reinforcements that had come from the south-east, but they were surprised by another force of Númenóreans in their rear, who had landed at Lond Dear. Sauron's forces were utterly routed in the [[Battle of the Gwathló]] and Sauron narrowly escaped with a small remaining force to the south-east to [[Calenardhon]].<ref name=Concerning>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>\n\nAfter the defeat of Sauron at the end of the War of the Elves and Sauron most of the old forests on sides of the Gwathló had been destroyed.<ref>{{UT|6d}}, discussion of the river Gwathló, fifth paragraph</ref>\n\nIn {{SA|3320}},<ref>{{App|SA}}, entry for the year 3320, p. 1084</ref> Minhiriath became a part of the kingdom of Arnor.<ref>{{UT|6d}}, discussion of the name Glanduin, first paragraph</ref>\n\n===Third Age===\n[[Image:Matěj Čadil - Minhiriath.jpg|thumb|left|[[Matěj Čadil]] - ''Minhiriath'']]\nWhen the Kingdom of Arnor was divided in {{TA|861}},<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 861, p. 1085</ref> Minhiriath became a part of [[Cardolan]], one of the three successor states of Arnor.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', first paragraph, p. 1039</ref> After the [[Great Plague]] spread north-west from Gondor in {{TA|1636}},<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1636, p. 1086</ref> most of the people of Cardolan died, especially in Minhiriath.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', entry for king Argeleb II, p. 1041</ref> After that Minhiriath was almost completely deserted, but a secretive folk of hunters lived in the woods.<ref name=SecondParagraph>{{UT|6d}}, discussion of the name Gwathló, second paragraph</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Fell Winter (Third Age)|Fell Winter]] of {{TA|2911}},<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2911, p. 1089</ref> Minhiriath was devastated by great floods and Tharbad was ruined and deserted in {{TA|2912}}.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2912, p. 1089</ref>\n\nAlthough Minhiriath was still thickly forested in several places by the time of the [[War of the Ring]], most of the plains were grasslands.<ref name=SecondParagraph/>\n\nAfter the War of the Ring at the end of the [[Third Age]], the North-kingdom of Arnor was reestablished by [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, p. 1042</ref> It is probable that Minhiriath was resettled, because [[Gandalf]] announced that the Greenway would be opened again, that there would be people and fields where there was wilderness before and that there would be room enough for people along the shorelands south of the Baranduin.<ref>{{RK|Homeward}}, p. 992</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Minhiriath'' is a [[Sindarin]] name.<ref name=Eldamo>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-1206108635.html|articlename=S.
