In the late [[Third Age]], the Silvan Elves mostly belonged either to the [[Galadhrim]] or to the [[Elves of Mirkwood]].<ref name=\"SE-UTa\"/>\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Nandor}}\nThe Silvan Elves were descendants of the [[Nandor]] - and thus in origin part of the [[Teleri]] - who had lingered in the [[Vales of Anduin]] during the [[Great Journey]] of the [[Eldar]] in the [[Elder Days]]. The Silvan Elves hid themselves in their woodland realms beyond the [[Misty Mountains]] and became a scattered folk hardly distinguishable from [[Avari]], the Dark Elves.<ref name=\"SE-UTa\">{{UT|6a}}</ref> While some of the Nandor continued to [[Eriador]] and later entered [[Beleriand]], they remained in the Vales of Anduin, and from these latter originated the Silvan Elves.<ref name=\"SE-UTa\"/>\n\nIt is also told that the some of the western [[Avari]], dwelling in Eriador and the Vales of Anduin, were friendly to the [[Eldar]], and came to merge with the Wood-elves. These were [[Nelyar]]in Avari ([[Penni]]), and therefore remotely akin to the Nandor and Sindar.<ref group=note>It is not known if this merge occurred during the [[Elder Days]], or during the [[Second Age|Second]] or [[Third Age]]s.</ref><ref>{{WJ|C}}, pp. 381, 410</ref>\n\nIn the early [[Second Age]], many [[Teleri]], survivors of [[Doriath]] and [[Ossiriand]], left [[Lindon]] to establish woodland realms among the Silvan Elves.<ref name=rings>{{S|Rings}}</ref> It was before the building of the [[Dark Tower]] in c. {{SA|1000}} that the [[Sindar]] made this migration.<ref name=SA>{{App|SA}}</ref> \n\n==History==\n===Greenwood the Great===\n{{main|Elves of Mirkwood}}\nIn the early [[Second Age]], [[Oropher]] of [[Doriath]] (father of [[Thranduil]] and grandfather of [[Legolas]]) along with few other [[Sindar]] came to [[Greenwood the Great]], east of the [[Misty Mountains]]. There, he became the King of the Silvan Elves east of Anduin and established the [[Woodland Realm]] in {{SA|750}}.<ref>{{PM|Second}}, p. 174</ref> The culture of the Silvan folk was rude and rustic in comparison to the [[Beleriand]]ic culture of the Sindar but soon enough, the Sindar had merged with the Silvan Elves and adopted their language, taking names of Silvan form and style.<ref name=\"Sindarin Princes\">{{UT|6b}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Silvan Elves initially dwelt in the south of the Wood,<ref name=\"Sindarin Princes\"/> centred around [[Amon Lanc]],<ref name=\"Note 14\"/> they constantly retreated northwards (thrice in the [[Second Age]])<ref name=\"Note 14\">{{UT|Gladden}}, note 14</ref> and after the [[Shadow]] had fallen upon [[Mirkwood]] by the mid-[[Third Age]], the Silvan Elves dwelt in the far north-east of the forest. Their king, [[Thranduil]] (the son of [[Oropher]], who was slain in the [[War of the Last Alliance]]), built an [[Elvenking's Halls|underground fortress]] for himself and his people inspired by [[Thingol]]'s [[Menegroth]] in the far [[Elder Days]].<ref name=\"Sindarin Princes\"/>\n\n===Lothlórien===\n{{main|Galadhrim}}\nLittle is known of their early history save that in the [[Second Age]], they were ruled by a [[Sindar]]in prince named [[Amdír]]. After the destruction of [[Eregion]] in {{SA|1697}}, many of its exiles, both [[Noldor]] and [[Sindar]], escaped through [[Khazad-dûm]] into the east, and had joined the Silvan Elves of Lórien and mingled with them.<ref name=\"Galadriel\">{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>\n\n[[Amdír]] was lost in the [[War of the Last Alliance]] so his son, [[Amroth]], succeeded to his kingship. During his reign, [[Durin's Bane]] was unleashed in [[Khazad-dûm]] and many of Lórien's people fled south to [[Edhellond]]. [[Amroth]] himself was among them, and he was drowned in the [[Bay of Belfalas]]. It was at this time that [[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]] became the [[Lord and Lady of Lórien]].<ref name=ta>{{App|TA}}</ref>\n\n===Later history===\nAlthough both Silvan realms were invaded in the [[War of the Ring]], the fall of [[Sauron]] ushered in a long peace whence the Silvan Elves in the now-cleansed [[Eryn Lasgalen]] long remained untroubled. Now the Silvan Elves once again dwelt in the south of the Wood, but these were [[Elves of Lórien]] who crossed the [[Anduin]] to live in a new realm named [[East Lórien]]. Though the original land of [[Lothlórien]] faded after the passing of [[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]], the Silvan Elves of the Wood lived peacefully under their trees for many long years.<ref group=note>It is not clear if most [[Galadhrim]] either followed [[Galadriel]] and later [[Celeborn]] or just migrated to [[East Lórien]]; however, it is said that \"[[Celeborn]] took the southern wood below the [[Narrows]], and named it [[East Lórien]].\"</ref><ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English adjective ''[[Wiktionary:silvan|silvan]]'' means \"of, characteristic of, or consisting of woods or forests\" or \"living or located in woods or forests\".<ref>\"[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/silvansilvan]\" at [http://dictionary.reference.com Dictionary.reference.com](Collins English Dictionary; accessed 17 July 2011)</ref>\n\n==Other names==\nAn [[Elvish]] name for the Silvan Elves was '''''Tawarwaith'''''<ref>{{UT|6a}}, p. 256</ref>.
