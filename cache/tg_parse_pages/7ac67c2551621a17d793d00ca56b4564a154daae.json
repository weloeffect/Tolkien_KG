At his son [[Thráin|Thráin II]]'s behest, all Seven Houses were rallied, and in three years the host was gathered and set out to avenge the elder father of their race.\n\n===Date===\nIt is insinuated that when the coalition set out for war the first place targeted was Mount Gundabad. For the war lasted six years, and the Dwarves campaign seems to have been one that started in the far north (Gundabad) and place by place, they made their way south (the [[Gladden River|Gladden]]). It can, therefore, be assumed that Gundabad was set upon in the outset.\n\n==The Battle==\nThe Mountain was assailed and sacked by the great host of King Thráin sometime in 2793 and was abandoned when it was totally eradicated of [[Orcs]] sometime later.<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe Dwarves annihilated the Orcs they could find at Gundabad, but with their host continuing on the crusade of vengeance down the [[Misty Mountains]] the land was left empty and (at some point) during or after the War's end in 2799 the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] returned to their self-proclaimed capitol, and reestablished it as a stronghold and hub.\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Conflicts of the Third Age]]"}}}
