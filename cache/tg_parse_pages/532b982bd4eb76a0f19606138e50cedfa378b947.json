Sometimes they used Darkness as a frightening [[Darkness (concept)|concept]] to coax people to rely on them for protection, while at other times the Dark Lords utilized Darkness as an actual force. This article relates time periods in which the rebellious [[Valar|Powers]] spread literal Darkness over places on Earth. \n\n== Great Darkness ==\nThe '''Great Darkness''' was an uncertain term used by [[Treebeard]] the [[Ents|Ent]], apparently referring to the time of the [[First Age]] and before when [[Middle-earth]] was under the dominion of [[Morgoth|Melkor]].<ref>{{HM|Guide}}</ref> \n\nWhen the Great Darkness came, the [[Elves]] passed over the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] and fled or hid. It was in the Great Darkness before the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]] that [[Morgoth|Melkor]] first created the [[Orcs]] and the [[Trolls]], so that these creatures feared sunlight and shunned it. The Darkness was not dispelled by the coming of the Sun: Morgoth held his fortress of [[Angband]] for centuries afterwards, and kept it shrouded in darkness with vapors belched forth from [[Thangorodrim]], the mountains around Angband.\n\nAccording to Treebeard, the Darkness had never been lifted in some hollow dales of his land, and there was still some shadow left by in the north<ref>{{TT|III4}}</ref> (perhaps referring to [[Mirkwood]]).\n\n== In [[Valinor]] ==\nMorgoth, aided by the power of [[Ungoliant]] the Spider, also used Darkness to devastating effect in his attack on the [[Two Trees of Valinor]]. After Ungoliant drank up their light, a debilitating darkness settled around the [[Aman|Blessed Realm]] that confounded the might of even most of the [[Valar]]. Aided by this force, which was more than merely a lack of light but also \"had power to pierce the eye, and to enter heart and mind, and strangle the very will\", Morgoth escaped from Valinor and revenged himself upon the Valar and [[Elves]]. Only the sharp eyes of [[Manwë]] could penetrate this shroud, but it was to no avail: Morgoth used the cover of Darkness to slay [[Finwë]] and capture the [[Silmarils]] of [[Fëanor]].<ref>{{S|Darkening}}</ref>\n\n== During the [[Third Age]] ==\n\"Darkness\" was a term usually used symbolically for the dark power of [[Sauron]] and the regions under his sway. During the [[War of the Ring]], though, Sauron's Darkness became a dreadful reality, as it spread out of [[Mordor]] on [[10 March]] {{TA|3019}}<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> and covered the lands of the West for many days. It caused despair among the soldiers of [[Gondor]] who were fighting Sauron's forces. Eventually, however, a wind from the South broke it apart.<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref>\n\n== Night and Darkness ==\nIdeally, Night was supposed to be a peaceful time, no more threatening than Day. The [[Valar]] had intended it as period of rest and repose, in which one could view the stars of [[Varda]]. But the association of Night with Darkness and Morgoth's power caused it to become \"a time of peril unseen, of fear without form, an uneasy vigil; or a haunted dream, leading through despair to the shadow of Death\". These connotations were especially strong in Middle-earth; in safer lands such as [[Aman]] the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] could still enjoy Night as originally intended.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Darkness (concept)]]\n* [[Shadow]] (a more abstract and general term)\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Weapons]]"}}}
