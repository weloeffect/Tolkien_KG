Tolkien]] edited by [[Christopher Tolkien]]. The chapter is an account of the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen|first]] and [[Second Battle of the Fords of Isen|second]] attacks on the critical crossing of the River [[Isen]] during which [[Théoden|King Théoden's]] son, [[Théodred]] was slain, paving the way to the [[Battle of the Hornburg|assault]] on the [[Hornburg]], the stronghold of [[Rohan]].\n\n==Synposis==\nThe main obstacles to [[Saruman|Saruman’s]] conquest over Rohan were Théodred and [[Éomer]]. Because of this, in the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]], Saruman made sure that Théodred would die. Théodred took his riders to meet Saruman’s forces at the [[Fords of Isen|Fords]], but was slowed by ambushes from the enemy. When Théodred arrived at the Fords, he set [[Grimbold]] in charge of fifty men on the west bank, and the rest on the east bank. He positioned his own company on the small island on the water.\n\nSaruman’s eastern forces came with unexpected speed and ferocity, made up of [[Dunlendings|Dunlending]] horsemen and [[Wolf-riders|Orcish wolfriders]]. As the eastern side was being overtaken, Grimbold was being attacked on his side, and the enemy was closing in on Théodred from both sides. Grimbold came to his aid too late, and Théodred fell at his side. When it seemed they were done for, a great host led by [[Elfhelm]] drove off the enemy.\n\n[[Erkenbrand]] assumed command of the [[West-mark]], and in anticipation for a [[Second Battle of the Fords of Isen|second battle]], asked Théoden for reinforcements. This was denied due to the advice of [[Gríma]]. Erkenbrand gave field command to Grimbold, who coordinated with Elfhelm to protect the Fords. Grimbold protected the west bank, while Elfhelm waited farther on the east side. Saruman’s troops attacked on [[2 March]], forcing Grimbold across the Isen. In the night, Grimbold’s forces were scattered, and Elfhelm was fighting the rest of Saruman’s army from Isengard. In the late afternoon of [[3 March]], Grimbold met [[Gandalf]], and followed his advice to join Elfhelm in the south.\n\nHere, the text is abruptly cut off.\n\n===Appendix===\nThe Appendix of the chapter details the military ranks of the [[Rohirrim]]. The Marshals of the Mark were the three lieutenants of the [[King of Rohan|King]]. Théoden had no [[First Marshal of the Riddermark|First Marshal]], and would command the [[Muster of Edoras]] himself. When Éomer became King, he replaced these three positions with the [[Marshal of the West-mark]] and the [[Marshal of the East-mark]].\n\nAlso included is a discussion of the importance of the [[Fords of Isen]] and the time when [[Dunlendings]] occupied Isengard.\n[[Category:Manuscripts by J.R.R.
