He was slain when attempting to resist the incursion of [[Orc]]s that were gathering to assault [[Nargothrond]].  \n\n== History ==\nHandir's father, [[Haldir (Chieftain of the Haladin)|Haldir]], joined the [[Union of Maedhros]], and led many Men of [[Brethil]] to the [[Battle of Unnumbered Tears]]. As the battle turned against [[Eldar]] and the [[Edain]], Haldir was slain in the rearguard of [[Fingon]], along with most of the Men of Brethil.<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref> Those that survived still had to find their way back through the evil road of [[Taur-nu-Fuin]],<ref name=ch4>{{CH|4}}</ref> and in the end only three Men who had accompanied Haldir returned, healed of their wounds and brought back by [[Mablung]].<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}</ref> \n\nIt is not said if Handir was among those who joined the battle, but with the death of his father, he became the leader of the Haladin. News of his father's death also caused his mother, [[Glóredhel]], to fall into grief and die.<ref name=ch4>{{CH|4}}</ref>\n\nAround {{FA|485}} a large group of [[Orc]]s crossed the [[Brithiach]]. Though Handir resisted them with all the force he could muster, they continued and passed south over the [[Crossings of Teiglin]] in search of plunder.<ref>{{CH|6}}</ref> \n\nStarting in {{FA|490|n}} the Elves of Nargothrond, under the leadership of [[Túrin]], went openly to battle and drove the Orcs out of [[West Beleriand]]; in doing so however they revealed themselves to the wrath of [[Morgoth]].<ref>{{GA|272}}</ref> In the spring of {{FA|495|n}},<ref>{{GA|295}}</ref> the Orcs invaded the lands of Handir in order to secure the Crossings of Teiglin in preparation for an assault against Nargothrond.<ref name=ch11>{{CH|11}}</ref> Handir gave them battle, but he was slain and his folk driven back into the woods.<ref name=ch11 /> The Orcs did not pursue them, and continued to muster their strength until their [[Battle of Tumhalad|assault against Nargothrond that autumn]].<ref name=ch11 />\n\nWith the death of Handir, his son Brandir became the next chieftain.<ref>{{GA|291}}</ref>\n\n== Family ==\nHandir was the son of [[Haldir (Chieftain of the Haladin)|Haldir]] and [[Glóredhel]], and thus double first cousin of [[Húrin]] and [[Huor]]. He married [[Beldis]] of the [[House of Bëor]], and was the father of Brandir the Lame.<ref>{{WJ|14c}}, ''(iii) The Haladin''', p. 237</ref>\n\nBeldis was a late introduction into the legendarium and was notably older than Haldir; while Handir was born in {{FA|441|n}}, Beldis was stated as being born in {{FA|411|n}}.<ref>{{WJ|14c}}, ''(i) The House of Bëor'''</ref> [[Christopher Tolkien]] does not provide commentary on the age gap, nor on Beldis apparently becoming a mother to Brandir (born {{FA|465|n}}) at 54 years old.\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | HLD | | | | | | | | | | |HLD=[[Haldan]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | HMR | | | | | | | | | | |HMR=[[Halmir]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |,|-|-|-|v|-|^|-|v|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree | GLO |y| HDR | | HUN | | HAR |y| GAL | | HIR |GLO=[[Glóredhel]]|HDR=[[Haldir (Chieftain of the Haladin)|Haldir]]|HUN=[[Hundar]]|HAR=[[Hareth]]|GAL=[[Galdor (Lord of Dor-lómin)|Galdor]]|HIR=[[Hiril]]}}\n{{familytree | | | |!| | | | | | | | | |,|-|^|-|.| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | HAN |y| BEL | | | | HUO | | HUR | | | | |HAN='''HANDIR'''|BEL=[[Beldis]]|HUO=[[Huor]]|HUR=[[Húrin]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | BRA | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |BRA=[[Brandir]]}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n=== ''The Book of Lost Tales'' ===\nIn ''[[Turambar and the Foalókë]]'', '''Bethos''' was a stout man and the chief of the wood-rangers with whom [[Túrin]] dwelt. As a youth, he had fought in, and escaped from, the [[Battle of Unnumbered Tears]]. His wife, \"as the tale telleth\", was a fair [[Noldo]]-maiden and they had many fair sons and daughters save their eldest, Tamar Lamefoot.<ref name=tatf>{{LT2|II}}</ref>\n\nWhen Túrin brought a rescued [[Níniel]] back to their settlement, she dwelt in the house of Bethos. Bethos himself was slain not long after in an foray as, despite his years, he still rode abroad. Túrin was then chosen as the new chief of the wood-rangers, rather than Tamar.<ref name=tatf />\n\nIn Christopher Tolkien's commentary, he noted the extraordinary statement that Bethos had a Elven wife, and that it contradicted the statement elsewhere that [[Eärendel]] alone was a child of both races. Christopher also notes the discrepancy of Bethos being \"but a boy\" at the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, and considered old (\"despite his years\") at the time of his death.<ref>{{LT2|IIn}}</ref>\n\n=== ''The Shaping of Middle-earth'' ===\nIn ''[[The Quenta]]'', Handir became the father of Brandir. Handir was the son of [[Haleth#Other versions of the legendarium|Haleth]], who in turn was the son of [[Hador]].<ref>{{SM|CQ13}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Earliest Annals of Beleriand]]'', Handir became the son of [[Hundor]], son of Haleth. Between the years 190-195, Handir allied his people with the Gnomes of [[Nargothrond]] who, led by Túrin, drove the Orcs from [[West Beleriand]]. He was slain when [[Glómund]] and a host of Orcs defeated the forces of Nargothrond.<ref>{{SM|7I}}</ref>\n\n=== ''The War of the Jewels'' ===\nIn a struck-out passage, it was Handir who accompanied Húrin when, by the fate or will of [[Ulmo]], they found the hidden entrance to [[Gondolin]]. They were welcomed by [[Turgon]] and eventually released after swearing oaths of secrecy of the location of the city.<ref>{{GA|§149–50}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n|race=edain\n|house=[[House of Haleth]]\n|born={{FA|441}}\n|died={{FA|495}}\n}}\n{{seq\n|pvac=\n|prev=[[Haldir (Chieftain of the Haladin)|Haldir]]\n|next=[[Brandir]]\n|list=[[Chieftain of the Haladin]]\n|dates={{FA|472}} - {{FA|495|n}}\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:Chieftains of Brethil]]\n[[Category:Edain]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:House of Haleth]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n[[de:Handir]]\n[[fi:Handir]]"}}}
