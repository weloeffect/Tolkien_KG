Tolkien]], most of them had been published in a series of [[:Category:Official calendars|calendars]] by [[George Allen and Unwin|George Allen & Unwin]] for the years [[1974]] and [[1976]]-[[1979]]. Some of these that were previously published only in truncated form are now seen in full.\n\nThe first edition was published by George Allen & Unwin on [[1 November]] [[1979]]. It includes a foreword and notes by [[Christopher Tolkien]].\n\nThe book was revised in [[1992]], in which a preface was added by Christopher, the texts were revised, and item 22 and 24 were re-numbered as 23 and 24.\n\n==From the publisher <small>(2021 edition)</small>==\n{{blockquote|This collection of pictures, with text by Christopher Tolkien, now reissued after almost 30 years confirms J.R.R. Tolkien’s considerable talent as an artist. It provides fascinating insight into his visual conception of many of the places and events familiar to readers of The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion.\n\nExamples of his art range from delicate watercolours depicting Rivendell, the Forest of Lothlorien, Smaug, and Old Man Willow, to drawings and sketches of Moria Gate and Minas Tirith. Together they form a comprehensive collection of Tolkien’s own illustrations for his most popular books.\n\nAlso included are many of his beautiful designs showing patterns of flowers and trees, friezes, tapestries and heraldic devices associated with the world of Middle-earth. In their variety and scope they provide abundant visual evidence of the richness of his imagination.}}\n\n==Pictures==\n<div style=\"-moz-column-width: 400px; -webkit-column-width: 400px; column-width: 400px; -moz-column-gap: 15px; -webkit-column-gap: 15px; column-gap: 15px; -webkit-column-rule: 1px solid #cccccc; -moz-column-rule: 1px solid #cccccc; column-rule: 1px solid #cccccc;\">\n# [[The Hill: Hobbiton-across-the Water]]\n# [[:File:J.R.R.
