He was the son of Sir [[Stanley Unwin]], co-founder of the  publishing firm.\n\n==Biography==\nRayner was the second son of Sir [[Stanley Unwin]] after [[Wikipedia:David Severn|David]]. His second cousin was Harold \"Chris\" Unwin, who later would serve in R.A.F. with [[Christopher Tolkien]] and would become close friends.<ref>{{L|98}}</ref>\n\nHe reviewed [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Hobbit]]'' at age 10 and without his praise of the book it might never have been published. \n\nTolkien appreciated young Rayner's taste and considered him a good critic. While still planning on a sequel to ''The Hobbit'' in [[1938]], he wanted to send him the drafts; being uncertain about the  [[A Long-expected Party|first chapter]] of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', he thought Rayner's opinion would encourage him to follow the story.<ref>{{L|18}}</ref><ref>{{L|21}}</ref> Rayner didn't enjoy the next chapters as they had too much \"hobbit talk\".<ref>{{L|28}}</ref>\n\nIn summer [[1944]] Unwin was reading English at [[Oxford]] as a naval cadet.<ref>{{L|74}}</ref>\n\nIn the meantime Tolkien resented that Stanley Unwin wouldn't wait to publish his ''[[Silmarillion]]'', and while writing ''The Lord of the Rings'' he hoped that both would be published together. He also hoped that he would reach an agreement with London publisher [[Collins]].<ref>{{L|123}}</ref> The Unwins were concerned about the resulting size of ''The Lord of the Rings'', while Tolkien insisted that it would not be cut, while also insisting that it belonged to the same Saga as ''The Silmarillion'' and would not be published separately.<ref>{{L|124}}</ref> Asked his opinion on these issues by his father, Rayner wrote that despite Tolkien's connecting the two works, he did not feel the lack of ''The Silmarillion''. He proposed to have Tolkien or one of his sons edit ''The Lord of the Rings'' accordingly, incorporating parts of ''The Silmarillion'' as needed; otherwise they could just publish ''The Lord of the Rings'' and reject ''The Silmarillion'' later. Although this letter was not intended to be seen by Tolkien, Stanley sent it,<ref>{{L|127}}</ref> disappointing Tolkien, who eventually turned to Collins.<ref name=rc>{{HM|RC}}</ref>{{rp|p. xxx}}\n\nUltimately Tolkien wasn't able to reach an agreement with Collins either. In late [[1951]] Rayner wrote to Tolkien, and again the [[1952|next year]] enquiring about ''[[Errantry]]'' and his publishing process (''The Lord of the Rings'' remained unpublished). They exchanged letters with kind and warm words, with Tolkien humbly admitting his bad behavior and compromising<ref>{{L|133}}, p. 163</ref> and Rayner expressing his interest in reading again ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Silmarillion'' and promising to discuss the latter in a more appropriate time. This seemed to end their dispute and enabled Tolkien to revise ''The Lord of the Rings'' once more.<ref name=rc/>{{rp|p. xxxi}}\n\nAfter reading the newly revised book, Rayner telegraphed his father in [[November]] [[1952]] saying that publication of the ''Rings'' was the work of a genius but would be risky; to which Stanley replied \"If you believe it is a work of genius, ''then'' you may lose a thousand pounds\".<ref name=rc/>{{rp|p. xxxii}}\n\nWhile the book was being prepared for publication in the summer of [[1953]], Rayner discussed various details with Tolkien, such as the titles for each of the three volumes,<ref>{{L|136}}, [[Letter 139]]</ref> as it was eventually decided. In his own suggestions, he erroneously proposed ''The Lord of the Rings'' applying to the first volume, without an overall title for the complete work. He also ultimately chose ''[[The Return of the King]]'' for the final volume (instead of ''[[The War of the Ring]]''), despite Tolkien thinking that it gave away the plot.<ref name=rc/>{{rp|p. xxxiii-xxxiv}} That summer he also visited Tolkien in his house (obviously [[76 Sandfield Road]]), and the visit was so hasty that Tolkien neglected to offer him a refreshment.<ref>{{L|140}}</ref>\n\nRayner Unwin and [[Norman Davis]] (Tolkien's successor) planned to commemorate Tolkien's 70th birthday on [[January 3]] [[1963]].<ref>{{L|243}}</ref> Tolkien's and Rayner's friendship remained deep, which Tolkien compared to that of [[Gondor]] and [[Rohan]].<ref>{{L|296}}</ref> At several points Tolkien asked Rayner to stop calling him \"Professor\", which gave an impression of pedantry, and call him \"Ronald\".<ref>{{L|281}}</ref><ref name=l334/> \n\nIn [[1968]], Rayner Unwin followed in his father's footsteps as chairman of the publishing firm; Tolkien lamented that he didn't have enough free time to spend time together any more.<ref>{{L|326}}</ref> On [[28 March]] [[1972]] Tolkien received the [[Order of the British Empire]] at Buckingham Palace; Unwin honoured him with a dinner at the Garrick Club and his firm had arranged their ([[John Tolkien|John]]'s and [[Priscilla Tolkien|Priscilla]]'s) stay at Brown's Hotel in London.<ref name=l334>{{L|334}}</ref>\n\nRayner had a son, Merlin Unwin ([[May]] [[1954]]) the \"second Merlin\" Tolkien knew, agreeing it was more appropriate a name than \"[[Gandalf]]\";<ref>{{L|145}}</ref> and a daughter, Camilla Unwin, who in [[1969]] wrote to Tolkien asking about \"the purpose of life\" for a school project. Tolkien wrote a long letter, which in the same time was too short for that question.<ref>{{L|310}}</ref>\n\nHe retired in [[1985]] and passed away in 2000.\n\n==Bibliography, selected==\n\n===Books===\n\n*[[1992]]: ''[[The Making of The Lord of the Rings]]''\n*[[1999]]: ''[[George Allen and Unwin: A Remembrancer|George Allen & Unwin: A Remembrancer]]''\n\n===Articles===\n\n*[[1936]]: [Manuscript]\n**\"[[Report on the Hobbit]]\"\n*[[1982]]: [[The Sunday Times Magazine 19 September 1982|''The Sunday Times Magazine'' 19 September]]\n**\"The Return of Tolkien\" [interview]\n*[[1987]]: ''[[Science Fiction Chronicle 8]]''\n**\"The Hobbit 50th Anniversary\"\n*[[1992]]: [[Mallorn 29|''Mallorn'' 29]]\n**\"Publishing Tolkien\"\n*[[1993]]: ''[[J.R.R.
