Lewis]] which explores the nature of love from a Christian perspective through thought-experiments and examples from literature. In a passage in the chapter on friendship (\"Philia - Friendship\"), Lewis invokes his friends [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] (\"Ronald\") and [[Charles Williams]] (\"Charles\") as examples: \n\n{{quote|In each of my friends there is something that only some other friend can fully bring out. By myself I am not large enough to call the whole man into activity; I want other lights than my own to show all his facets. Now that Charles is dead, I shall never again see Ronald's reaction to a specifically Caroline joke. Far from having more of Ronald, having him 'to myself' now that Charles is away, I have less of Ronald. ... We possess each friend not less but more as the number of those with whom we share him increases.|C.S.
