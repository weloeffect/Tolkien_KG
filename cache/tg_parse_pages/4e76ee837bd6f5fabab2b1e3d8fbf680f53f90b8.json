Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien']]<nowiki/>s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. The initial script was completed in [[1970]] and would have been produced by [[United Artists]] in collaboration with Boorman's colleague [[Rospo Pallenberg]] and the current film rights holder and producer [[Saul Zaentz]].\n\n==History==\nAfter making ''Leo the Last'' for United Artists, Boorman was asked by head of production David Picker to make a film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings.'' The prospect of creating an adaptation of Tolkien's seminal work intrigued the director, who would go on to say:<blockquote>It was a heady, impossible proposition. If film-making for me is, as I have often said, exploration, setting oneself impossible problems and failing to solve them, then the Rings saga qualifies on all counts.<ref name=\":0\">[[John Boorman]], ''Money Into Light,'' p. 20</ref></blockquote>Recognizing a kindred spirit in then-architect Rospo Pallenberg, Boorman flew the aspiring scriptwriter to Ireland and spent six months developing a script with him. To accomplish this task, Pallenberg pasted every page of ''The Lord of the Rings'' to the four walls of a room in Boorman's house. They then made charts of characters, chronologies, and elaborate cross references - tracking character's movements across a map of [[Middle-earth]] they had devised.<ref name=\":0\" /> In these early stages, they also experimented with many of their own unique ideas, one of which was casting Tolkien to appear at the beginning of the film in order to introduce the story and provide background detail.<ref>James Fenwick, John Boorman’s The Lord of the Rings: A Case Study of an Unmade Film, Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television, p. 13</ref> \n\nHowever, the script would be written in a time when a smattering of British films had failed in the United States. American filmmakers set their sights on films with American locales, making the prospect of producing a prohibitively expensive ''Lord of the Rings Film'' infeasible. After facing rejection from [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] and other studios, Tolkien wrote and asked Boorman how he would do the film.<ref>Indiana University Archives at Lilly Library, John Boorman manuscripts, box 61 \"Letter from John Boorman to Joy Hill\", 15 June 1970</ref> Boorman replied that it would be filmed in live action, which was to Tolkien's great relief.<ref>Indiana University Archives at Lilly Library, John Boorman manuscripts, box 61 \"Letter from Joy Hill to John Boorman\", 19 June 1970 </ref> \n\nHowever, Tolkien's relief would go unfounded, as United Artists would go on to produce an [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|animated ''The Lord of the Rings'' film]] directed by [[Ralph Bakshi]] in [[1978]]. Boorman could never bring himself to watch the film and, to his relief, Tolkien would pass away in [[1973]] before having the opportunity to see it.<ref name=\":0\" /> However, the director would join forces with Rospo Pallenberg again to create the Arthurian epic ''Excalibur'', wherein many concepts from their ''Lord of the Rings'' script were used.\n\nThough Boorman was disappointed that the film didn't get made at the time, he was later grateful that it didn't. More than thirty years later in [[2012]] he said,<blockquote>[We] couldn’t get it made. And really I’m so pleased we didn’t because if I’d made it, rather clumsily at the time, it would mean that [[Peter Jackson|Pete Jackson]]‘s fantastic [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|trilogy]] would not have been made. So he owes a lot to me.<ref>{{Cite web|articleurl=https://www.indiewire.com/news/general-news/john-boorman-talks-almost-making-lord-of-the-rings-working-with-marcello-mastroianni-what-hes-doing-next-more-250223/#blogPostHeaderPanel|articlename=John Boorman Talks Almost Making ‘Lord Of The Rings,’ Working With Marcello Mastroianni, What He’s Doing Next & More|author=Jessica Kiang|dated=17 December 2012|accessed=23 October 2024}}</ref> </blockquote>\n\n==Plot==\n''John Boorman's'' ''The Lord of the Rings'' was planned to run as one long movie with an intermission. The first half of the script was largely based on ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]],'' but many things were changed and added. Following the intermission, writers Boorman and Pallenberg \"dropped things out\" and \"invented as they went along\". \n\nThe story makes many departures from the novel, such as the trip to [[Rivendell]] is framed as a drunken vacation spurred on by [[Gandalf]] (who has just finished telling Frodo to put on the ring ''only if he really needs to'') after the appearance of the [[Nazgûl|Ring Wraiths]] in [[the Shire]] during [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|Bilbo's farewell party]]. Their journey to Imladris is further enhanced by an obese [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]]'s jolly belching and a scene in which [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] eludes being captured by two farmers by performing acrobatics and using the ring to disappear, all while taunting them with poetry. \n\nThe story includes other unfamiliar events, such as when Frodo and [[Galadriel]] have sex near the [[Mirror of Galadriel]]. However, the [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] can hardly be blamed for succumbing to her seduction, as when the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]] first lay eyes on her, [[Legolas]] breaks into a bird-like dance while singing of her beauty and [[Boromir]] throws back his cloak to reveal his muscles. Later on the Fellowship goes on to beat up [[Gimli]] (also known as Lord of the Axe) outside of [[Moria]], and [[Aragorn]] dual-wields both shards of [[Narsil]], with the hilt-less half having a makeshift leather handle. \n\nOther additions include leather-clad beekeepers weaponizing bees at the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], Aragorn killing [[Denethor]], Frodo and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] being burrowed through the walls of [[Mordor]] by a helpful tree, and Frodo being hailed as the \"Lord of the Ring\" after the [[The One Ring|One Ring]] is destroyed.<ref>{{Cite web|articleurl=https://collider.com/lord-of-the-rings-movie-john-boorman/|articlename=The John Boorman 'Lord of the Rings' Movie We Almost Got|author=Patrick Lyon|dated=21 June 2022|accessed=23 October 2024}}</ref> \n\nA copy of the script currently resides in [[Marquette University]]'s Tolkien collection.\n\n==References==\n[[Category:Films]]\n[[Category:Unmade projects]]\n<references />"}}}
