Tolkien]], the products of the Disney company were an especially prominent example of bad style.\n\n\nA remarkable critique of Walt Disney was given by Tolkien in a [[1964]] letter to a fan:\n\n{{blockquote|I recognize [Walt Disney's] talent, but it has always seemed to me hopelessly corrupted. Though in most of the 'pictures' proceeding from his studios there are admirable or charming passages, the effect of all of them to me is disgusting. Some have given me nausea|[[Letter to Miss J.L. Curry]], of 15 July 1964]]}}\n\nIn [[1946]], he rejected suggestions for illustrations by [[Horus Engels]] for the German edition of the ''Hobbit'' as ''\"too Disnified\"'',\n{{blockquote|Bilbo with a dribbling nose, and Gandalf as a figure of vulgar fun rather than the Odinic wanderer that I think of.|[[Letter 107]]}}\n\nMoreover, throughout his life Tolkien had a deep concern and strong opinions about adaptations of his [[legendarium]]. when certain producers became interested in movie adaptations of Tolkien's works, (he had sold the film, stage and merchandise rights of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' to United Artists in 1968), he forbade Disney should ever be involved:\n{{blockquote|It might be advisable [...] to let the Americans do what seems good to them — as long as it was possible [...] to veto anything from or influenced by the Disney studios (for all whose works I have a heartfelt loathing).|[[Letter 13]]}}\n\nIn [[Letter to Jane Dixon|another letter]], Tolkien writes in [[1965]] that neither he nor his publishers ([[Allen and Unwin|George Allen and Unwin]]) intend to give Walt Disney permission to make a film based on his books.<ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 648</ref>\n\n== Tolkien-related Disney products ==\n[[File:The Hobbit Disney.jpg|right|thumb|Cover of the ''The Hobbit Read-Along'']]\n\nNevertheless, Disney's Disneyland and Buena Vista record labels were to release six audio products based on the [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|Rankin/Bass ''The Hobbit'']] and two based on [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|Rankin/Bass ''The Return of the King'']] in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\n*[[1977]]: ''[[The Hobbit: The Complete Original Soundtrack]]''\n*[[1977]]: ''[[The Hobbit (Disneyland Read-Along)]]''\n*[[1977]]: ''[[The Hobbit (Disneyland Storyteller)]]''\n*[[1980]]: ''[[The Return of the King: A Story of the Hobbits]]''\n\nDisney has also in its possession the television network ''ABC'', the original television network  of Rankin/Bass ''The Return of the King'', which acquired it in [[1996]].\n\nMoreover, Disney has released through Fox Searchlight Pictures the biographical film ''[[Tolkien (film)|Tolkien]]'' ([[2019]]), which covers the early years of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] until the [[World War I]].\n\n==External links==\n*[http://2719hyperion.blogspot.com/2009/02/myth-of-walt-disneys-lord-of-rings.html The Myth Of Walt Disney's ''The Lord of the Rings'']\n*{{WP|The Walt Disney Company}}\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Businesses]]\n[[Category:American businesses]]"}}}
