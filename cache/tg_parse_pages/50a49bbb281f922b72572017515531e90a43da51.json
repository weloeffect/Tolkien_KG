From [[Eriador]], he led a thirty-man strong group of Rangers, calling themselves the [[Grey Company]]. With them rode [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]], the sons of [[Elrond]]. In the night between the [[5 March|5th]] and the [[6 March|6th of March]], the Company met Aragorn at [[Dol Baran]]. Halbarad gave his kinsman a standard, which was a gift from [[Arwen]], and a message, summoning him to take the [[Paths of the Dead]].<ref>{{RK|Company}}</ref>\n\nThe Grey Company, now with [[Gimli]] and [[Legolas]] part of [[Aragorn]]'s comitatus, passed through the Paths of the Dead, to the [[Stone of Erech]], over [[Tarlang's Neck]], and on to [[Pelargir]]. He captained a [[Corsair]] ship and they sailed toward [[Harlond in Gondor|Harlond]].<ref name=\"Debate\">{{RK|Debate}}</ref>\n\nOn [[15 March|March 15]] they arrived on the [[Pelennor Fields]] and fought in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields|battle]]. Halbarad unfurled the standard, and it showed the [[White Tree of Gondor|White Tree]] of [[Gondor]] and the signs of [[Elendil]]. He was killed in this battle, and would never return to the North.<ref name=\"Battle\">{{RK|Battle}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThough ''Halbarad'' is not glossed, it is suggested by [[David Salo]] to possibly be a [[Sindarin]] name comprised of the element ''[[barad]]'' (\"tower, great towering building\") and the [[Noldorin]] ''[[hall]]'' (\"exalted, high\").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3563380475.html|articlename=S.

After receiving orders from Elrond to seek out Aragorn in Rohan, Halbarad gathered a large company of Rangers to head south. After suffering short delays in Enedwaith, Halbarad managed to form an alliance of sorts with the Falcon Clan in Dunland. However, Halbarad and his company were soon betrayed and imprisoned by the Falcon Clan. Some of the Rangers with Halbarad managed to escape and soon the Grey Company was free, at the cost of many lives. By the time they reached the borders of Rohan, only 30 of their number remained. At the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], Halbarad sacrifices himself to protect Aragorn from being killed by [[Gothmog]].\n\n'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]:'''\n:Halbarad appears at the beginning of the game at the [[Sarn Ford]].
