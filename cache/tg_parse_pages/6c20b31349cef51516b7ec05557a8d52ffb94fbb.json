Tolkien's fictional world of Middle-earth starts with one magical word: Hobbit. From that word came a sentence, and then a grand story poured forth to create the infamous fantasy realm studied, written about, and enjoyed by millions. The Hobbits of Tolkien examines the origins of Tolkien’s most intriguing race. Insightful commentary by Tolkien scholar David Day explores their shire, their society, and their significance in the epic tales of The Lord of the Rings. Illustrations, charts, and commentary help bring this rich universe to life, making it an invaluable reference book for Tolkien fans of all ages.}}\n\n{{title|italics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hobbits of Tolkien}}\n[[Category:Books by David Day]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]"}}}
