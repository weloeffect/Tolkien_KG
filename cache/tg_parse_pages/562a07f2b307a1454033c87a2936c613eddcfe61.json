Celebrimbor went on to forge another Three Rings alone, with the knowledge he had gained from Annatar. This was completed by around {{SA|1590}}.<ref name=\"SA\" /> These Three were \"unsullied,\" never touched by the hand of Sauron.<ref name=\"Rings\" /> Sauron learned of their making, and desired to possess these Three over all the others.<ref name=\"Rings\" />\n\nWhen Sauron created the One Ring, the Elves who wore the Rings of Power heard his voice, realized they had been deceived, and took off their rings.<ref name=\"Rings\" />\n[[File:Jenny Dolfen - Ringbearers.jpg|thumb|''Ringbearers'' by [[Jenny Dolfen]]]]\nAs the Elves failed him, Sauron [[War of the Elves and Sauron|waged war]] against Eregion in {{SA|1693}}. Celebrimbor immediately sent his three rings away for safekeeping:<ref name=\"SA\" /> he gave Nenya to [[Galadriel]] in [[Lothlórien]], who advised him to send the other two to [[Lindon]], away from Sauron, so he gave Vilya to [[High King of the Noldor|High King]] [[Gil-galad]] and Narya to [[Círdan]].<ref name=\"Rings\" />\n\nSauron succeeded in claiming the Rings of Power. But the Three remained outside his grasp and their whereabouts were seldom revealed. \n\nAfter Sauron's defeat in the [[War of the Last Alliance]] at the end of the [[Second Age]], the [[Keepers of the Three Rings]] were free to wear them. During the [[Third Age]], the Rings were not idle.<ref>{{FR|Council}}, Elrond's words to Gloin</ref> They were used to create enclaves of peace and protection where memory and beauty were preserved from wear and decay.<ref name=\"Rings\" /><ref name=\"L131\" /> \n\nDuring the [[War of the Ring]], [[Frodo Baggins]] found out that Galadriel held Nenya, using it to preserve [[Lothlórien]] from withering, and [[Aragorn]] reprimanded him for revealing this. The other two rings were revealed at the end of the Third Age, after Frodo destroyed [[the One Ring]], and the Dark Lord Sauron was completely overthrown. It transpired that [[Elrond]] had wielded [[Vilya]] and presumably used its powers to keep [[Rivendell]] a haven safe from attack. It was [[Gandalf]] who wielded [[Narya]], given to him by [[Círdan]].<ref>{{UT|Istari}}, p. 389</ref> \n\nWith the destruction of the One Ring on [[25 March]] {{TA|3019}},<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019, March 25, p. 1094</ref> the Three Rings lost their power.<ref name=\"L144\" /><ref name=\"Council\" /><ref>{{RK|Steward}}, p. 971</ref> Not being able to hold back time and preserve the High-elven lore and beauty, their bearers, in the [[Last Riding of the Keepers of the Rings]], left [[Middle-earth]] with the Three Rings on the [[White Ship]] on [[29 September]] {{TA|3021}}.<ref>{{App|Chief}}, entry for the year 3021, September 29, p. 1096</ref><ref>{{RK|Havens}}, pp. 1028-30</ref> The [[Third Age]] ended and the [[Dominion of Men]] began.\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn an early version of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' the Three Rings  were known as [[Kemen]], [[Eär|Ëar]], and [[Menel]]. <ref>excerpt from MS.

In the final film, although [[Gandalf]] can be seen wearing [[Narya]], its significance is never stated.\n\n'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''\n:In the [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (extended edition)|Extended Edition]] of the film, we see Narya on Gandalf's finger as an [[Orcs|Orc]] attempts to cut off his hand in an attempt to claim it for [[Sauron]]. However, Galadriel arrives to rescue Gandalf and vanquishes the Orc in the nick of time. She can be seen wielding Nenya on her finger throughout the scene. During the subsequent battle against the [[Nazgûl]], Vilya can be glimpsed on Elrond's finger.\n\n===Television===\n'''2022: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'', Season One:'''\n:'''Episode 8: ''[[Alloyed]]'':'''\n:In this adaptation, various events found in the books are compressed, rearranged and/or omitted. The Three Rings are forged immediately after the departure of Annatar/[[Sauron]] from Eregion, but the other sixteen Rings of Power are either not discussed or not yet created. In this version, the Three Rings are not presented as the culmination of the [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain|Elven-smiths]]' prior work on rings. The new, magical properties of [[mithril]] made up for the series serve as the main representation of all [[Magic|magical craft]] done by the Elven-smiths.\n:The concept that became the Three Rings was first thought of as a crown to be put upon the [[Gil-Galad|High King Gil-Galad]]'s brow, as they needed something circular to keep the power going in an unbroken round. Yet, since there ultimately was not enough [[mithril]] to do this, the concept changed to something smaller: two [[Rings of Power]]. After Galadriel found out about [[Halbrand]] being Sauron from an [[Lambengolmor|Elven Loremaster]], she tells [[Celebrimbor|Lord Celebrimbor]] that they cannot make two rings, for she says that \"one will only corrupt\" and that \"two will always divide.\" \"With three,\" Celebrimbor responds, \"there is balance.\"\n:However, at the same time, Celebrimbor reveals that the mithril will not bond with the lesser ores, unless they be pure, naming [[gold]] and [[silver]] from [[Valinor]] as an example, but clearly meaning that he needs [[Finrod|Finrod's dagger]]. Galadriel somewhat reluctantly agrees. When the melting is done, Galadriel states that the power that they craft here must be solely for the [[Elves]]. Upon taking the melted dagger out of the furnace and onto a spinning device, Elrond provides the mithril ore that [[Durin IV|Prince Durin IV]] had given him as a token of their friendship. The mithril melts into the dagger, and the liquid is poured into three small steel cups to outline the physical appearance of the future rings. These outlines are then taken by the Elven-smiths, and bent into the shape of the Three Rings. Celebrimbor then binds jewels to each ring. The Ring's names and properties are never mentioned.\n\n===Other===\n'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''\n:Frodo learns from Galadriel that Elrond is the bearer of Vilya.
