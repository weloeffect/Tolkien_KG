This copy was the only one to include [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s complete ''[[Translations from the Elvish]]'', which Bilbo had composed while at [[Rivendell]] during his 'retirement' there.<ref>{{FR|Records}}, pp. 14-15</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe character is described as \"King's Writer\", but the exact meaning of the name is unglossed, although it is clearly [[Sindarin]].
