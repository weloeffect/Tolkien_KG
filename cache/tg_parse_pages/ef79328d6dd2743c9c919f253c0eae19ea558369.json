Although wider to the west, the lake probably did reach the sloping edge of [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]] .

Isildur's sons were killed in that battle, while he attempted to escape using the power of invisibility of [[the One Ring]].  He ran to the Anduin and tried to cross it.  Due to the current he was swept downstream until he reached the western bank near the inflow of the river Gladden.  But the Ring had slipped from Isildur's finger and when he stood up he was seen by Orcs, who laid there to kill any survivors of the ambush, and was slain by their arrows.<ref name=shadow/><ref>{{UT|Gladden}}</ref>\n\nDuring the reign of King [[Calimehtar (King of Gondor)|Calimehtar]] of [[Gondor]] (who died in {{TA|1936|n}}) the [[Éothéod]] were a small people living in the Vale of Anduin; their southern boundary was the Gladden Fields.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, (i) ''The Northmen and the Wainriders''</ref>\n\nDuring the height of [[Angmar]], after {{TA|1356|n}}, some [[Stoors]] from the [[Angle|Angle of Eriador]] passed again the Mountains<ref name=\"TA\"/> and probably about 1410<ref>{{HM|Guide}} p. 164</ref> a band resettled in the Vales.<ref>{{FR|I2}}</ref> It was here, about {{TA|2463|n}}, that the [[Hobbits|hobbit]] [[Déagol]] boated and while fishing retrieved the One Ring; only to be killed by his friend [[Sméagol]].<ref name=\"TA\"/>\n\n[[Borondir]], the messenger of Gondor sent by the Steward [[Cirion]] in {{TA|2510|n}}<ref name=\"TA\"/> to seek aid from the Éothéod (who by then had migrated farther up the Anduin valley), was pursued as he rode north as far as the Gladden Fields.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, (ii) ''The Ride of Eorl''</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|2851}}, after a meeting of the [[White Council]], [[Saruman]] began searching near the Gladden Fields for the One Ring.<ref name=\"TA\"/>  He became alarmed to discover that [[Sauron]]'s servants were also searching the region.<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nFrom [[Old English]] ''glaedene'', \"gladden\" is another name for the \"flag\" or \"[[wikipedia:Iris (plant)|iris]]\".<ref name=\"Nomen\">{{HM|N}}, p. 771</ref> [[Tolkien]] identified the \"gladden\" as the yellow-flowered species ''[[wikipedia:Iris pseudacorus|Iris pseudacorus]]'' growing in streams and marshes, and not the species now usually spelt ''[[wikipedia:gladdon|gladdon]]''.<ref>{{L|297}}</ref>\n\nTolkien suggested to translators to avoid if possible the 'learned' name iris.<ref name=\"Nomen\"/>\n\n==Portrayals in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Gladden Fields.jpg|thumb|250px|The Gladden Fields in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2019: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Gladden Fields form at the bottom of the Gladden Falls, through which waters of the [[Gladden River]] drop from Lake Gladdenmere further upstream.
