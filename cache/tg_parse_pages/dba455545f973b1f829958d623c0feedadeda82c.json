She was said to be akin to [[Yavanna]] the Valië. She is associated with songbirds, and it is said she taught [[nightingales]] how to sing and their music followed her paces. In [[Valinor]], she dwelt in the [[Lórien (Valinor)|Gardens of Lórien]] tending its trees, and she was the most beautiful, wise and skilled in songs of enchantment of all the people of [[Irmo]]. However, she journeyed often to [[Middle-earth]] for she loved the deep shadows of trees and forests.<ref>{{S|IIc}}</ref><ref name=Thingol>{{S|Thingol}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn the dawn of [[Arda]] Melian dwelt in the Gardens of Lórien, and taught the [[nightingales]] how to sing. When the lights of the [[Two Trees of Valinor|Two Trees]] mingled, at noon, she sang in Lórien, and it is said that everything stopped, even the bells and fountains of [[Valimar]], to enjoy her voice.<ref name=Thingol/>\n\nAround the time of the [[Awakening of the Elves]], Melian left Valinor after a warning in a dream.<ref name=dream>{{NM|P1xiii}}</ref> Melian's love for the trees brought her to [[Middle-earth]], filling its silence with her and her birds' voices.<ref name=Thingol/> After [[Oromë]] found the [[Elves]] in [[Cuiviénen]], the [[Valar]] planned to make [[Battle of the Powers|War]] against [[Melkor]]<ref>{{S|Captivity}}</ref> and during their preparations, they sent Melian to Cuiviénen, and then [[Five Guardians|a group]] of great Maiar to guard the Elves. Melian was their leader, the only female spirit among them.<ref name=Five>{{NM|P1xiii}}, pp. 95 & 99</ref>\n[[File:Kip Rasmussen - Melian and Thingol.jpg|thumb|left|''Melian and Thingol'' by [[Kip Rasmussen]]]]\nWhen the [[Eldar]] [[Great March|marched]] into the [[Aman|West]], in the woods of [[Nan Elmoth]], Melian came upon [[Thingol|Elwë Singollo]] of the people of the [[Teleri]]. Elwë was entranced and fell into a swoon at the sight of the Maia Melian, and the two of them stood hand in hand, unable to move or speak for years while the trees grew around them. As a result of his absence, a portion of his followers stayed behind to search for him, while the rest continued on to Valinor under the kingship of [[Olwë]], brother of Elwë.<ref name=Thingol/> \n\nMelian and Thingol recovered and gathered the Elves who stayed behind to look for Elwë, who were named [[Eglath]]. They founded the kingdom of [[Doriath|Eglador]] and ruled as King and Queen of all the Elves in [[Beleriand]]. Melian was the only known [[Ainur|Ainu]] who coupled with one of the [[Children of Ilúvatar]], and thus she begot a child, the daughter named Lúthien, who was the fairest of the Children to have ever lived.<ref name=Thingol/> She married the Man [[Beren|Beren Erchamion]], and as a result, Melian's blood of the Maiar was passed on to both [[Elves]] and [[Men]].<ref name=Quest>{{S|Beren}}</ref>\n\nForeseeing that war was coming to Beleriand, Melian warned her husband Thingol. In turn, Thingol ordered the delving of a strong fortress in their kingdom. This was [[Menegroth]], the Thousand Caves, and they were aided by the Dwarves. With the return of Morgoth and the flight of [[Ungoliant]] from his [[Balrogs]], the dark spider tried to enter into Thingol's domain, but Melian alone repelled Ungoliant and drove her away.\n[[File:Donato Giancola - Beren and Luthien in the Court of Thingol and Melian.jpeg|thumb|''Beren and Lúthien in the Court of Thingol and Melian'' by [[Donato Giancola]]]]\nWhen war with the Great Enemy, [[Morgoth]], [[First Battle|came at last]] to their land, she used her powers to guard and defend it with a protection called ''List Melian'', or \"the [[Girdle of Melian]]\", and their kingdom was known as [[Doriath]], the Land of the Fence. This prevented anyone less powerful than Melian from entering the kingdom.<ref>{{S|Sindar}}</ref> However, with the foresight of a Maia, she predicted that one day someone more powerful would be able to enter. When Beren arrived as foretold, she counselled King Thingol against sending Beren to search for a [[Silmaril]], which would eventually lead to Doriath's ruin. This was one of many instances in which she proved, through her wisdom and powers of foresight, to be wiser than her husband, and an effective queen of her land. The great evil wolf [[Carcharoth]] also passed the Girdle, as fate and the power of the Silmaril let him.<ref name=Quest/>\n\nIn Doriath, she also became a friend and tutor of [[Galadriel]] to whom she taught great lore and wisdom concerning Middle-earth and also the art of [[lembas]]-baking which she knew from her mistress, Yavanna. She eventually questioned Galadriel on how and why the [[Noldor]] had returned, upon which Galadriel told her only some of the story. Therefore she was the first to glean [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë|the truth]], perceiving more than Galadriel was willing to tell, and she warned Thingol against dealing with the [[Sons of Fëanor]].<ref>{{S|Noldor}}</ref> After the departure of Lúthien and Beren, she aided [[Túrin]] and his [[Morwen|mother]] and [[Niënor|sister]]. She provided [[Beleg]] with some way-bread, lembas, for him and the exiled Túrin, showing great favour because never before was lembas given to a Man and seldom was it again. But she also foresaw his doom in his quest for Túrin.<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref> When [[Húrin]], father of [[Túrin]], returned from his captivity in [[Angband]], she was the one to lift the dark spell of Morgoth from him.\n\nThingol's arrogance eventually resulted in his death during a [[battle in the Thousand Caves]]. Melian then departed from the mortal lands,<ref>{{NM|P1iv}}</ref> vanishing to Valinor, where she mourned the loss of her husband in the [[Halls of Mandos]] and her daughter to the unknown fate of the [[Gift of Men]]. In her absence, Doriath was opened to its enemies, which led to its ultimate demise.<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n{{pronounce|Sindarin - Melian.mp3|Gilgamesh}}\n{{pronounce|Quenya - Melyanna.mp3|Gilgamesh}}\n'''Melian''' is [[Sindarin]] for \"Dear gift\", from the ancient form '''''Melyanna''''', being a combination of ''mell'' (\"love\") + ''ann'' (\"gift\").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entries ''[[anna]]'', ''mel-''</ref> She was also called ''Tóril'' meaning \"Queen\".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 389</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | |ELU|y|MEL| |BEO| | | |ELU=[[Thingol|Elu Thingol]]|MEL='''MELIAN'''|BEO=[[House of Bëor]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | |!| | | | | |:| | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | |LUT|~|y|~|BER| | | |LUT=[[Lúthien]]|BER=[[Beren]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | |DIO|y|NIM| | |DIO=[[Dior|Dior Eluchíl]]|NIM=[[Nimloth of Doriath|Nimloth]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree |EAR|y|ELW| |ELD| |ELN|EAR=[[Eärendil]]|ELW=[[Elwing]]|ELD=[[Eluréd]]|ELN=[[Elurín]]}}\n{{familytree | |,|-|^|-|.| | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree |ERD| |ERS| | | | | | | | |ERD=[[Elrond]]|ERS=[[Elros]]}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nShe appeared in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' as ''Tindriel'' or ''Wendelin'' ([[Qenya]]) and in a [[Gnomish]] dictionary as ''Gwendeling'' or ''Gwendhiling''. In a crossed out note, she had with [[Thingol|Tinwelint]] a son, [[Tinfang Warble|Tinfang]], and a daughter, [[Lúthien|Tinúviel]].<ref>{{LT1|IV}}</ref><ref>{{LT1|V}}</ref><ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry \"Wendelin\"</ref>\n\nIn the early [[legendarium]] Melian is defined as a fay, making her somewhat more sinister than in her later appearance. This version of her is presented in '''The Tale of Tinúviel''', Tolkien's first story of Beren and Lúthien, which was written in archaic English and published in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]''. In this work she appears in another later narrative, although her character is portrayed as being far weaker and more frail than Melian's final manifestation. She also appeared under several names, such as '''Gwenniel'''.\n\n[[Vëannë]] and [[Ausir (boy)|Ausir]] argued whether she should be called ''Wendelin'' or ''Gwendeling''. In a slightly later version, the name ''Melian'' appeared. In one variant she was a daughter of [[Irmo|Lórien]]. She was found by [[Thingol|Tinwelint]] while listening to the song of nightingales and ran away with laughter when he tried to touch her hair. Then he fell into a deep slumber, and she kept watch over him while he slept. Later she became his wife and the queen of [[Doriath|Artanor]].<ref>{{LT2|I}}</ref>\n\n[[Christopher Tolkien]] noticed that in this early version her protection was weaker and there was the possibility that enemies would follow the returning Beren and Tinúviel.<ref>{{LT2|In}}, § 2.
