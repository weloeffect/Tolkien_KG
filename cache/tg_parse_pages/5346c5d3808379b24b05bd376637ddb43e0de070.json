Middle-earth: Weapons For A New Age Forming Deadly Characters] (magazine version) and [https://adg.org/perspective/314-middle-earth-weapons-for-a-new-age-forming-deadly-characters/ Middle-earth: Weapons For A New Age Forming Deadly Characters] (article version)</ref> also called the '''Hilt''',<ref name=name/> was a sword hilt forged by [[Morgoth]] and later rediscovered by the [[Men]] of the [[Mordor|Southlands]] in the late [[Second Age]]. It was invented by [[Amazon Studios]] for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'' television series. It is featured in the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power - Season 1|first season]] of the series.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:The Rings of Power (TV series) - Theo.jpg|left|thumb|349x349px|Theo holding the Oric Sigil Hilt.]]\n\nThe Orc Sigil Hilt was said to be forged by Morgoth in the time when the ancestors of the [[Pre-Númenóreans|Southlanders]] swore fealty to him. It was lost for many years until it came into the hands of the Southlander [[Waldreg]], who kept it under a floorboard in his barn. It was eventually found by a young villager named [[Theo]].\n\nTheo found that the Hilt drank the blood of its wielder. Upon being exposed to this blood, the blade shard magically extended to its full length. While searching for supplies in an empty [[Tirharad]], Theo wielded the blade against the [[Orcs|Orc]] [[Vrath]], who recognized the blade and feared it. \n\nUpon inspection by the [[Elves|Elf]] [[Arondir]], the Hilt was revealed to be some sort of key, though the elf was not certain of its significance. Arondir then confided in Theo that the [[Watchtower of Ostirith]] was of sinister origins, and its walls displayed an engraving depicting the blade.\n\nTirharad later fell to an Orc army led by [[Adar (The Rings of Power)|Adar]]. Theo hands the Hilt over to the Orc leader after Adar threatened the life of Theo's mother, [[Bronwyn]]. While a [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] expeditionary force arrived to aid Tirharad, Adar gave the Hilt to Waldreg, who had sworn fealty to him while Adar created and held onto a decoy. \n[[File:The Rings of Power (TV series) - Waldreg uses the hilt.png|thumb|Waldreg using the Orc Sigil Hilt to cause the eruption of Orodruin.]]\n[[Galadriel]] and [[Halbrand]] believed Adar was in possession of the Hilt and pursued him while Waldreg returned the real Hilt to [[Watchtower of Ostirith|Ostirith]]. Extending the blade to its full length with his blood, Waldreg inserted the Hilt into a keyhole-like opening. After the blade sank to the hilt, he turned it, activating a mechanism that opened the dam by the watchtower. This caused lake waters to flow through the tunnels dug by Adar's captives. The waters reached a cavern inside of [[Mount Doom|Orodruin]] and caused it to erupt, leading to the ruin of Tirharad.\n\nAfter serving its purpose, the fate of the Hilt is unknown.\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Concepts from adaptations]]"}}}
