At the laureation I<br>\nfelt like a hobbit would: as is exhibited in<br>\n'The Lord of the Rings', especially by Merry<br>\nand Pippin: great pride and delight in the re-<br>\nception of high honour and title, combined<br>\nwith (and in a way enhanced by) a difficulty<br>\n^in believing that^ it was really happening to me, or was really<br>\ndeserved except by the generosity of my superiors.<br>\nThe words of the Address left me overwhelmed.<br>\nEspecially the words 'making him one of us'.<br>\nI assure you that Edinburgh has gripped me<br>\nfast; and though my 81 years had begun to<br>\nmake me reluctant to travel far, a journey back<br>\nnorth, if opportunity and health allows, will<br>\nnot be reluctant.<br/><br/>\nYours sincerely<br/><br/>\nJ R R Tolkien<br/><br/>}}\n{{title}}\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Letters|Campbell]]"}}}
