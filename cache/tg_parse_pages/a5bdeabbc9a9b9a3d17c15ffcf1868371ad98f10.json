A [[Narn i Chîn Húrin (tale)|song]] tells that his axe smoked in the black blood of the Troll-guard of [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]], the Lord of [[Balrogs]] and the High-captain of Angband until at last he was taken alive by Orcs by Morgoth's command, being bound by Gothmog and dragged to Angband.<ref name=\"Fifth\" />\n\n===Second and Third Ages===\nLater on, [[Sauron]] taught them the little that they were able to learn and increased their intelligence with wickedness.

The Olog-hai only spoke the [[Black Speech]] of [[Barad-dûr]].<ref name=\"Appendix\" />\n\nSince days before memory Trolls settled in the north of the [[Misty Mountains]], in particular near the [[Ettenmoors]]. The realm of [[Angmar]] was founded in their area, and while it lasted (c. {{TA|1300}} – {{TA|1975|n}}) the Trolls' numbers increased, as did their wickedness. After the fall of Angmar, the Trolls retreated to the east of the Misty Mountains, but 300 years before the [[War of the Ring]] they returned to [[Eriador]]. They managed to make dens in the hills as far west as the [[North Downs]] despite the efforts of the [[Rangers of the North]] to watch  the area.\n\nIn the time of [[Arador]], the 14th [[Chieftain of the Dúnedain]], a band of Trolls threatened his house in the woods near the river [[Hoarwell]] north of the [[Trollshaws]].<ref>{{NM|P3xvii}}, note 12, p. 366</ref> In {{TA|2930}}<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2930, p.  1089</ref> hill-trolls captured Arador in the north of Rivendell and killed him.<ref>{{App|Tale}}, fourth paragraph, p. 1057</ref>\n\nIn the [[Third Age]], Sauron bred a new race of Trolls, which were called ''[[Olog-hai]]'' in the Black Speech. In contrast to the older race of Trolls from the First Age the Olog-hai could bear exposure to sunlight as long as they were controlled by the will of Sauron. They were cunning, strong, agile, fierce, harder than stone and spoke little. The Olog-hai were first seen at the end of the Third Age in southern [[Mirkwood]] and in the mountain borders of [[Mordor]].<ref name=\"Appendix\" />\n\n====The Quest for Erebor====\n[[File:Justin Gerard - Bilbo and the Three Trolls.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Bilbo and the Three Trolls'' by [[Justin Gerard]]]]\nIn {{TA|2941}},<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2941, p. 1089</ref> [[Thorin and Company]] encountered [[Bert]], [[Tom]] and [[William|Bill]], three Trolls who had come down from the mountains and eaten a number of [[Men]] equivalent to village and a half, who probably stopped there on their way through the area, as well as sheep.\n\nThe trolls captured [[Bilbo]] and the [[Dwarves]], but [[Gandalf]] returned in time to keep the trolls go on arguing how to cook the Dwarves by impersonating the voices of the Trolls from a place of hiding until the first lights of the morning sun came over the hill and turned the trolls to stone.

[[Patrick H.

[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] used elements of old barbarous mythmaking that Trolls returned to stone when they were not in the dark.<ref name=\"L153\" />\n\nHelen Buckhurst, a friend and colleague of J.R.R. Tolkien presented a paper titled ''Icelandic Folklore'' in [[1926]] in which she stated that Icelandic Trolls in the Sagas and in more recent tales were huge, mishappen and ugly creatures who generally lived in caves in the mountains, were almost always evil, often raided outlying farms at night to take sheep, horses, children, men and women and ate them in their homes in the mountains. She also mentioned that some kinds of Trolls must stay in caves during the day, because the light of the sun turns them to stone.<ref>{{HM|AH}}, p. 80</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 189</ref>\n\nCommenting on the possibility of Trolls having more than one head, [[John D.

Even though the encounter was cut from the final version of the game, Bilbo still mentions the troll to Gandalf when he reunites with [[Thorin and Company]], and [[Kili]] informs Bilbo that Trolls are known to live in the Misty Mountains, and hopes Bilbo didn't encounter any while he was separated.<ref>''The Hobbit (2003 video game)'', \"Over Hill and Under Hill\"</ref>\n:Third-party trainer programs for the PC version allow the boss battle to be reintegrated into the game. Like the three Stone-trolls, the Cave-troll would have been capable of speaking [[Westron]], as shown during its introductory cutscene where it complains about having a toothache. Defeating it would have yielded the Troll Key which, in the final version of the game, instead lays on the floor for Bilbo to take without having to kill any of the creatures that guard it.\n\n'''[[2004]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'':'''\n:Trolls are a playable unit in the game.
