Tolkien]] (according to [[Christopher Tolkien]] \"the first of the [[Legendarium|mythology]]\"<ref name=\"LT\">{{LT2|V}}</ref>{{rp|271}}). It is published in full in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]''.<ref name=\"LT\" />{{rp|267–269}}\n\nThe poem was originally titled '''''The Voyage of Éarendel the Evening Star''''' (with the Old English version ''Scipfæreld Éarendeles Ǽfensteorran'') and was written at Phoenix Farm in [[1914#September|September 1914]], inspired by a line from the ''Crist'' of Cynewulf.<ref name=\"Bio71\">[[Humphrey Carpenter]], ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]'', p. 71</ref><ref name=\"Gedling\">Andrew H. Morton, John Hayes, ''[[Tolkien's Gedling|Tolkien's Gedling - 1914]]''</ref> Under this title Tolkien read the poem at the [[Oxford University|Oxford]] Essay Club in the November of the same year, as referenced in [[Letter 2]]. By the latest revision, written at an unknown date but \"substantially later\" than the first, the newer title was given in its Old English form only. This [[Old English]] title was taken from the poem that inspired it, rendered in modern English as ''The Last Voyage of Eärendel''.<ref name=\"LT\" />{{rp|267}}\n\nIt was the first poem on the subject of [[Eärendil]] and describes his voyage from \"[[Beleriand|Westerland]]\", through \"the darkling [[Valinor|West]]\" and ultimately [[Void|beyond the world]] itself. The fourth verse describes the movements of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]] in a way which anticipates cosmology of the ''[[The Hiding of Valinor]]'' and the ''[[The Tale of the Sun and Moon]]''.\n\n==Poem excerpt==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">Éarendel arose where the shadow flows\nat Ocean's silent brim;\nthrough the mouth of night as a ray of light\nwhere the shores are sheer and dim\nhe launched his bark like a silver spark\nfrom the last and lonely sand;\nthen on sunlit breath of day's fiery death\nhe sailed from Westerland.</poem>\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Bidding of the Minstrel]]\n* [[The Shores of Faëry]]\n* [[The Happy Mariners]]\n* [[Eärendillinwë]]\n* [[Index:Poems by J.R.R.
