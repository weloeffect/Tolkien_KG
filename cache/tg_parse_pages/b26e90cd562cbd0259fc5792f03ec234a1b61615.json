Here shall you fail of all your hopes, and here may you yet die the same death as I.|[[Eöl]] to [[Maeglin]] in ''[[The Silmarillion]]''}}\n\nThe '''Caragdûr''' was a black precipice of rock that was located on the north side of the city of [[Gondolin]].\n\n== History ==\nAfter killing his wife, [[Aredhel]], [[Eöl]] the [[Dark Elf]] was sentenced to be executed by being flung down the Caragdûr. Just before his fall, Eöl cried out to [[Maeglin]], his son, saying that he would die in that same place.<ref>{{S|Maeglin}}</ref> Many years later, during the [[Fall of Gondolin]], Maeglin had laid hands upon [[Idril]] but was forestalled by [[Tuor]]. Tuor fought with Maeglin and cast him far out so that Maeglin's body struck thrice upon the slopes of [[Amon Gwareth]]. Although Maeglin was not said to have died falling from the Caragdûr, he did share the fate of Eöl in a nearby location.<ref>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name is [[Sindarin]], a combination of ''carag'' (\"spike\") and ''[[dûr]]'' (\"dark\").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2585526457.html|articlename=S.
