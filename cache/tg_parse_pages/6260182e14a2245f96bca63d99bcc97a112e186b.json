According to the [[Dwarves]], it was here that the founders of the [[Broadbeams]] and the [[Firebeards]] established the Dwarven cities of [[Nogrod]] and [[Belegost]].\n\nThe two cities were established on the Eastern side of the mountain. A little to the Northeast of Dolmed was Belegost, and a little to the Southeast was Nogrod.\n\nIn {{YT|1497}}, the [[First Battle of Beleriand]] was fought between the [[Elves]] and the forces of [[Morgoth]]. In the end, the Elves were victorious, and the surviving [[Orcs]] fled east toward the Ered Luin. There they were met and annihilated by the Dwarves.\n\nAlmost five hundred years later, the [[battle in the Thousand Caves]] occurred between the [[Elves of Doriath]] and the [[Dwarves of Nogrod]]. In {{FA|503}}, after returning from their victory in [[Menegroth]], the Dwarves were [[Battle of Sarn Athrad|ambushed]] and slaughtered at [[Sarn Athrad]]. After the battle, surviving Dwarves climbed the slopes of Mount Dolmed and were waylaid and slain by [[Ents]].\n\n==Fate==\nSome [[Tolkienists]] such as [[Robert Foster]] and [[Karen Fonstad]] speculate that after the [[War of Wrath]] Dolmed was destroyed when the Ered Luin were broken and the [[Gulf of Lune]] broke through it.<ref>[[Robert Foster]], ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', page 89</ref><ref>[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]], ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'', p. 37</ref>\n\nHowever, [[Ronald Kyrmse|Ronald E.
