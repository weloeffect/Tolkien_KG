He was born in the Netherlands and moved to Canada in [[2005]]. Pierre started drawing in [[2009]] fueled by all things whimsical and musical. He is currently working as a senior traditional animator in Montréal. He started a visual development project based on [[The Lord of the Rings]] to further develop his skills in character design, posing, rendering and more.
