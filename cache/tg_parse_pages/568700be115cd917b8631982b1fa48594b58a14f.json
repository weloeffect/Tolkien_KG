In the battle the House of Ulfang betrayed the sons of Fëanor and attacked their former comrades, though the House of Bór remained faithful to the Fëanorians and fought back. Unfortunately for the Union the treachery of the House of Ulfang resulted to their utter defeat.<ref name=\"s18\"/>\n[[File:Liz Danforth - Ulfang.png|thumb|left|''Ulfang'' by Liz Danforth]]\nAfter the battle Morgoth sent the Easterlings that served him into Hithlum and shut them in, denying them the fertile lands of Beleriand. In Hithlum they enslaved the remaining people of Hador and their women were forced into marriage<ref>{{UT|1}}, p. 24</ref> such as [[Aerin]] who was wife to [[Brodda]] an Easterling chief.<ref>{{CH|4}}, p. 69</ref>\n\nIn {{FA|488}}<ref>{{GA|263}}</ref> the Easterlings and Orcs attacked a group of Elf refugees escaping Hithlum and captured an adolescent [[Tuor]], [[Lorgan]] an Easterling chieftain made him his slave until he escaped three years later.<ref name=\"UT1\">{{UT|1}}</ref><ref>{{S|23}}</ref>\n\nIn {{FA|495}}<ref>{{GA|288}}</ref> Brodda was slain by [[Túrin]] who returned to [[Dor-lómin]] looking for his [[Morwen|mother]] and [[Nienor|sister]].<ref>{{CH|12}}</ref>\n\nThe Easterlings fought for Morgoth in the [[War of Wrath]] but were defeated by the [[Host of the Valar]]. After the war, those that survived fled back over the Ered Luin to [[Eriador]] and beyond.<ref group=\"note\">[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] suggests that the Easterlings of the First Age were related to the Easterlings of the [[Third Age]]; during the deluge of Beleriand they fled to [[Rhûn]] and were the ancestors of the Easterlings as they appear in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''; cf. {{HM|AME}}, p. 40-41. [[Andreas Moehn]] suggests instead that they were ancestors to, or related to the [[Haradrim]], also called \"Swarthy Men\". cf. [http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Men_of_Darkness.html The Men of Darkness]</ref> Some of them became kings of the primitive [[Middle Men|Men]] and they fell under their shadow, for this these Men were neglected by the Valar.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> Some Easterlings related to the faithful folk of Bór still remained in Eriador, and from those people came the most ancient Men that dwelt in the north in the later [[Ages]].<ref name=\"GA174\"/>\n\n==Traits and culture==\nThe Easterlings are described as short and broad, with swart or sallow skin and having dark eyes and hair. Some had greater liking for the [[Dwarves]] of the mountains than for the [[Elves]].<ref name=\"s18\"/> Some of their women were proud and barbaric.<ref>{{UT|1}}, Note 31</ref>\n\nThere were many houses of the Easterlings and they were not always friendly to each other or to outsiders,<ref name=\"GA173\"/> there were two chieftains that had 'the greatest followings and authority' Bór and Ulfang which suggest that they ruled other lesser houses of the Easterlings.<ref name=\"GA174\"/>\n\nThe folk of Bór were described as 'worthy folk and tillers of the earth' which indicate that they were early farmers.<ref name=\"GA174\"/>\n\nIt is seen that they were used to alliterate the names of father and sons/brothers, a custom also seen among the [[House of Beor]].<ref>{{webcite|website=Lalaith|articlename=The Men of Darkness|articleurl=http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Men_of_Darkness.html}}</ref><ref group=\"note\">Other than the name alliteration, a Germanic custom, Andreas Moehn also notes that their names have a strong Germanic flavor.</ref>\n\n{{references|note}}\n[[Category:Easterlings]]\n[[Category:Servants of Melkor]]\n[[Category:Men]]"}}}
