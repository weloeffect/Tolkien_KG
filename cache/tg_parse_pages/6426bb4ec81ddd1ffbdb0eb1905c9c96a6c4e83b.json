The race of Uruks, described as black [[Orcs]] of great strength, first appeared in this battle and were able to sweep across [[Ithilien]] and take [[Osgiliath]].  [[Boromir (Steward of Gondor)|Boromir]] son of [[Denethor I]] was able to defeat this force and clear them from Ithilien, but the city was finally ruined, its great stone-bridge was broken, and no one lived in the city thereafter.  During this brief war Boromir received a [[Morgul-wound]] that shrunk him with pain and caused his premature death but twelve years after his father.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref>\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Conflicts of the Third Age]]"}}}
