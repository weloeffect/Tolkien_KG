They were loosely tied with a red string and on the outer sheet was inscribed in large Lombardic capitals: '''NOTION CLUB PAPERS'''. Later, it was discovered that the papers reported approximately one hundred meetings of a certain discussion group. The meetings took place between c. [[Seventh Age 1980|1980]] and [[Seventh Age 1990|1990]], and Lowdham was one of its members.<ref>{{SD|2b}}</ref>\n\nDuring those meetings, many of the members reported having strange dreams, in which it seemed to them that they travelled through space or time.<ref>{{SD|2c}}</ref><ref>{{SD|2d}}</ref> During a meeting that took place on [[12 June]], [[Seventh Age 1987|1987]], labeled ''Night 67'', the [[Great Storm]] hit [[England]], and strange clouds in the shapes of [[eagles]] hovered above Oxford.<ref>{{SD|2d}}, \"Night 67\"</ref> After that night, [[Alwin Arundel Lowdham]] and [[Wilfrid Trewin Jeremy]], went missing and were only later heard from by a letter where it was found that they were on a journey across the country.<ref>{{SD|2d}}, \"Night 68\"</ref> and returned to Oxford just one day before the next meeting, which took place on [[25 September]], 1987.<ref>{{SD|2d}}, \"Night 69\"</ref>\n{{references}}\n{{notionclub}}\n[[Category:The Notion Club Papers| ]]"}}}
