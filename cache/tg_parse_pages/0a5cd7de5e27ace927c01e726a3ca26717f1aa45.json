This remained the most widely used text of the poem; but after forty years the time came for revision. The new edition pursues the aim of the first – to present an accurate text pleasantly, with sufficient apparatus to enable a reader to understand the rich but difficult language, and so to reach for himself an informed appreciation of the poem. The Text, and the uniquely full glossary, were revised to take account of recent views. The Introduction, Notes, and Linguistic Appendix were largely rewritten; and the book was entirely reset.}}\n\n==Publication history and gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"125px\" heights=\"125px\">\nFile:Sir Gawain and the Green Knight 1925.png|1925 first edition hardcover\nFile:Sir Gawain and the Green Knight 1960.gif|1960 first edition 8th impression\nFile:Sir Gawain and the Green Knight 1967.gif|1967 second edition hardcover\nFile:Sir Gawain and the Green Knight 1968.gif|1968 second edition paperback\n</gallery>\n* The Clarendon Press, hardcover ([[1925]]), pp.&nbsp;240\n** 1925 first edition, 8th impression ([[1960]])\n* The Clarendon Press, hardcover ([[1967]]), pp.&nbsp;262.
