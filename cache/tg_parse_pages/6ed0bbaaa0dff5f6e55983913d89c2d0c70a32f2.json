Subsequently, Blodren entered the service of Morgoth and was released; he was sent in search of Túrin.<ref name=\"Blodren\">{{GA|265}}</ref>\n\nAfterwards, he entered the hidden [[Gaurwaith|company]] in [[Dimbar]], and served Túrin faithfully for two years. After seeing his chance, he betrayed the refuge of [[Beleg]] and Túrin to the [[Orcs]], fulfilling his errand.<ref name=\"Blodren\">{{GA|265}}</ref>\n\nThus their hideout was surrounded and taken. Túrin was captured alive and carried towards [[Angband]]; but Beleg was left for dead among the slain.<ref name=\"Blodren\">{{GA|265}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in the same battle Blodren himself was slain by a chance arrow in the dark.<ref name=\"Blodren\">{{GA|265}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Blodren'' is a [[Mannish]] name with an unknown meaning.<ref name=eldamo>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1000459661.html|articlename=Eas.

He joined Túrin's outlaws for his love of plunder;<ref>{{SM|Q12}}</ref> but after Túrin's encounter with Beleg and subsequent reformation, Blodrin became dissatisfied with the new life where the outlaws would only target Orcs, a \"life in which wounds were more plentiful than booty\". Blodrin betrayed Túrin's hiding place to the Orcs, but was killed by chance by an arrow of his new evil allies.<ref name=q12/>\n\n{{references}}\n{{Gaurwaith}}\n\n[[Category:Easterlings (First Age)]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Gnomes]]"}}}
