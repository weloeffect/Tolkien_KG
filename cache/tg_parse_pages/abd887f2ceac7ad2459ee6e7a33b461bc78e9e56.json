He wrote them as stories. He would sometimes pull a bunch of American letters or reviews towards him and say, 'You know, they're telling now telling me that...' and then he would say some things they'd told him about ''The Lord of the Rings''. He'd say, 'You know, I never thought of that. I thought I was writing it as pure story'. He came gradually to believe some of the things that, well, you were telling him.|George Sayer}}\n\n{{quote|In a 1979 transcription of a discussion on J. R. R. Tolkien and C. S. Lewis, George Sayer tells a remarkable story about Tolkien describing Ireland as 'naturally evil.' He could 'feel,' Sayer relates, 'evil coming up from the earth, from the peat bogs, from the clumps of trees, even from the cliffs, and this evil was only held in check by the great devotion of the southern Irish to their religion.'\"|George Sayer, quoted by [[Marjorie J. Burns]] in ''Perilous Realms''}}\n\n==External links==\n\n*[http://sacnoths.blogspot.se/2009/12/evil-emanating-tolkien-on-ireland.html Evil Emanating (Tolkien on Ireland)] by [[John D.
