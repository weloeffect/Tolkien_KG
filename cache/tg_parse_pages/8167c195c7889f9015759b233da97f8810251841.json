This form of the coastline left only a narrow entrance to the natural haven. The City of the Corsairs was at the easternmost point of the bay of Umbar.<ref name=\"GeneralMap\">[[Christopher Tolkien]], [[General Map of Middle-earth]]</ref>\n\nUmbar was the nearest of the realms of the Southrons to Gondor.<ref name=\"Herbs\" /> It is possible that the realm of Umbar stretched along the coast up to the river [[Harnen]] and along the river Harnen as far its source in the [[Ephel Dúath]] before it became a part of Gondor or after it became an independent realm again, because Westron was still the native tongue in this area at the time of the [[War of the Ring]].<ref name=\"F1\">{{App|Languages}}, first and second paragraph, p. 1127</ref>\n\nIt is possible that Umbar had a climate that was fluctuating between mild winters and very hot and dry summers.<ref>{{HM|AME}}, pp. 182-183</ref><ref group=\"note\">J.R.R. Tolkien wrote on [[General Map of Middle-earth|his son's map of Middle-earth]] for [[Pauline Baynes]] that Umbar is approximately at the latitude of Cyprus and that Minas Tirith is approximately at the latitude of Ravenna, but more to the east near Belgrade. He wrote that these references are so that Pauline Baynes can roughly judge the climate and the fauna and flora for her [[A Map of Middle-earth|map of Middle-earth]]. In addition, he wrote in a [[Letter 294|letter to Charlotte and Denis Plimmer]] that the city of Pelargir is approximately at the latitude of ancient Troy. Cyprus is on the same latidue as Tangiers, a city in northwest Africa at the southern entrance to the Mediterranean Sea.</ref> It is also possible that Umbar had a vegetation of sparse woodlands,<ref>{{HM|AME}}, pp. 184-5</ref> because Umbar seems to have had the natural resources to build a fleet of fifty great ships and smaller vessels beyond count that had attacked Pelargir during the War of the Rings<ref name=\"Debate\">{{RK|Debate}}, p. 875</ref> thirtynine years after Aragorn had burnt a great part of the ships of the Corsairs in the haven of Umbar.<ref name=\"Thorongil\">{{App|Stewards}}, entry for Steward Ecthelion II and entry for Steward Denethor II, Denethor II succeeded his father in TA 2984 four years after Thorongil departed from Gondor after the attack, p. 1055</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Foundation and Númenórean rule===\nIt is possible that the bay of Umbar was discovered by [[Aldarion]], the son of the Númenórean king [[Tar-Meneldur]] when Aldarion scarcely escaped shipwreck in the Harad during a voyage with three ships,<ref>{{UT|Wife}}, in the first quarter of the chapter</ref> which lasted from {{SA|829}} to {{SA|843|n}}.<ref>{{UT|4a}}, ''Chronology'', first paragraph</ref> After [[Sauron]] heard that Aldarion had become a great shipbuilder who sailed his ships to haven far down into the Harad, he chose [[Mordor]] as a stronghold to counter the threat of landings by the Númenoreans.<ref>{{UT|Concerning}}, ninth paragraph</ref>\n\nAfter Sauron was defeated by an alliance of the Númenóreans and the Elves of [[Lindon]] and [[Eriador]] in the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]]<ref>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref> during the reign of Queen [[Tar-Telperiën]]<ref>{{UT|Kings}}, entry X ''Tar-Telperien''</ref> in {{SA|1700}},<ref>{{App|SA}}, entry for the year 1700</ref> he retreated from the coasts of Middle-earth and did not dare to challenge the Númenóreans for a long time.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}, twentyninth paragraph</ref>\n\nUntil the end of the reign of the Númenórean king [[Tar-Minastir]] in {{SA|1869}},<ref>{{UT|Kings}}, entry XI ''Tar-Minastir''</ref> the Númenóreans came to Middle-earth as teachers and friends of the local population.<ref name=\"AfterMinastir\">{{App|Numenor}}, entry after the entry for Tar-Minastir, p. 1036</ref>\n\nApproximately in {{SA|1800|n}} the Númenóreans began to establish dominions on the coasts,<ref>{{App|SA}}, entry for the year ''c.'' 1800, p. 1083</ref> which possibly already included Umbar. It is possible that the son of Tar-Minastir, [[Tar-Ciryatan|Ciryatan]] sailed to Umbar, because he voyaged south before he took the sceptre from his father in {{SA|1869|n}}.<ref>{{UT|Kings}}, entry XII ''Tar-Ciryatan''</ref>\n\nDuring the reign of the Númenórean kings [[Tar-Ciryatan]] and [[Tar-Atanamir]], who were both greedy for wealth, the Númenóreans formed two parties, the party of the [[Faithful]], who remained faithful to the [[Valar]] and maintained their friendship with the [[Elves]] and the party of the [[King's Men]], who followed the policy of the King to oppose the [[Ban of the Valar]] that forbade to sail to [[Aman]] and did not maintain the friendship with the Elves.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}, fifteenth to twentyfourth pargraph</ref> The King's Men sailed far away to the south of Middle-earth and established lordships and strongholds<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}, twentyeighth paragraph</ref> in Umbar, Harad and many other places on the coasts of Middle-earth.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{PM|Second}}, manuscript T4, entry for the years 2000-3000</ref> The Númenóreans in the service of Tar-Ciryatan and Tar-Atanamir oppressed the men of Middle-earth and levied heavy tribute from the men of the coasts and their ships brought back metals and gems from Middle-earth.<ref>{{UT|Kings}}, entry XII ''Tar-Ciryatan'' and entry XIII ''Tar-Atanamir''</ref> It is possible that Umbar was an important point from which tributes and other resources were shipped to Númenor.\n\nAfter the [[Ringwraiths]] had appeared around the year {{SA|2251}}<ref>{{App|SA}}, entry for the year 2251, p. 1083</ref> and after the terror and mastery of Sauron over Men in Middle-earth had grown, Sauron began to attack the strongholds of the Númenóreans on the coasts of Middle-earth,<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}, thirtieth paragraph</ref> \nbut he was not yet able to conquer Umbar.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref>{{PM|Akallabeth}}, §30</ref>\n\nBefore he had married the queen of Númenor [[Tar-Míriel]] and ursurped her throne, the Númenórean king [[Ar-Pharazôn]] had been a leader in the wars of the Númenóreans on the coasts of Middle-earth.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}, thirtysixth paragraph</ref> During this time in Middle-earth he became aware of the strength of the realm of Sauron and of Sauron's hatred against Númenor. After his ursurpation of the throne, Ar-Pharazôn received reports that Sauron was attacking with his might, was pressing down on the cities by the coasts and had openly declared to intend to drive the Númenóreans into the sea and to destroy Númenor, Ar-Pharazôn prepared an army and an armada of ships.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}, thirtynineth and fourtieth paragraph</ref> In {{SA|3261|n}},<ref>{{App|SA}}, p. 1084</ref> Ar-Pharazôn landed with his armada at Umbar, marched with his army for seven days, and commanded Sauron to swear fealty to him.

But unlike these others, Umbar had been settled by the King's Men, who were afterwards called the [[Black Númenóreans]], who hated the Faithful Númenórean survivors of Arnor and Gondor.<ref name=\"UmbarNote\" />\n\nTwo Black Númenórean lords, [[Herumor]] and [[Fuinur]], rose to power among the Haradrim at the end of [[Second Age]]. When Sauron prepared to attack Gondor in the [[War of the Last Alliance]], he also gathered servants from the south, including many Númenóreans, because many of them had sailed east from Númenor so settle on the coasts of Middle-earth in the time when Sauron had lived in Númenór had already served him there and continued to serve him in Middle-earth.<ref name=\"Rings\">{{S|Rings}}</ref> Not all the servants of Sauron were killed at the end of the War of the Last Alliance<ref name=\"Rings\" /> in {{SA|3429|n}}.<ref>{{App|SA}}, entry for the year 3429, p. 1085</ref> Some of them were routed and dispersed and many remembered Sauron in their hearts and hated Arnor and Gondor.<ref name=\"Rings\" /> It is possible that Herumor and Fuinor were from Umbar - their fate is unknown, but it is possible that they died during the [[War of the Last Alliance]].\n\nThe fate of the other settlements of the Númenóreans further south of Umbar is unclear, but it is said that they were 'absorbed', and that no attempt was made to involve them in the wars.

As a result of the capture of Umbar by Gondor, the Black Númenórean lords of Umbar were driven from Umbar and Umbar became a great harbour and fortress of the power of Gondor.<ref name=\"Earnil\" /> Only three years later, in {{TA|936|n}},<ref name=\"Third\" /> King Eärnil was lost at sea with many ships and men in a great storm off Umbar.<ref name=\"Earnil\" />\n\nEärnil's son [[Ciryandil]] continued to build ships.<ref name=\"Earnil\" /> During his reign the Men of the Harad led by the Black Númenórean lords that had been driven from Umbar came with a large force and besieged Umbar.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Ciryandil, p. 1045</ref> In {{TA|1015|n}} Ciryandil was killed in the siege of Umbar.<ref name=\"Third\" />\n\nThe siege of Umbar lasted for many years, but Umbar could not be taken, because of the sea-power of Gondor,<ref name=\"Ciryaher\" /> probably because Umbar could be resupplied and reinforced with ships from Gondor by sea. Ciryandil's son [[Ciryaher]] took enough time to gather an army and a navy, came down by land crossing the river [[Harnen]] and by sea and utterly defeated the Men of the Harad<ref name=\"Ciryaher\" /> in {{TA|1050|n}}.<ref name=\"Third\" /> As a consequence, Ciryaher took the name Hyarmendacil \"South-victor\" and the kings of the Men of the Harad had to acknowledge the overlordsip of Gondor. During his reign the realm of Gondor extended south to the river Harnen and along the coast to the peninsula and haven of Umbar and the sons of the kings of the Harad lived as hostages in the court of king Ciryaher.<ref name=\"Ciryaher\" />\n\nAfter the capture of Umbar by Gondor, the Gondorians built a great white pillar on the highest hill of the headland above the Haven as a monument of the submission of Sauron to the Númenórean king Ar-Pharazôn. The pillar was crowned with a globe of crystal that reflected the rays of the sun and the moon and shone like a bright star that could be seen in clear weather even on the coasts of Gondor or far out upon the western sea.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Eldacar, p. 1047</ref>\n\nWhen King [[Valacar]] of Gondor grew old there was already a rebellion in the southern provinces. Some of the Dúnedain refused to accept his son [[Eldacar]] as their future King, because Eldacar had been born in a foreign country, had been named Vinitharya in a foreign language in his youth and they feared that Eldacar would have a shorter life, because his mother, who came from a foreign country and who they perceived to be of a \"lesser\" race had only had a short life compared to the longer life of the Dúnedain.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Valacar, p. 1046</ref> After the death of King Valacar in {{TA|1432|n}}, a civil war, called the [[Kin-strife]], began in Gondor.<ref name=\"Third\" /> The people of the great havens of Umbar and Pelargir and of the coasts supported the Captain of Ships, [[Castamir]], who was one of those nearest by blood to the crown.<ref name=\"Eldacar\">{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Eldacar, pp. 1046-8</ref> In {{TA|1437|n}},<ref name=\"Third\" /> Castamir deposed Eldacar, who fled to his kinfolk in [[Rhovanion]].<ref name=\"Eldacar\" /> Ten years later, in {{TA|1447|n}},<ref name=\"Third\" /> Eldacar returned from the north with a great army of Dúnedain from the northern parts of the realm and of Northmen, who had been in the service of Gondor and killed Castamir in a great battle at the crossings of the river [[Erui]].

Umbar remained at war with Gondor for many lives of men and was a threat to the coastlands of Gondor and to all traffic on the sea.

It also seems unlikely that Gondor would not have been able to hold Umbar when it still had a fleet and a mighty army, because Umbar could not be taken in the past in the days of King [[Ciryaher]] during a siege by the Men of Harad that lasted for many years, because of the power of the fleet of Gondor.<ref name=\"Ciryaher\" />\n\n===Haradrim rule===\nDuring the reign of Steward Cirion ({{TA|2489}}-{{TA|2567|n}}),<ref>{{App|South}}, ''Ruling Stewards'', year after Boromir and year after Cirion, p. 1039</ref> the Corsairs of Umbar attacked the coasts of Gondor.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, ''The Stewards'', entry for Steward Cirion, p. 1053</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|2746|n}}, the 15th Prince of [[Dol Amroth]] was killed by the Corsairs of Umbar.<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, The House of Dol Amroth, entry for the 15th prince of Dol Amroth</ref>\n\nThe Corsairs spent a long time to prepare a great fleet.

When the Army of the Dead reached Pelargir and came to the ships that were drawn up and to the ships that were anchored all the terrified mariners leaped overboard. Some ships had put off to try to escape down the river or to reach the far shore and many of the smaller craft were burning. Aragorn was able to capture the remaining ships, to man them with troops from [[Lebennin]], the [[Ethir Anduin]] and Lamedon and to row and sail them up the river [[Anduin]] to relief the city of [[Minas Tirith]] from the siege by the troops of Sauron.<ref name=\"Debate\" />\n\nAfter the [[War of the Ring]] the newly crowned king of the [[Reunited Kingdom]], Aragorn, made peace with the peoples of Harad.<ref>{{RK|Steward}}, p. 968</ref> It is possible that king Elessar completely subdued Umbar<ref name=\"Flight\" /> in a war on the far fields of the South with the aid of king [[Éomer]] and the cavalry of the [[Rohan|Mark]].<ref>{{App|Mark}}, Third Line, last paragraph, p. 1071</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n===Politics and rule===\nIt is not known how the Númenórean colony of Umbar was ruled before the Downfall of Númenor when it was a stronghold of the King's Men who were afterwards called the Black Númenóreans.

It is also possible that they did not decide on a new King as the successor of King Ar-Pharazôn, because they did not know if Ar-Pharazôn had survived the invasion of Aman and had achieved his desire of immortality there or had died in Aman or in the Drowning of Númenor.\n\nIt is not known, if [[Herumor]] and [[Fuinur]], who rose to power among the Haradrim in the wide lands south of Mordor,<ref name=\"Rings\" /> were rulers of Umbar.\n\nIn {{TA|1634}}, Angamaitë and Sangahyando were the leaders of the Corsairs of Umbar.<ref name=\"ElendilC\" />\n\nAt the time of the [[War of the Ring]] Umbar was occupied by hostile people whose lords were originally rebel Númenóreans and were currently pirates.<ref name=\"HM|UI\" /> The names and the number of those lords who ruled Umbar during the War of the Rings are not known.\n\n===Language===\nIn the course of the [[Third Age]] Westron had become the native language of nearly all [[Men]] that lived within the borders of the old kingdom of [[Gondor]], including all along the coasts from Umbar northward and inland as far as the [[Ephel Dúath]].
