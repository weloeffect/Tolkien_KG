Tolkien]]'s retirement speech from the [[University of Oxford]], delivered on [[5 June]] [[1959]] in the Merton College Hall.<ref>{{CG|RG}}, p. 1074</ref>\n\nThe valedictory remained unpublished until [[1979]], when the speech was included in ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: Scholar and Storyteller|J.R.R. Tolkien, Scholar and Storyteller: Essays in Memoriam]]''.<ref>Mary Salu, \"Preface\", in ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: Scholar and Storyteller|J.R.R. Tolkien, Scholar and Storyteller: Essays in Memoriam]]''</ref> A revised version was published in ''[[The Monsters and the Critics|The Monsters and the Critics and Other Essays]]'' (1983).\n\nIn his speech Tolkien observes that as he never delivered the expected inaugural address upon assuming the [[Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon|Rawlinson and Bosworth Chair]] 34 years earlier, he was in the awkward position of delivering an inaugural address upon retirement.<ref>[[Michael D.C. Drout]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia: Scholarship and Critical Assessment]], p. 691</ref>\n\n==Excerpt==\n<blockquote>''Fourteen more years have now passed, and I still have nothing special to say. Nothing, that is, of the kind proper to inaugurals -as far as I can judge by those that I have read: the products of minds more sanguine, or more efficient and magisterial than mine.'' <br />\n''The diagnosis of what is wrong, and the confident prescription of the cure; the wide view, the masterly survey; plans and prophecies: these have never been in my line. ''<br />\n''I would always rather try to wring the juice out of a single sentence, or explore the implications of one word than try to sum up a period in a lecture, or pot a poet in a paragraph. And I am afraid that what I would rather do is what I have usually done.''</blockquote>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Lectures by J.R.R. Tolkien]]\n[[Category:Manuscripts by J.R.R.
