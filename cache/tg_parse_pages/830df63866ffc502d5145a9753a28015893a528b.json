Bilbo had already done some exploration of the old hallways using the [[Back Door]] and had stolen a golden cup from the treasure. By this deed and by Bilbo's bold speech Smaug's anger was kindled.\n\nErroneously believing, due to some remarks Bilbo had made during his conversation with Smaug,<ref name=\"Inside\">{{H|Inside}}</ref> that some scheme of the Men of [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]] was the reason for the Dwarves' (and Bilbo's) presence, Smaug flew to Esgaroth to show them who is \"the true [[King under the Mountain]]\".<ref name=\"Inside\">{{H|Inside}}</ref> Smaug's fires burned down the whole town, but the dragon was killed by [[Bard|Bard the Bowman]]. The [[Elves of Mirkwood]] soon learned that Smaug had been killed and thus set forth to claim the treasure, believing there was no one left who had a claim on it. Having heard of the disaster that had struck the befriended men, the Elven host turned aside to offer any help that could be provided. Some day after the Elves had arrived at the [[Long Lake]] a united host of Men and Elves set forth towards Erebor, believing that the Dwarves had been among the first casualties of Smaug's wrath. To their surprise they found Thorin and Company quite alive, the gate to the halls beneath Erebor barred by a wall and themselves treated as foes, coming armed towards the gates.<ref name=\"Fire\">{{H|Fire}}</ref>\n\nFor several reasons Bard, being heir of [[Girion]], Lord of [[Dale]], claimed one twelfth of the treasure: first, he was the dragonslayer and without him, the Dwarves could never have reclaimed their old home. Second, a great deal of Dale's treasure had been robbed by Smaug and thus belonged rightfully to Bard and not the Dwarves. Third, the men of Esgaroth had helped the Dwarves on their journey and now had suffered severely; their whole city burned to the ground and their stocks being destroyed by Smaug, whose anger in the end was only risen by the Dwarves alone. Therefore they demanded compensation and Bard intended to pay it from the part of the treasure he claimed.<ref name=\"Gathering\">{{H|Gathering}}</ref>\n\nYet Thorin rebuked these claims. He would not fulfill any of the conditions as long as an armoured Elven host camped near Erebor. For the Elves did not have any claims on the treasure and Thorin himself had been imprisoned by the Elves.<ref name=\"Gathering\">{{H|Gathering}}</ref>\n\nAs a result, [[Thorin and Company]] were trapped in a bloodless siege, with [[Thranduil]] and Bard hoping to wait him out.<ref name=\"Gathering\">{{H|Gathering}}</ref> However, Thorin had sent messages of his plight to his relatives using as messengers talking [[Ravens]] that lived on the Lonely Mountain. These reached [[Dáin Ironfoot]] of the nearby Iron Hills, and he marched to Erebor with 500 heavily armed [[Dwarves of the Iron Hills]], most of them skilled veterans of the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]].<ref name=\"Thief\">{{H|Thief}}</ref> When Dain's forces arrived, battle was almost joined between the two sides (now ''three'' armies were on the field) but at the last moment [[Gandalf]] intervened between the two and revealed that while they were bickering amongst themselves, the Goblins of the [[Misty Mountains]] and [[Grey Mountains]] under [[Bolg]] were using the opportunity to march against them. They had been incited by Gandalf's earlier slaying of the [[Great Goblin]], but had now mobilized for a full-scale attack after hearing news of the death of the Dragon and the now relatively unguarded treasure hoard.<ref name=Burst>{{H|Burst}}</ref>\n\n===Battle===\nThe three commanders agreed that the Goblins and Wargs were the enemies of all and previous grievances between them were put on hold in face of the greater threat. They arranged their forces on the two spurs of the Mountain that lined the valley leading to the now-sealed off great [[Front Gate|Gate of Erebor]]; the only entrance to the Mountain that remained unblocked (any others had been destroyed by Smaug long before). The 500 Dwarves and 200 or so Lake-men formed up on one spur and over 1000 Elves on the other, while a light rear-guard lined across the mouth of the valley to lure the Goblins between the two spurs of the mountain, and thus destroy them. [[Bilbo Baggins]] tried to sit out the battle on [[Ravenhill]] which was held by the Elves and where Gandalf had also withdrawn to.<ref name=Burst>{{H|Burst}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Joona Kujanen - Battle of Five Armies - Men of Esgaroth.jpg|thumb|left|''Battle of Five Armies: Men of Esgaroth'' by Joona Kujanen.]]\n\nSoon the Goblins and Wargs arrived, and at first the plan worked: they were lured into the choke point and took heavy losses.  However, due to their superior numbers, the allied Free peoples did not hold the advantage long. The second wave was even worse than the first, and due to their sheer number now many Goblins scaled the mountain from the opposite side, and began to attack the arrayed forces from above and behind, as the main wave pressed forward. The battle raged across the Mountain, and then a great noise was heard: Thorin and his twelve Dwarf companions inside the mountain had thrown down a section of the stone wall they had erected across the mouth of the gates, killing many Goblins. Thorin and Company emerged, covered in the best armour and armed with the best weapons in Erebor. Then Thorin cried, \"''To me! To me! Elves and Men! To me! O my kinsfolk!''\", and charged down into the valley to join the battle with many Dwarves and many Men and Elves joining his charge. Thorin advanced through the Goblins' ranks all the way up to the huge Goblins that formed the [[bodyguard of Bolg]], but could not get past them. Also his battle-line was too short, the flanks unprotected and thus his attack soon crumbled, Thorin and many others were cut off and hard beset by [[Bolg|Bolg's]] bodyguard. The battle degenerated into a chaotic close quarters melee, no quarter asked or given.<ref name=Burst>{{H|Burst}}</ref>\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - The Coming of the Eagles.png|thumb|left|250px|\"The Coming of the [[Eagles]]\" by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]\nAs the battle was turning fully against the Free Folk, a large army of [[Eagles|Giant Eagles]] of the Misty Mountains arrived, led by the [[Great Eagle]]. Bilbo was the first to spot their entrance on the scene and began shouting that \"''the Eagles are coming!''\", a shout that was then continued among the other troops of the Free Folk. At this point Bilbo was knocked in the head by a large stone thrown by a Goblin from above on the Mountain, and he was knocked out.<ref name=\"Burst\">{{H|Burst}}</ref> With the support of the Giant Eagles, the Goblins that had scaled Erebor were driven off. The tide was eventually turned, when [[Beorn]] himself arrived at the battle, apparently having heard news that a large army of Goblins were on the move. This time he did not appear in his former shape of a giant Man, but in that of a gigantic Bear. Beorn drove through the Goblin lines, but paused to carry the wounded Thorin out of the battle with his paw. Beorn then returned to the battle with even greater wrath and scattered the [[bodyguard of Bolg]], before ultimately crushing [[Bolg]] himself. The Goblins panicked and scattered, to be picked off by hunting forces from the victors later.<ref name=\"Return\">{{H|Return}}</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\n[[Thorin]] had been mortally wounded on the field, and his nephews [[Fíli]] and [[Kíli]] died defending him as he lay on the ground with shield and body. Thorin died soon after the battle, after he had met Bilbo one last time and had taken back the harsh words he had spoken before.\n\nAfter defeating the Goblins and Wargs, the victors divided the treasure. Bard took [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]'s fourteenth share of the gold and silver in return for the [[Arkenstone]], whereupon he shared his reward with the [[Master of Lake-town]] and gave the Elvenking [[Thranduil]] the emeralds of [[Girion]]. Bilbo, despite having forfeited his share, was offered a rich reward by [[Dáin Ironfoot]] but refused to take more than two small chests of gold and silver.\n\nIt is said that three quarters of the Goblin warriors of the North were killed on that day. The Goblins of the Misty Mountains and the Dwarves both were significantly spent after the battle, and until the [[War of the Ring]], the North remained quiet on both sides.<ref name=\"Return\"/>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn its first versions, the conflict around Erebor ended after the Siege. While Bard and the Elvenking laid siege, Gandalf would arrive and negotiate a peace treaty. The actual Battle, dubbed by [[John D. Rateliff]] the \"Battle of Anduin Vale\", would be on the return journey, in what would later be known as the [[Vales of Anduin]]. There, Goblins and Wargs would waylay Bilbo. The Five Armies in this incarnation were the Goblins, the Wargs, the Woodelves, the Woodmen, and [[Beorn|Beorn Medwed]] leading a troop of bears.<ref name=\"TBo5A\">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[John D. Rateliff]] (ed.), ''[[The History of The Hobbit|The History of The Hobbit: Return to Bag-End]]'', pages 713-4</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''1967: [[The Hobbit (1967 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1967 film)]]:'''\n:The battle is completely omitted. Bilbo kills the dragon, and returns home.<ref name=\"Deitch\">{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=UBnVL1Y2src|articlename=The Hobbit.mp4|dated=5 January 2012|website=YouTube|accessed=10 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n'''1977: [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1977 film)]]:'''\n:The \"Five Armies\" are the Elves, the Men, the Dwarves, the Goblins (and [[Wargs]]) and the Eagles. Bilbo estimates the force of the Men and Elves on 10,000, but this may not be an accurate estimate. The number of Dwarves of [[Thorin and Company]] to have died is seven, but only Thorin and [[Bombur]] are named among the dead. Only [[Glóin]] is shown as having survived the battle.\n\n'''2003: [[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|''The Hobbit'' (2003 video game)]]:'''\n:The battle takes up most of the last chapter. Because Bilbo is the main character, his role in the battle is much expanded. After leaving Thranduil, he has to fight his way to Balin, [[Lianna]], [[Corwin]], Gandalf, Beorn, and ultimately Bolg.\n\n'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''\n:The battle comprises the majority of the third film. The five armies are described as Elves, Men, Dwarves, and two armies of Orcs - one from Dol Guldur and the other from [[Gundabad]].<ref>[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (extended edition)]] Appendices</ref> [[Azog]] acts as commander, rather than [[Bolg]], and set up a signal post on [[Raven Hill]] to coordinate the battle.\n\n:During the battle, Thorin decides to kill Azog in [[Ravenhill]] and is followed by Dwalin, Fili and Kili. Fili is then captured, impaled by Azog and thrown off a tower. Bolg finds [[Tauriel]] and injures her but before he can finish her, Kili arrives to save her but is impaled by Bolg's mace and dies. Legolas, hearing Tauriel's confrontation with Bolg, arrives to fight him before he impales Bolg in the head, killing him. Thorin confronts Azog in a fight to avenge Fili; ultimately, Azog stabs Thorin in the chest, whilst Thorin plunges Orcrist through Azog's chest and stabs him into the ice, killing the Orc. Thorin later apologises to, and makes peace with, Bilbo before dying.\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Conflicts of the Third Age]]\n[[Category:Sieges]]\n[[de:Schlacht der Fünf Heere]]\n[[fr:encyclo:evenements:3a:guerres:bataille des cinq armees]]\n[[fi:Viiden Armeijan Taistelu]]"}}}
