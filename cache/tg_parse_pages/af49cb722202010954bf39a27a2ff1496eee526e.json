But now the complacent inhabitants must keep their eyes open. A ghost haunts the river on foggy nights; the wise bar their doors at sundown. Can you unlock the mystery of The Ghost on the River? \n\nThe haunted riverfront is not the most terrifying of recent events. A young lad, panic stricken, dripping wet, and shivering, collapses on the doorstep of the Fen Worm's Fire Inn, a broken arrow shaft protruding from his left arm. Will you help defeat his enemies in The Survivor? \n\nThe tailor's son disappears after encountering the river ghost and telling the story far and wide. Will you face the darkest evil to search for the young man in The Edain-in-Arthedur? \n\nDespite plentiful rainfall, the trees and crops are withering. A supernatural blight has struck the land. Are you resourceful enough to combat The Shadow on the Banks? \n\nConfront bandits, undead, evil priests, and minions of Sauron as you hunt the Ghosts of the Southern Anduin in these four exciting adventures!  \n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:MERP]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
