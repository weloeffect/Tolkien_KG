Between the Second and the [[First Hall]] - counting from the [[Great Gates|entrance]] of the city - lay the ill-fated [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm]] in the [[First Deep]].  The hall's pillars were notable for being smooth and black, carved like trees, with the boughs holding up the ceiling. \n==History==\nIn {{TA|2994}}, [[Orcs]] joined battle with the [[Dwarves]] of [[Balin's Colony]] in the hall. During the [[Battle of the Second Hall|ensuing brawl,]] [[Lóni]], [[Náli]] and [[Frár]] were killed while the rest of the Colony escaped to the [[Seventh Level]], allowing the Orcs to reclaim the Hall. \n\nIt was the largest of the halls to be encountered by the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] as they traversed Moria from west to east. On their way to the First Hall from the Second Hall, they met [[Durin's Bane]] at the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, and [[Gandalf]] fell into the chasm.<ref>{{FR|II5}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2008: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Second Hall is the centerpiece of the \"Nud-melek\". In the present day its tree-shaped columns stand barren. However, during the flashback set in {{TA|1981}}, the columns and the ceiling are seen to be covered in ornate leaves.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Buildings]]\n[[Category:Moria]]\n[[de:Zweite Halle]]\n[[fi:Toinen sali]]"}}}
