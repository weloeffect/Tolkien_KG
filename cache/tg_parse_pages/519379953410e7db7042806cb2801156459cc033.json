It was released on DVD in [[2003]].\n\n==Plot==\nThree \"[[wikipedia:bogan|Bogans]]\", Greg, Ray and Luke, travel across [[New Zealand]] to meet [[Peter Jackson]]. Their goal is to be cast as extras in ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]''. \n\nThey first travel to [[Wellington]], where Peter Jackson was shooting the film series. After arriving, they decide to purchase ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' books because none of them actually know anything about it. When they open the first page, they discover that [[Hobbit]]s live in holes, which gives them the idea to dig a hole to sleep in. They decided to do this in the yard of Peter Jackson, but later realize that they have the wrong Peter. \n\nIn a strange turn of fate, two of the actors actually ended up in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'': [[Ian Hughes]] played [[Irolas]], and [[Peter Tait]] was [[Shagrat]].\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.nzonscreen.com/title/bogans-2004 ''Bogans'' on the official website of New Zealand]\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!
