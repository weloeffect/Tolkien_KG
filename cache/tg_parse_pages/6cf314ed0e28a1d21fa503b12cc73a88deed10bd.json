Amon Sûl) is the greatest tower-fortress in Arnor and the focus of much of the struggle between Arnor's three successor kingdoms: Arthedain, Cardolan, and Rhudaur. Built by the Faithful Númenórean exiles led by Elendil the Tall in the late Second Age. it rises from the heart of Dúnedain's Northern Kingdom. The royal tower houses the Chief Palantîr (Seeing-stone) of the North and serves as the principal home of Arnor's High Seer. Few fortresses hold such significance; for its size and strength, Amon Sûl is unsurpassed by any other work of northern Dúnedain. Even the Witch-king of Angmar looks to the Tower of Amon Sûl as a great prize, a preeminent symbol of Dúnedain spirit. \n\nWEATHERTOP features: \n\nOver 20 pages of layouts, perspectives, and illustrations \nComplete, multi-level layouts for 13 towers and bastions of the outer works \nDetailed layouts for all 14 levels of the tower, Amon Sûl \n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:MERP]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
