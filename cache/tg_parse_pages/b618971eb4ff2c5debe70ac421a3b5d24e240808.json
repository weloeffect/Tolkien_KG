Also known as Giver of Fruits, she was responsible for all growing things.\n\n==Attributes==\nYavanna was one of the [[Aratar]] and was next to [[Varda]] in reverence. She was the elder \"sister\" of [[Vána]] and the spouse of [[Aulë]]. She was responsible for all things that grew in the earth, from the moss on the rocks to the tallest trees.  \n\nHer usual form was that of a tall woman robed in green. She has also been seen in the form of a tall tree growing from the waters of [[Ulmo]] to the winds of [[Manwë]] spilling golden dew from her branches, which made the barren earth green with corn.<ref name=vala>{{S|IIb}}</ref>  \n\n[[Melian]] of the [[Maiar]] was of her kin.<ref>{{S|Thingol}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Jacek Kopalski - Yavanna's Trees.jpg|thumb|left|''Yavanna's Trees'' by [[:Category:Images by Jacek Kopalski|Jacek Kopalski]]]]\nIn the [[Song of the Ainur]] Yavanna sung of branches of great trees that would receive the rain of [[Manwë]] and [[Ulmo]], and some trees sang to [[Ilúvatar]]. This is said to be the conception of the [[Shepherds of the Trees]]. Her thought also met with Manwë's, setting the arrival of the [[Great Eagles]].<ref name=aule/>\n\nIn the beginning of days, Yavanna planted the first seeds of [[Arda]] and watched over the [[olvar]] and all growing things. As [[Morgoth]] was corrupting her beloved creatures, she contended with him and supported all the plans against him.  After his expulsion from [[Arda]] she planted the seeds that she had long devised and life came to [[Middle-earth]] during the [[Spring of Arda]], although in the beginning no flowers bloomed.<ref name=\"Days\">{{S|Days}}</ref>  When the [[Two Lamps]] were destroyed much of the life on Middle-earth slumbered in the [[Sleep of Yavanna]]<ref>{{S|Sindar}}</ref> that lasted until the rising of the [[Moon]] and the [[Sun]].<ref name=\"Sun\">{{S|Sun}}</ref>\n\nAfter the destruction of the [[Two Lamps]] the Valar withdrew to [[Aman]] and created [[Valinor]].  Upon the green mound of [[Ezellohar]] Yavanna sat and sang while the other Valar sat and listened.  Her song, with the aid of the tears of [[Nienna]] brought forth the [[Two Trees]], her greatest creation, which gave light to the land.  However, Yavanna did not forsake the [[Outer Lands]]; at times she would come there and heal the hurts of Morgoth and urged the other Valar to wage war on him before the [[Awakening of the Elves]].<ref name=\"Days\"/>\n\nAfter [[Ilúvatar]] allowed Aulë's creations, the [[Dwarves]], to survive, Yavanna feared that they would cut down all the trees in [[Middle-earth]]. [[Aulë]], in reply, told her that even [[Elves]] and [[Men]], the true [[Children of Ilúvatar]] would have need of her trees as well.  Yavanna lamented to [[Manwë]], questioning whether anything she had made would be free from the dominion of others.  Manwë brought her concerns before [[Ilúvatar]] in prayer, and Eru did indeed have pity upon Yavanna: He answered her plea by creating the [[Ents]] to protect the trees.<ref name=aule>{{S|Aule}}</ref>\n\nWhen the Elves built [[Tirion]] upon [[Tol Eressëa]] Yavanna fashioned the tree [[Galathilion]], a lesser image of [[Telperion]], for the court beneath the [[Mindon]].<ref>{{S|Princes}}</ref>\n\nAfter the destruction of the Two Trees Yavanna examined their remains and told the other Valar that if she could use the light of the [[Silmarils]] she could heal them. For Yavanna confessed that even as a Valar, who are mighty under Eru, she could never conjure the same light again in this world. [[Fëanor]]<ref>{{S|Darkening}}</ref> refused to give up the Silmarils, although Morgoth had already taken them when he made this decision.   Doing what she and Nienna could, they managed to bring forth one silver flower from Telperion and one golden fruit from [[Laurelin]].  She gave these to her husband Aulë, who fashioned vessels for them and thus created the [[Moon]] and the [[Sun]].<ref name=\"Sun\"/>\n\nFor the [[Men]] who had stood with the Valar in the [[War of Wrath]] the land of [[Andor]] was raised by [[Ossë]], established by Aulë, and enriched by Yavanna. When the [[Edain]] came to this island they created the realm of [[Númenor]].<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> In the later centuries, when the Valar decided to send [[Wizards|emissaries]] to the mortal lands, Yavanna begged the Maia [[Curumo]] to take her servant, [[Aiwendil]], with him.<ref>{{UT|Istari}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Yavanna'' means \"Giver of Fruits\" in [[Quenya]]. The name is a compound of ''[[yávë]]'' (\"fruit\") and ''[[anna]]'' (\"gift\"). Her epithet ''Kementári'' means \"Queen of the Earth\".<ref name=vala/>\n\nHer [[Sindarin]] name appears to be '''''Ivon''''', only attested in the compound ''[[Yavannildi|Ivonwin]]'' (\"Maidens of Yavanna\").<ref group=note>The name ''Ivon'' (variant form ''Ifon'') was also the [[Gnomish]] form of [[Qenya]] ''Yavanna''.
