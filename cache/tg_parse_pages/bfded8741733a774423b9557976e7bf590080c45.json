The made [[Nine Rings|nine for Men]], [[Seven Rings|seven for the Dwarves]], and [[Three Rings|three]] for the tall Elf Kings. Then, the Dark Lord [[Sauron]] learned the craft of Ring-making, and created [[the One Ring]]. \n\nWith the Ring, Sauron conquered most of [[Middle-earth]]. But as he crushed the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]], [[Isildur|Prince Isildur]] lept from the shadows and took the Ring. But he did not destroy it. As he sat admiring the Ring on the banks of [[Anduin]], Orc archers shot him, and the Ring was lost in the river.\n\nSauron recaptured the Nine, and turned their wearers into Ringwraiths. He sent them out to seek the One Ring. The Ring was found, but not by Sauron: [[Déagol]] and [[Sméagol]] were fishing when a fish pulled Deagol out of the water. On the bottom on the river, he found the Ring. Back at shore, Sméagol wished to have it - it was his birthday after all - and killed Deagol. With the Ring, he started thieving and spying. Under the torture of the Ring, he fled into the Mountains, and became the creature [[Gollum]]. The Ring passed out of sight until [[Bilbo Baggins]] stumbled across it one day one his journey with the [[Thorin and Company|dwarves]]. Bilbo Baggins took the Ring back to [[the Shire]], his home.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n! Role !!

Also, the Nine were \"created\" explicitly to seek the One Ring.\n* Isildur is killed as he sits by the river fingering [[the One Ring]], and throws it away as he falls from Orc arrows, rather than it betraying him when he tries to flee.\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings (1978 film) scenes]]"}}}
