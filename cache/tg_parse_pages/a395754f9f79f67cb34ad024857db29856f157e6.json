It was said that he never composed another song afterwards.

The player and Horn later find him drinking his sorrows in the town of [[Snowbourn]]. Gléowine agrees to accompany the player, and they find that the land has been ravaged by the devilry of [[Saruman]]. They return after [[Théoden]] had been healed by [[Gandalf]] and the King takes Gléowine at his side on the ride to the [[Fords of Isen]]. During the [[Battle of Helm's Deep]], Gléowine keeps away from the fighting and later composes a song about the last stand of Théoden's door-warden [[Háma]]. Gléowine again journeys by the King's side to [[Minas Tirith|Mundburg]] and sees the King's death at the hands of the [[Witch-king]] first-hand. \n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gleowine}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:Minstrels]]\n[[Category:Rohirrim]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n\n[[de:Gléowine]]\n[[fi:Gléowine]]"}}}
