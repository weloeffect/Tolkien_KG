Tolkien - Bilbo's contract tengwar.jpg|thumb|The second page of Thorin's letter in [[tengwar]].]]\n\n'''Thorin's letter''',<ref name=Thief/> was a note from [[Thorin and Company]] to [[Bilbo Baggins]].<ref name=Mutton/>\n\n== History ==\n[[Thorin]] [[Oakenshield]] wrote the message after the unexpected party in {{TA|2941}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> and left it on Bilbo's mantelpiece just under the clock. The next morning, having not dusted the mantelpiece, Bilbo did not see the letter until [[Gandalf]] walked in and pointed it out.\n\nThe letter began with a greeting to \"Burglar Bilbo\" and thanks for his hospitality and offer to help. A short list of contract terms were then laid out, promising Bilbo one fourteenth of the profits (if any), with travelling and funeral expenses covered. The letter then explained that the [[Thorin and Company|dwarves]] had gone ahead to make preparations and that Bilbo was expected at the Green Dragon Inn in [[Bywater]] at eleven. A final sentence emphasized that Thorin expected him to arrive on time.\n\nBy the time the hobbit had finished reading the note he had, as the wizard remarked, just ten minutes to get from [[Bag End]] to the [[Green Dragon]] in order to be on-time for the start of the quest to the [[Lonely Mountain]]. Bilbo ran as fast as he could and made it on the stroke of eleven.<ref name=Mutton>{{H|Mutton}}</ref>\n\nEventually Bilbo brought out Thorin's letter in the camp of the [[Thranduil|Elvenking]] and [[Bard]] in the valley before the Lonely Mountain. Bilbo had kept the crumpled and much folded missive in his jacket pocket throughout his adventures and used it to explain his interest in the matters at hand.<ref name=Thief>{{H|Thief}}</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nIn the manuscript for ''[[The Hobbit]]'' Thorin's letter, referred to as \"Bilbo's contract\" by [[John D. Rateliff]], was the same as the one published, with the exception that the rendezvous point was the [[Old Mill|Great Mill]]. However, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] also produced a handwritten version of the letter in [[tengwar]], mentioned in his [[Letter 25|letter to ''The Observer'']] in February [[1938]], which proved to be too difficult to reproduce for publication. It was finally included, with a transcript by [[Taum Santoski]], in Rateliff's ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]'' as the frontispiece to Part Two: ''Return to Bag-End''. The Tengwar text was semi-phonetical.<ref>{{HH|Contract}}, pp. 105-7</ref>\n\n== Portrayal in adaptations ==\n===Thorin's letter in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Hobbit - An Unexpected Journey - Bilbo Baggins in Bag End.jpg|Bilbo's contract in ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]''\nFile:Weta Workshop - Bilbo's contract.jpg|Bilbo's contract by [[Weta Workshop]]\n</gallery>\n'''[[2012]]: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''\n:Unlike Tolkien's version, where Bilbo gets the message first after the departure of the dwarves, [[Peter Jackson]]'s film version makes Bilbo receive the contract directly from Thorin and Company while still at [[Bag End]].
