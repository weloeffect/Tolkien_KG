He came too late to the battle field however, and was only able to bring back the fallen [[Hador]]. He was then stationed at [[Eithel Sirion]], and was there when Húrin took command. But he tired of war, and returned to his woods, at which point he accidentally severed his right foot. He remarked to Túrin that, ''\"a man that flies from his fear may find that he has only taken a short cut to meet it\"''. The remaining part of his leg had shrunken from lack of use.<ref name=\"Sador\" />\n\nOne of Sador's talents was wood-working. Sador became a \"house-man in the service of Húrin\"; in spite of being a simple servant, Sador was wise and shared with young Túrin many insights about the nature of [[Men]], [[Elves]], and fate.<ref name=\"Sador\">{{CH|1}}, p. 41-44</ref>\n\nSador worked in the outbuildings, fixing things around the house which were usually of little importance. He was Túrin's best friend during his youth, and the boy would often help Sador by fetching materials and tools to spare him from walking. When Túrin brought him gifts he \"found\" lying around, Sador would tell the boy to return them, and taught him he shouldn't steal even if it is to give. Sador enjoyed Túrin's company and would often carve for him figures of men and beasts, although Túrin enjoyed Sador's stories the most.\n\nOn Túrin's birthday, his father gave him an [[Elves|Elven]] knife of great worth. Túrin pitied Sador and decided to give the gift to him. Sador accepted the gift as it would be rude not to, but he knew he would be unable to repay Túrin for such a gift.\n\nTúrin's mother, [[Morwen]], did not care for Sador and called him \"self-maimed by his own want of skill, and he is slow with his tasks, for he spends much time on trifles unbidden.\" But Túrin noted that his act of generosity resulted in Sador being treated more kindly. At this time Sador set out to carve a great throne for the hall of Húrin.<ref>{{CH|1}}, p. 48-50</ref>\n\nAfter Túrin departed, Sador remained in the house of [[Morwen]], though he wished he may have joined the battle to die a valiant death. Upon Túrin's return from [[Nargothrond]] many years later, Sador joined in the rebellion against the [[Easterlings]] who had taken over the land. He was then wounded and perished.<ref>{{CH|12}}, p. 189</ref>\n\n==Quotes==\n{{blockquote|Give with a free hand, but give only your own.<ref name=Sador />}}\n\n{{blockquote|A man who flies from his fear may find he has only taken a shortcut to meet it.<ref name=Sador />}}\n\n{{blockquote|False hopes are more dangerous than fears.<ref name=Departure>{{CH|4}}, pp. 74-75</ref>}}\n\n{{blockquote|So most men teach, and few men learn.<ref name=Departure />}}\n\n{{blockquote|Let the unseen days be.

[[1969]] text, [[Tolkien]] intended to transform the character of Sador (whose name was changed to '''''Sadog'''''<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, pp. 309, 327, note 52</ref>) into one of the [[Drúedain]]. Some of the Drúedain (also called Drûg) lived in the household of Húrin, for he had dwelt among the [[House of Haleth|Folk of Haleth]] in his youth (where most of the Drúedain lived in the [[First Age]]).<ref>{{UT|12c}}, \"8\"</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Children of Húrin]]\n[[Category:Drúedain of Beleriand]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Folk of Hador]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]"}}}
