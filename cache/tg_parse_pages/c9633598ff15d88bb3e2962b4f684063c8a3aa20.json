Tolkien]] a newspaper article which suggested that Tolkien had been influenced by Cabell:<ref>Arne Zettersten, ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien's Double Worlds and Creative Process]]'', p. 199</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|Tolkien wrote back to me and denied forcefully that this was true. The next time we met he took up the matter again and maintained that he knew Cabell well, but that he had read only one of his books and that it was 'quite boring'.}}\n\n[[John D. Rateliff]] has proposed that the book, which Tolkien is referring to in Zettersten's reminiscence, is Cabell's ''[[Wikipedia:Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice|Jurgen]]'' ([[1919]]).<ref>{{webcite|author=[[john D.

Anderson]] includes Cabell's short story \"The Thin Queen of Elfhame\". Anderson writes that \"Cabell represents a very different type of fantasy from Tolkien\", the former often including irony in his writings.<ref>[[Douglas A.
