Gordon]] and [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], others are folk songs from various traditions. It is perhaps the rarest and most difficult to find Tolkien related book, as it was printed privately in [[1936]] and has never been reprinted since.\n\nThe verses are written in a number of languages, including Modern English, [[Middle English]], [[Old English]], Icelandic, Latin, and [[Gothic]].\n\nIn [[2023]], a revised and edited transcript of the book was made available by [[Ronald Kyrmse]] (see the bottom of the page), with corrections based on ''[[The Road to Middle-earth]]'' ([[1982]]).<ref>{{HM|A}}E.V. Gordon, J.R.R. Tolkien, Ronald Kyrmse (ed.) ''Songs for the Philologists''</ref>\n\n==Physical appearance==\n''Songs for the Philologists'' is privately printed in the Department of English at University College, London, in 1936. It is the first and only edition, 8vo (214mm.), pp. iv, 30, [2]; orig. printed pale blue wrappers, saddle-stitched; with staples.\n\nThe text is in both English and Anglo-Saxon and is printed in both Roman and Anglo-Saxon types. On the verso of the title: \"Printed by G. Tillotson, A.H. Smith, B. Pattison and other members of the English Department, University College, London.\" SUNY-Buffalo and Oxford University only in OCLC.<ref>Collier, P. \"[https://tolkienlibrary.com/reviews/songsforthephilologists.htm Songs for the Philologists (20.02.05 by Pieter Collier)]\" (accessed 14 September 2022)</ref>\n\n==Background==\nDuring his tenure at [[Leeds University]], Tolkien formed, with Gordon, a society known as the \"[[Viking Club]]\" devoted to reading Old Norse sagas and drinking beer. Sometime in 1934, Tolkien and Gordon prepared a set of typescripts of verses, including original compositions of their own devising as well as traditional songs in Old and Modern English and other languages. The typescripts were distributed to students from the club for their amusement.<ref>{{HM|A}}Carpenter, H. [1977] ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]'' pp. 112</ref>\n\nAmong those who received copies was former student A.H. Smith, then of University College London, who used his copies of the typescripts as a printing exercise for his own students in 1936. An unknown (but undoubtedly small) number of pamphlets were hand-set and privately printed by students on a replica wooden common press (not unlike the replica press located on the 2nd floor of U.Va.’s Alderman Library in the Stettinius Gallery). Smith realized, after the pamphlets had already been printed, that he had not obtained permission from Tolkien and Gordon, so the pamphlet was never distributed. Instead, copies were kept in storage at the pressrooms on Gower Street.\n\nThe building was bombed in WWII. The pressrooms burned, along with the presses and any stock stored on the premises. The only copies of the pamphlet that survived were those that had been taken by the students who printed it. It is not known how many copies survived, though H. Winifred Husbands, one of the students involved in the printing, has estimated the number to be no less than thirteen.<ref>Schwartzburg, M. \"[https://smallnotes.library.virginia.edu/2014/08/14/tolkien-black-swan/ This Just In: A Tolkien Black Swan]\" (accessed 14 September 2022)</ref>\n\n==Tolkien's songs==\n[[Image:Songs for the Philologists page 1.jpeg|thumb|250px|''The Root of the Boot'' as printed in the book]]\nOf the 30 poems and songs in the collection, 13 were contributed by Tolkien:\n<br>(\"#\" indicates the order of appearance)\n\n# ''[[From One to Five]]'' #8 — tune: ''Three Wise Men of Gotham''.\n# ''[[Syx Mynet]]'' #9 — in [[Old English]], tune: ''I Love Sixpence''.\n# ''[[Ruddoc Hana]]'' #10 — in Old English, tune: ''Who Killed Cock Robin?''\n# ''[[Ides Ælfscýne]]'' #12 — in Old English, tune: ''Daddy Neptune'', translated as \"Elf-fair Lady\" by T.
