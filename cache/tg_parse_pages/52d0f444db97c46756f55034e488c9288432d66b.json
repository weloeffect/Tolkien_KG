After they were fed, Bilbo began to clear away the plates and glasses but when [[Thorin]] declared, \"Now to clear up!\" all of the other dwarves jumped up, piled all the dishes most precariously, and carried them into the kitchen. Bilbo nearly squeaked with fright, believing that his dishes might be ruined. The amused dwarves sang this song that described all of the kitchen horrors that seemed about to happen, but of course none of them did.<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref>\n\n==Text==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nChip the glasses and crack the plates!\nBlunt the knives and bend the forks!\nThat's what Bilbo Baggins hates—\nSmash the bottles and burn the corks!\n\nCut the cloth and tread on the fat! \nPour the milk on the pantry floor!\nLeave the bones on the bedroom mat!\nSplash the wine on every door!\n\nDump the crocks in a boiling bowl;\nPound them up with a thumping pole;\nAnd when you’ve finished if any are whole,\nSend them down the hall to roll!\n\nThat's what Bilbo Baggins hates!\nSo, carefully! carefully with the plates!\n</poem>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Hobbit - An Unexpected Journey - That's what Bilbo Baggins hates!.jpg|thumb|250px|The scene at the conclusion of the singing of \"Chip the glasses and crack the plates\" in ''The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey'']]\n'''1977: [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1977 film)]]:'''\n:\"Chip the glasses and crack the plates\" was adapted as \"[[That's What Bilbo Baggins Hates]]\" and was included in ''[[The Hobbit: The Complete Original Soundtrack]]''.\n\n'''1985: [[The Hobbit (1985 television film)|''The Hobbit'' (1985 television film)]]'''\n:The song is sang by the gnomes as in the book, with minor differences from the version written in the book translation that the film is based upon.
