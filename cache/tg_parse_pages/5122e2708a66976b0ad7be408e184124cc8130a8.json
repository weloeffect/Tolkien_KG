Gamli was invented for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'' by [[Amazon Studios]], where he was portrayed by an unknown actor.\n\n==History==\nGamli and his sister [[Gerda]] were born to Durin IV and Disa in the twenty years since [[Elrond]] last visited [[Khazad-dûm]]. Gamli and Gerda are playing with one another when Elrond visits Durin's chambers.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'', \"[[Adrift]]\"</ref> While [[Disa]] spoke to Elrond, Gamli and Gerda sung and punched each other. When Disa told them to stop, they claimed they were playing the 'Knocking Game'. Disa, again, told them to stop.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'', \"[[The Great Wave]]\"</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Dwarves from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) characters]]"}}}
