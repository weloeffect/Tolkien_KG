[[Christopher Tolkien]] notes in the preface to the Annals of Aman: \"The dates of the annals of the Years of the Trees were changed very frequently – in some cases there are as many as six substitutions – and I give only the final form.\" Thus, one of the two dates seems to be a remnant of an earlier draft.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:First Age years]]\n[[Category:Years of the Trees]]"}}}
