Tolkien]], originally included in the unfinished novel ''[[The Lost Road]]'' (published in ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]''). Although Tolkien did not provide an official title, in the narrative it is sung by a maiden named [[Fíriel (The Lost Road)|Fíriel]], therefore it is universally referred to as ''Fíriel's song''.\n\n== History ==\nWithin the narrative, only the two first lines are given. They are sung by Fíriel, a maiden of [[Elendil]]'s household and the daughter of [[Orontor]]. While Elendil and his son [[Herendil]] were approaching their house, they heard Fíriel until her voice fell in the question \"''O Ilúvatar, give me in that day beyond the end, when my Sun faileth?''\" Then Elendil said \"''E man antaváro? What will he give indeed?''\" Herendil complained, saying that she should not be singing such things, as people in Númenor were now singing that [[Melko]] would come back and give them the Sun forever, but his father despised those words.<ref name=Firiel>{{LR|P1III2}}</ref>{{rp|62–63}}\n\nThe first manuscript of the narrative gives the whole poem and the English translation, while in the revision Tolkien decided to omit most parts and leave only the two first lines.<ref name=Firiel />{{rp|71–72}} [[Helge Fauskanger]] explains that the language of this song could be called \"near-LotR-style\" Quenya, or late \"Qenya\".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/firiel.htm|articlename=Fíriel's song|dated=|website=[[Ardalambion]]|accessed=29 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n== The poem ==\n:'''Quenya text'''\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nIlu Ilúvatar en kárẹ eldain a fírimoin\nar antaróta mannar Valion: númessier.\nToi aina, mána, meldielto - enga morion:\ntalantie.
