A new edition, with a new cover, was released in 2003.\n\n==From the publisher (2003 edition)==\n\nA revised and expanded reissue containing over 1,200 brain-teasing questions on the legendary works of J.R.R. Tolkien, published to coincide with the release of the third and final The Lord of The Rings movie. How many Hobbits joined the Fellowship of the Ring? What colour is the Orcs' skin? Why did Gandalf have difficulty in opening the West-door of Khazad-dum? Who betrayed Berien and Luthien to Thingol? What was Farmer Giles' full name? The worlds of J.R.R. Tolkien, from the saga of Middle-earth to a brief visit to Wootton Major, are so rich and varied that they inspire legions of followers of different ages. This peerless revised and expanded quiz book offers over 1,200 questions and answers, including easy starter questions and more difficult tie-breakers, to test the range and depth of your knowledge. And whereas every right answer will confirm your mastery over your subject, every wrong answer will be a learning experience all of its own!\n\n==External links==\n\n*[http://tolkienlibrary.com/press/1069-interview-andrew-murray-author-The-Tolkien-Quiz-Book.php Interview with Andrew Murray author of ''The Tolkien Quiz Book''] at [[Tolkien Library]]\n\n{{title|italics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tolkien Quiz Book (by Murray)}}\n[[Category:Quiz books]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
