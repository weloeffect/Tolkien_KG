Note that sometimes it is written with a three (3) when the font is not available. \n\nThe Middle English sound ''Ȝ'' was derived from [[Old English]] ''g''. It was a sound that doesn't exist any more in English language since it is now assimilated with ''y'' or isn't pronounced at all.\n\n==Ȝ in Elvish==\n===Primitive Quendian===\nTolkien used ''Ȝ'' in ''[[The Etymologies]]'' to describe the sound ''gh''. The ''Ȝ'' is seen most often in [[Primitive Quendian]] [[Sundocarmë|Root]]s such as MAȜ, KUȜ, TEȜ. This sound however was assimilated to other sounds. \n\nBefore unvoiced consonants it would evolve into ''ch'': ''maȝtâ'' (MAȜ) evolved to [[Common Eldarin]] ''machtâ''.\n\nFinal, after ''u'', it would evolve into ''w'': ''kuȝ'' (KUȜ) > ''kuw''\n\n===Later Ȝ===\nThe sound ''gh'' would return once more in [[Elvish]]. Like in the case of English, Primitive Quendian ''g'' was simplified to ''gh'' in [[Quenya]] (and [[Sindarin]], in most cases). For example the word ''galadâ'' \"tree\" evolved into *''ghaldâ/ȝaldâ'' in the Quenyan branch.\n\nOnce more, the ''gh'' sound could be heard in Elvish, and it survived long enough to be written in [[Sarati]] before disappearing again. The word ''[[alda]]'' was still spelt ''ȝalda'' with the letter <em style=\"font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tirion Sarati'\">'</em> representing ''gh''. It was known by tradition among the [[loremasters]]<ref>[[Vinyar Tengwar 39]] p. 7</ref>\n\nWhen ''gh'' was lost once more, the Sarat <em style=\"font: normal 1.7em/1.5em 'Tirion Sarati'\">'</em> was eventually used for a carrier. It was inherited as a carrier in the [[Tengwar]] and later was replaced by the letter [[Anna]], to indicate an assuming “vanished” ''gh'' wherever words begun with a vowel.\n\nThis usage tried to explain the relation of words between Noldorin words starting with a vowel where Telerin had ''g-'' (cf. Quenya ''[[alda]]'' vs. [[Telerin]] ''galla''), but did not explain all the cases of words without an initial consonant (''alca'', according to this, should be spelled *{{tg|mode=smith|hDjaE}} that time, although it had never been ''**galka'' before).\n\n==Other languages==\nNote that in other languages, like [[Orkish]], Tolkien wrote this sound as ''gh''.\n\nIn [[Tengwar]], ''ȝ/gh'' is written with the letter [[Anca]] or Unquë.\n\n==External links==\n* {{WP|Yogh}}\n*''[http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/qevolution.pdf The Evolution of Quenya]'' by [[Helge Fauskanger]] and Vincente Velasco\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Linguistic terms]]"}}}
