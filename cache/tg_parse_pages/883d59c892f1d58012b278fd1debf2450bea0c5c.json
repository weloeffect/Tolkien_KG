This scene was not included in the theatrical release of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n[[Aragorn]] wanders the [[Golden Hall]] at night. He walks past [[Pippin]] who, after tossing and turning, awakes. \n\nAragorn comes upon [[Éowyn]] asleep, and cover her with a blanket. She wakes and tells him of her dream in which she saw ''\"a great wave, climbing over green lands and above the hills\"'', upon which she was standing. Aragorn comforts her in her distress, before she falls asleep again. \n\n== Differences ==\nThe dream Éowyn speaks to Aragorn of in this scene is had by [[Faramir]] in the books. This occurs in the chapter \"[[The Steward and the King]]\", after his time in the [[Houses of Healing]]. While Éowyn and he stand together watching [[Minas Tirith]] at the time of the destruction of the ring, he speaks to her of Númenor, and \"''of the great dark wave climbing over the green lands and above the hills''\". He tells her he often dreams of it.<ref>{{RK|Steward}}, p. 962</ref> \n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King scenes|07]]"}}}
