Literally, it means \"the dinhorde, the yelling horde\", and is a descriptive term referring to the loud and barbarous speech of the Orcs.<ref name=UT>{{UT|Tuor}}, p. 39</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe first part, ''glam'', means \"barbaric speech\", and is an expansion of ''[[lam]]'' (\"tongue, language\"). An individual within the group is referred to as a ''glamog''<ref>{{WJ|AC}}, p. 391</ref>. The second element, ''[[hoth]]'' is a common suffix to denote a collection of people, usually used negatively.<ref>{{S|Appendix}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n*''[[Gurth an Glamhoth!|Gurth an '''Glamhoth'''!]]'' = \"Death to the Orcs!\"\n*''[[Glamdring|'''Glam'''dring]]'' = \"Foe-hammer\"\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nThis word has a long history in Tolkien's mind, but always had evil connotations. In its earliest appearances, it meant \"fierce hate\",<ref>{{PE|15}}, \"Namelist to ''The Fall of Gondolin''\", page 25</ref> but later, its meaning became \"shouting, confused noise\", and became (poetically) associated with [[Orcs]].\n\n==Inspiration==\nThroughout history, populations have always considered the languages of other peoples inferior, or uncouth to the ears. The term [[Wikipedia:Barbarian|\"Barbarian\"]] originally meant \"brabbler\". Similarly, Germany is called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_for_Germany \"Land of the Mute\"], \"land of those who do not speak our tongue\" in some Slavic countries. A similar pattern is found in [[Adûnaic]], where the word for \"shout\" (''rûkh'') is related to the words for \"Orc\", ''[[uruk]]''. \n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Orcs]]\n[[Category:Sindarin demonyms]]\n[[de:Orks#Andere Namen]]\n[[fi:Glamhoth]]"}}}
