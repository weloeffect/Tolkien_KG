Tolkien''''' is a collection of articles about [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and the role of women in his writings.\n\n==From the publisher==\n{{blockquote|'Perilous and Fair: Women in J. R. R. Tolkien's Work and Life', the newest title from Mythopoeic Press has been published. Edited by Mythlore editor Janet Brennan Croft and MythPress editor Leslie A. Donovan, this collection contains seven articles first published between 1984 and 2007 (many in [[Mythlore]]) as well as seven brand new articles the topic. Among others, new articles cover such topics as Tolkien's support of women in higher education, relationships between '[[The Lord of the Rings]]' and Victorian boys' books, and critical response of women readers through fan fiction. Other articles, both new and classic, examine specific female characters, including Nienna, Éowyn, Lúthien, and Galadriel. Through this collection, the editors and authors aim to remedy perceptions that Tolkien has nothing useful or modern to say about women and to recognize that women enact essential, rather than merely supportive, roles in Tolkien's Middle-earth fiction and in his life.}}\n\n==Contents==\n\n*[[Janet Brennan Croft]] and Leslie A.
