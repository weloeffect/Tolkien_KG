During the [[War of the Ring]] Grimbeorn visits the camp of Vindurhal in the [[High Pass]] of the [[Misty Mountains]], but returns home soon after. After the destruction of [[The One Ring]], Grimbeorn is visited by [[Gandalf]], [[Legolas]] and the player on their journey back to [[Gondor]] after a brief visit to the northern lands. Already annoyed by a number of visitors, Grimbeorn is then forced to host a much larger procession when [[Elrond]] and much of his house stay at his lodge on their way to [[Minas Tirith]] for [[Arwen]]'s wedding.\n\n{{References}}\n{{Seq-start}}\n{{Seq-head\n|race=[[Northmen]]\n|house=[[Beornings]]\n|born=After {{TA|2941}}\n|died=After {{TA|3018}}\n}}\n{{seq\n|prev=[[Beorn]]\n|list=2nd Chieftain of the [[Beornings]]\n|dates=Around {{TA|3018}}\n|next=Unknown\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n[[Category:Beornings]]\n[[Category:Rulers in Middle-earth]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n\n[[de:Grimbeorn]]\n[[fi:Grimbeorn]]"}}}
