''[[amon|emyn]]''). One historian of Gondor claimed that ''Arnen'' was likely a word invented by the Númenórean settlers of Gondor, intended to resemble an Elvish tongue (but wrongly mixing [[Quenya]] ''[[ar|ar-]]'' \"beside\" with [[Sindarin]] ''[[nen]]'' \"water\"). Other historians derived ''Arnen'' from an unattested [[pre-Númenórean]] word ''arn-'' (\"rock\"), although this was based on pure guessing.<ref name=VT/>\n\n==Appearance==\nThe cartographic representation of Emyn Arnen has changed between the [[General Map of Middle-earth]] published in the ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', where the hills are depicted in clear black lines, and [[The West of Middle-earth at the End of the Third Age|the map]] of ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', where the hills are depicted as a dark silhouette with three peaks.<ref>See D.
