Oromë and [[Tulkas]] had dwelt with the Elves for many years, protecting them, so when they left to make war preparations,<ref name=nome/> the Valar put a guard about Cuiviénen to protect the Elves from battle for the following two [[Valian Years]].<ref name=\"Annals\">{{AA|47-8}}</ref>\n\nIt was a group of great [[Maiar]] to guard the Elves meanwhile. They were [[Tarindor]] (later Saruman), [[Olórin]] (Gandalf), [[Hrávandil]] (Radagast), [[Palacendo]] and [[Haimenar]]. They were led by [[Melian]], who had travelled to Cuiviénen before the Five Guardians; she was the sixth Maiar guardian and was the only female spirit among them.<ref name=nome>{{NM|P1xiii}}, pp. 95, 99</ref> \n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n''[[The Annals of Aman]]'' mention the Valian guard set to protect the Elves, but its nature is not specified. The Five Guardians appear in a late and unfinished version of the [[legendarium]], written by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] while revising key dates of the [[Valian Years]]. As the editor [[Carl F. Hostetter]] comments, these five Maiar were apparently the later [[Istari]], but the last two names are not specified,<ref>{{NM|P1xiii}}, \"Notes\", p. 102, note 7</ref> so it is unclear if they correspond to the earlier [[Blue Wizards]].\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Maiar]]\n[[Category:Organizations]]"}}}
