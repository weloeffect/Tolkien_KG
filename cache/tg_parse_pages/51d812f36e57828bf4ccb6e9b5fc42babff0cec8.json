In response, the Bucklanders cut down hundreds of trees to make a great bonfire in [[Bonfire Glade]] and burned a long strip next to the Hay on its east side.<ref name=\"Old Forest\"/>\n=== Appearance ===\nConstantly tended, it was thick and tall, and ran for over twenty miles.  At the north end the Hay ran down to the river-bank close to the [[Brandywine Bridge]].  Nearby was an opening in the barrier, the [[Buckland Gate|North Gate]], where gate-guards were posted day and night.<ref>{{FR|I5}}</ref> From there the Hay wound southwards to the confluence of the [[Baranduin|Brandywine River]] and the [[Withywindle]]. East of [[Crickhollow]] there was a private entrance that the [[Brandybuck Family|Brandybucks]] used, which was a brick-lined tunnel under the Hay with a gate of thick-set iron bars on the forest side.<ref name=\"Old Forest\">{{FR|I6}}</ref> At the south end there was either another gate or the hedge ended before the meeting of the two rivers because the town of [[Breredon]] was on the Old Forest side of the barrier.<ref>{{AB|Preface}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - High Hay.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The High Hay in ]''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The High Hay forms a perimeter all around [[Buckland]] with only two passages: the [[Buckland Gate]] and tunnel leading into the [[Old Forest]] itself.\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Buckland]]\n[[Category:Walls]]\n\n[[de:Hoher Hag]]\n[[fi:Pitkät Puut]]"}}}
