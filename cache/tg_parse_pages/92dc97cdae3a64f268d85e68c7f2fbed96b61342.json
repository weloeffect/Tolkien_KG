He was the first to spot the sleeping [[Húrin]]  when he had come to that place. A fellow guard, [[Forhend]], said that Sagroth could be trusted to always find trouble, for he knew that Hardang would not be pleased with the discovery of Húrin within Brethil.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, p. 274</ref>\n\nLater, when Hardang wanted to send [[Manthor]] away while he dealt with Húrin, he told him to go until Captain [[Avranc]] came to take command (this was an on-the-spot promotion of Avranc). Manthor immediately quit his service to Hardang and stated that he had left Sagroth, \"a woodman older and wiser\" than Avranc in command.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, p. 274</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nWhen \"[[The Wanderings of Húrin]]\" was in draft form, in the second appearance of Sagroth's name it was emended to ''[[Galhir]]'' but then returned to ''Sagroth''. [[Christopher Tolkien]] speculates that this wasn't a change of name, but an introduction of a new character in the story.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, note 32, p. 303</ref>\n  \n{{references}}\n[[Category:Edain]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Folk of Haleth]]\n\n[[fi:Sagroth]]"}}}
