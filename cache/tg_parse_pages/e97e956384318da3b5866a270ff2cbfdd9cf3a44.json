Doran''', is an American author, best known for his book ''[[Toward the Gleam]]'', which resulted in two sequels, ''[[Toward the Gleam#The Lucifer Ego|The Lucifer Ego]]'' and ''[[Toward the Gleam#Kataklusmós|Kataklusmós]]''. All three draw inspiration from [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s writings and recount a fictional version of Tolkien's \"discovery\" of [[Middle-earth|an ancient civilization]] which would inspire his books, most notably ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n\nBesides his engineering career and fiction novels, Doran has also contributed to notable American newspapers, including the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, and the New York Times.<ref>[https://ignatius.com/authors/t-m-doran/ Brief biography of Doran] (accessed 20 April 2024) on [https://ignatius.com ignatius.com]</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n{{blockquote|T.M.
