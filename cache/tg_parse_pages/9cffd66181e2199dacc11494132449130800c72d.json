It resulted in the selection of [[Fingolfin]] as their [[High King of the Noldor|High King]] and the relocation of the [[House of Fëanor]] to [[East Beleriand]].\n\n== Background ==\nIn {{FA|5}} the long history of strife and hatred between the Noldorin Houses of [[House of Fingolfin|Fingolfin]] and of Fëanor was assuaged when [[Fingon]], son of Fingolfin, rescued [[Maedhros]], son of [[Fëanor]] and now leader of the House of Fëanor, from [[Morgoth]]'s captivity on [[Thangorodrim]].<ref>{{GA|61}}</ref> Maedhros begged forgiveness for the desertion in [[Araman]], and gave back the goods of Fingolfin that had been borne away in the ships,<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}: §98</ref> including many horses from [[Valinor]].<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}, pg. 217</ref>\n\nWith the Noldor forces now united, they sent messengers far and wide to explore Beleriand and treat with the [[Sindar]] who dwelt there. Among them was [[Angrod]] who served as a messenger of his brother [[Finrod]] and met with King [[Thingol]] in [[Doriath]], a meeting that was permitted due to the kinship between them, as Angrod's mother [[Eärwen]] was Thingol's niece. Angrod told Thingol of the deeds, numbers, and forces of the Noldor, though he omitted the misdeeds of Fëanor, such as the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë|Kinslaying]], as he now deemed that such griefs had been forgiven. Thingol, proclaiming himself Lord of Beleriand, gave permission for the Noldor to dwell in [[Hithlum]], [[Dorthonion]], and the countries east of Doriath; he refrained from permitting them to settle where other Sindar of his folk were already dwelling and cautioned that the Noldor were to mind their conduct, as all who abide within Beleriand must heed his word.<ref>{{GA|§62-64}}</ref>\n\n==The council==\nAt the council in Mithrim the Noldor were pondering matters such as settlement of [[Beleriand]], how to deal with the Sindar, and how  war should be conducted against Morgoth. Additionally, while war with Morgoth was the cause for them to come to Middle-earth, many of their people wished to seek new homes in fairer countries in the south, where they might increase in peace.<ref name=\"council\">{{GA|§65-70}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Catherine_Chmiel_-_Maedhros_indeed_rebuked_Caranthir_sketch.jpg|thumb|right|Maedhros rebukes Caranthir. Art by [[Catherine Chmiel]]]]\nAt this council Angrod delivered the message of Thingol, which was not received well by the Noldor, with the [[sons of Fëanor]] especially wroth by Thingol's haughtiness. Maedhros laughed at it, asserting that Thingol simply gave them leave to dwell where he had no power and that the Noldor, having rescued the rest of Beleriand from Morgoth's [[Orcs]], would dwell where it seemed good for them to do so. [[Caranthir]], however, did not love the [[House of Finarfin|sons of Finarfin]] and was much harsher in his response to Angrod. He disapproved of the choice of a son of Finarfin as the Noldor representative, and of Angrod's sharing of information with Thingol, who he referred to as a \"Dark Elf\". He further stated that the sons of Finarfin should ''\"not so swiftly forget that their father was a lord of the Noldor, though their mother was of other kin\"''.<ref name=\"council\"/>\n\nAt this outburst Angrod, now himself wroth, left the council. While Maedhros rebuked Caranthir, the other Noldor in attendance, of both followings, were troubled by these words, fearing that the fell spirits of the sons of Fëanor would ever burst into rash words or violence. This influenced their following decision to choose an overlord of the Exiles, with nearly all the princes choosing Fingolfin. The sons of Fëanor took this choice ill, with the exception of Maedhros, who restrained his brothers and waived his claim to the kingship, stating to Fingolfin, ''\"If there lay no grievance between us, lord, still the choice would come rightly to thee, the eldest here of the house of Finwë, and not the least wise\"'', before he and his brothers departed from the council.<ref name=\"council\"/>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nSoon after the council, the House of Fëanor departed from Mithrim and settled in East Beleriand, including the least defensible position in their leaguer on Angband at what would become known as the [[March of Maedhros]]. It was said that Maedhros himself devised this, both to lessen the chance of strife between the houses and to face the chief peril of an assault himself. From here, the House of Fëanor had little dealings with their kinsfolk westward, save at need.<ref name=\"council\"/>\n\nMaedhros himself remained in friendship with the houses of Fingolfin and Finarfin and for a time would come among them for common council.<ref name=\"council\"/>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Events]]\n[[Category:First Age]]\n[[Category:Noldor]]"}}}
