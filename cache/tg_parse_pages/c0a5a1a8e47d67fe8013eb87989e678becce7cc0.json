It was added as an extra day every four years to accommodate annual deficits between a 365-day calendar and the actual length of a [[coranar|year]] (which is a little under a quarter of a day longer) except when this year was the last of the century. \n\nOverlithe occurred between [[Mid-year's Day]] and the second of the two normal [[Lithedays]] (2 Lithe). It had no weekday name, and was treated as a special holiday by the inhabitants of [[the Shire]].\n\nA leap year was {{SR|1420}}, and on that Overlithe there was the greatest merrymaking, because of its plentifous harvest and wonderful summer.<ref>{{App|Calendars}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Hobbit Calendar]]"}}}
