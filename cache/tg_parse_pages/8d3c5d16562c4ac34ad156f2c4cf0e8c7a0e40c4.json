The pillar was extremely tall, rising to the stars, and shone like pale blue crystal. Melkor claimed that Ringil and its southern twin [[Helkar]] were made of a strong, imperishable substance that he had devised; in reality he lied for they were made of ice (a material unknown to the other [[Valar]]).  When Aulë's lamps were placed upon them (silver in the north and gold in the south) the ice melted and caused great floods to pour into the seas.<ref>{{LT1|III}}, pp. 69-70</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n{{title}}\n[[Category:Towers]]\n[[Category:Quenya locations]]"}}}
