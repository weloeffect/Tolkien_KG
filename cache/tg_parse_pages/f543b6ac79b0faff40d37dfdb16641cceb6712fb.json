In the character list appended to ''[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]'' Gothmog was described as \"a son of Melko and the ogress [[Fluithuin]],\"<ref>{{LT2|IIIn}}</ref>{{rp|216}} but eventually, the idea that the Valar had [[Valarindi|children]] was discarded altogether.\n\nWhen the armies of Melko attacked [[Gondolin]] and surrounded it, they could not climb the slippery stone of [[Amon Gwareth]]. Then Gothmog led them to the northern gate of the city and piled his iron siege equipment against it until it broke from sheer pressure.<ref name=\"III\">{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|176}} He also took a front-line position against [[Rog]], and with treacherous strategy he cut off the rearguard of the [[House of the Hammer of Wrath]], destroying them completely.<ref name=\"III\" />{{rp|179}} Later he beat down [[Tuor]] in single combat in the [[Square of the Palace]], but the elf-lord [[Ecthelion|Ecthelion of the Fountain]], who was badly wounded, rose and stood over him. Ecthelion stood no chance against the Lord of Balrogs, and lost his sword in the brief struggle. But then Ecthelion leaped forward, and stabbed Gothmog in the breast with the spike atop his helm. They both fell into the [[Fountain of the King]], where Gothmog, if not already killed by the spike, drowned with his opponent.<ref name=\"III\" />{{rp|183–4}}\n\n===Later concepts===\nIn one of Tolkien's early Middle-earth writings, ''[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]'', \"[[Lungorthin]], Lord of Balrogs\" is mentioned.<ref>{{LB|1e}}, p. 98</ref> It is not, however, certain if it was another name for Gothmog, or it simply meant \"a Balrog lord\".
