He took it to [[Middle-earth]] during the [[Exile of the Noldor]], along with other treasures he brought from [[Tirion]],<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref> and wore it with him in [[Nargothrond]].\n[[File:Antti Autio - The Oath of Felagund.jpg|thumb|left|''The Oath of Felagund'' by [[Antti Autio]]]]\nDuring the [[Dagor Bragollach]] the [[Adan]] [[Barahir]] saved his life, and Finrod gave him the ring as a token of eternal friendship between Finrod and the House of Barahir. \n\nBarahir wore the Ring for the rest of his life, until his hand, still wearing it, was taken by the leader of  the [[Orcs]] who [[Massacre at Tarn Aeluin|killed him]], as a proof of his feat. But [[Beren]] went through great perils to avenge his father and retrieved his hand. Beren laid the hand to rest with the rest of his father's remains, but kept and wore the Ring.<ref name=sberen>{{S|Beren}}</ref>\n[[File:Anke Eißmann - Finrod is reminded of his oath.jpeg|thumb|''Finrod is reminded of his oath'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]\nWhen Beren was assigned the [[Quest for the Silmaril]], he went to [[Nargothrond]] and used it as a token to seek Finrod's help. Finrod fulfilled his pledge and even found his death in the dungeons of [[Minas Tirith (Beleriand)|Minas Tirith]] in order to save Beren.\n\nThe Ring's fate in the following centuries is only vaguely recorded. Through [[Dior]], his daughter [[Elwing]] and her son [[Elros]], it found its way to [[Númenor]]. Apparently it remained an heirloom of the [[Kings of Númenor]], until King [[Tar-Elendil]] did not give it to his heir [[Tar-Meneldur]], but to his eldest daughter [[Silmariën]], who was not allowed to succeed him on the throne. She in turn gave the ring to her son [[Valandil (Lord of Andúnië)|Valandil]], first [[Lords of Andúnië|Lord of Andúnië]]. The Ring was handed down to the succeeding Lords of Andúnië until the last of the [[Faithful]]. Thus it survived the [[Downfall of Númenor]] when the [[Faithful]] escaped to [[Middle-earth]].<ref>{{UT|3a}}, Note 2</ref>\n\nIn the [[Third Age]], the ring was again passed in direct line from [[Elendil]], the last of the Lords of Andúnië, as an heirloom of the [[Kings of Arnor]], and then [[Kings of Arthedain]] until the [[Fall of Fornost|fall]] of [[Arthedain]]. \n\nThe last King of Arthedain, [[Arvedui]], gave the ring to the chief of the [[Lossoth]] of [[Forochel]], thankful for the help he received from them. Years after {{TA|1975}}, it was ransomed from the Snowmen by the [[Rangers of the North]], and it was kept safe at [[Rivendell]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>\n\nEventually, in {{TA|2952}}, it was given by [[Elrond]] to [[Aragorn]] son of [[Arathorn II|Arathorn]], when he was told of his true name and lineage, together with the shards of [[Narsil]]. In {{TA|2980}}, while in [[Lothlórien|Lórien]], Aragorn gave the ring to [[Arwen|Arwen Undómiel]], and thus they were betrothed.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>\n\nNothing is said of the fate of the ring in the [[Fourth Age]], but unless it went with Arwen to her grave at [[Cerin Amroth]], it most likely passed to the Kings of the [[Reunited Kingdom]], [[House of Telcontar|descendants]] of Aragorn and Arwen.\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn ''[[The Lay of Leithian]]'', the Ring belonged to [[Finrod#Other versions of the legendarium|Finrod]] (later Finarfin) and inherited by his son [[Inglor|Inglor Felagund]] (later Finrod). When Beren shows the Ring in [[Menegroth]], it is described as thus:\n{{blockquote|Proud are the words, and all there turned<br>to see the jewels green that burned<br>in [[Beren]]'s ring.
