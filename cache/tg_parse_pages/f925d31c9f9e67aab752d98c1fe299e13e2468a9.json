Tolkien]] after the [[Max Schuchart|Dutch]] and [[Åke Ohlmarks|Swedish]] translations had come out.<ref name=\"RC\">{{HM|RC}}, pp. 750-781</ref> \n\n==Publication history==\nThe '''''Guide''''' was first published in '''''[[A Tolkien Compass]]''''', edited by [[Christopher Tolkien]].<ref name=\"ATC\">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), \"Guide to the Names in ''The Lord of the Rings''\", published in ''[[A Tolkien Compass]]'' (edited by [[Jared Lobdell]])</ref> It was included in Open Court's first hardcover edition and Del Rey Books' paperback, but was dropped from the second edition at the request of [[Tolkien Estate]], the legal owners of the text.<ref>[[Tom Shippey]], \"Foreword\", published in ''[[A Tolkien Compass]]'', Second Edition (edited by [[Jared Lobdell]]), pages vii-xi</ref> \n\nA new edition by [[Wayne G.

Hammond and Scull included a list of abbreviations, as well as extra notes within straight brackets. \n* Christopher Tolkien's edition follows his father's text in that it refers to the second, revised edition,<ref name=\"ATC\"/> while Hammond and Scull also include references to their own [[The Lord of the Rings (50th Anniversary Edition)|50th Anniversary Edition]] in straight brackets.<ref name=\"RC\"/>\n* The first two sections have been renamed in Christopher Tolkien's edition: ''Names of Persons and Peoples'' and ''Place-names'' versus ''Persons, Peoples, Creatures'' and ''Places''. The name of the third section, ''Things'', is not changed.\n\n===Smaller differences===\n* '''Barrow-wight''': Hammond and Scull misspell the Dutch version, as well as its English translation: ''grafghest'' and \"grave-ghast\"<ref name=\"RC\"/> rather than proper ''grafgeest''.<ref>[[J.R.R.

Tolkien's essay ''[[The Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor]]'', as Hammond and Scull quoted in their notes to ''[[Appendix A]]'' of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.</ref> the rest of the Hammond and Scull-edition uses the word \"Rohan\".\n* '''Heathertoes''': Christopher Tolkien spells the suggested German translation as ''Heidezhen'',<ref name=\"ATC\"/> Hammond and Scull as ''Heidezehn''.<ref name=\"RC\"/> [[Margaret Carroux]] would eventually use the plural ''Heidezehen'', [[Wolfgang Krege]] singular ''Heidezeh''.<ref>\"[http://ardapedia.herr-der-ringe-film.de/index.php/Der_Herr_der_Ringe:_Namensübersetzungen_-_Personen#H Der Herr der Ringe: Namensübersetzungen - Personen]\", [[Ardapedia]]</ref>\n* '''Orc''': Christopher Tolkien misspells Anglo-Saxon ''orc-neas'' as ''orc-nass''<ref name=\"ATC\"/>\n* '''Wizard''': Christopher Tolkien omits this entry.<ref name=\"ATC\"/>\n* '''Wormtongue''': Christopher Tolkien misspells the Rohan form as ''wyrm-tunga'', Hammond and Scull give ''wyrm-tunge''.\n* '''Woses''': Christopher Tolkien mistranscribes the explanation as \"old men of the woods\".
