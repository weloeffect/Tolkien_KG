This resulted to the [[Battle of Palisor]], the first war between Elves and goblins. In some earlier sketch, Fangli and his evil Dwarves, conquered Palisor. The Men corrupted by him became wild and savage peoples, worshiping Melko.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Thû]]\n\n{{references|notes}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Servants of Melkor]]"}}}
