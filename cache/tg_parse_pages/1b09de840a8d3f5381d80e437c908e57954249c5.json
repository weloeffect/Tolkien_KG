Aragorn suggests Arwen might still take passage on a ship from Mithlond into the West, but by this time Arwen had long forfeited the right to live in the [[Undying Lands]]. The words \"and some say [Círdan] dwells there still, until the Last Ship sets sail into the West\" derive from the [[Red Book of Westmarch]], and not from the ''original'' [[Red Book]], which has not been preserved, but from a copy of it, the first of them being the [[Thain's Book]], copied in {{FoA|171}}. Thus, the speculation about [[Círdan]] still dwelling in [[Mithlond]] cannot be exactly dated to a period before [[Aragorn II Elessar|Elessar]]'s and [[Arwen]]'s death. This means that the Last Ship would have sailed at some unknown date after {{FoA|171}}.</ref><ref name=AppTale>{{App|Tale}}</ref><ref name=prologue/> [[Celeborn]] eventually sought the Grey Havens, taking with him the last memory of the [[Elder Days]] in [[Middle-earth]].
