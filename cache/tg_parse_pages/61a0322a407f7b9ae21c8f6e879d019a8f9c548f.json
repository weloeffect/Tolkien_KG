They had an uncertain number and no charted course could go through them, and as such they ensnared any ships trying to reach [[Aman]] without permission. Additionally the seas about them were filled with mists. The isles were enchanted, and anyone who set foot on them fell asleep forever. The creation of the Enchanted Isles and the Shadowy Seas was part of the ''[[Nurtalë Valinóreva]]'', the Hiding of Valinor.<ref>{{S|Sun}}</ref>\n\nHowever, when [[Eärendil]] and [[Elwing]] came upon the Enchanted Isles in [[Vingilótë]] they passed through successfully. This may be attributed to the [[Silmaril]] that Eärendil wore upon his brow as they sailed into the West.<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref>\n\nThe isles were apparently either removed from [[Arda]] or at least made less sinister after the [[War of Wrath]], as Tol Eressëa could be seen from [[Meneltarma]] on [[Númenor]] without problems and no obstacles are mentioned when the [[Great Armament]] reached [[Eldamar]].<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> Certainly after the [[Downfall of Númenor]] they were gone.\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n[[Christopher Tolkien]] has suggested that the Enchanted Isles were likely inspired from what was known in early versions of the [[legendarium]] as the '''Magic Isles''' or '''Magic Archipelago'''.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}</ref> In an early map of the world titled ''[[I Vene Kemen]]'', the [[Qenya]] name '''''I Tolli Kuruvar''''' is glossed as \"Magic Isles\".<ref>{{LT1|Vene}}, pp. 84-85</ref>\n\n==In other stories==\nThe Magic Isles are referenced in Tolkien's ''[[Roverandom]]''. In the story, written down in [[1927]], the great whale [[Uin]] takes the enchanted dog [[Rover]]andom (formerly known as Rover) on adventures through the seas: Uin takes Roverandom through the [[Shadowy Seas]] to the [[Bay of Eldamar|Bay of Fairyland]] beyond the Magic Isles where Rover saw the [[Pelóri|Mountains of Elvenhome]] and the light of Faery. Roverandom thought he could see the white glint of [[Tirion|a city of Elves on a green hill far away in the distance]].<ref name=\"Roverandom\">{{HM|R}}, pp. 73-4</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Shadowy Seas]]\n*[[Sindanórië]]\n*[[Twilit Isles]]\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Aman]]\n[[Category:Islands]]\n[[de:Verwunschene Inseln]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/eaux/iles/iles enchantees]]\n[[fi:Lumotut saaret]]"}}}
