Tolkien. Founded in [[1969]] with the blessing of J.R.R. Tolkien, it has expanded its membership across the United Kingdom, Europe and the world. Its President is Tolkien, the Vice-president is [[Priscilla Tolkien]]; since [[2025]], [[Shaun Gunner]] has been the Society's Chief Executive Officer.\n\n==History==\nThe Tolkien Society was formed in 1969 by [[Vera Chapman]], an [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]-educated retired teacher/civil servant, who, horrified at the annexation of Tolkien's works by 'the drugs-orientated writings of hippiedom',<ref>[[Charles Noad|Charles E. Noad]], 'The Early Days of the Tolkien Society', [[A Long-expected Party: Progress Report 1|''A Long-expected Party: Progress Report'' 1]], p. 10</ref> decided to form a group dedicated to the true appreciation of Tolkien's works.\n\nOn [[6 November]] [[1969]], Chapman announced the formation of the Tolkien Society in the United Kingdom in the ''New Statesman''.<ref name=\"CGII\">{{CG|II}}, p. 287</ref> Initially London-based, the Society would meet in Chapman's North London flat; they kept in communication via a photocopied newsletter called ''[[Belladonna's Broadsheet]]'' (Chapman had adopted the name \"[[Belladonna Took]]\" as her Middle-earth alias), which was first published in December 1969.<ref name=\"CGII\" /> The Society's inaugural meeting was held in January [[1970]],<ref name=\"CGII\" /> and its constitution was ratified on [[15 January]] [[1972]].\n\nThe Tolkien Society grew steadily, and Chapman willingly passed over responsibility for the bulletin to other hands whilst a more scholarly publication, \"[[Mallorn (journal)|Mallorn]]\" also appeared. ''Belladonna's Broadsheet'' went through a number of identity changes, being \"Henneth Annun\" for one issue before its then editor, John Martin, adopted its current name: \"[[Amon Hen (journal)|Amon Hen]]\".\n\nThe Society also undertook a pilgrimage to [[Oxford]], exploring the colleges and sites relevant to J.R.R. Tolkien's life. Visit was made to [[Wolvercote Cemetery]] where wreaths in tribute were laid. At that first visit, it was found that a wild bramble had rooted in the topsoil of the grave. This was rapidly uprooted, and the Society offered to buy a rose plant, the offer of which [[Priscilla Tolkien]] - Tolkien's only daughter - accepted. The weekend event culminated with a visit to the home of Priscilla Tolkien.\n\nIn [[2014]], the Society inaugurated its annual '''[[The Tolkien Society Awards|Awards]]'''.<ref>{{webcite|author=Daniel Helen|articleurl=https://www.tolkiensociety.org/2014/03/new-tolkien-society-awards/|articlename=Awards|date=17 March 2014|website=TS|accessed=15 December 2022}}</ref>\n\nIn [[2025]] the Society was restructured as a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_incorporated_organisation Charitable Incorporated Organisation]<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/en/charity-search/-/charity-details/5251709/governance?_uk_gov_ccew_onereg_charitydetails_web_portlet_CharityDetailsPortlet_organisationNumber=5251709|articlename=Charity Commision - THE TOLKIEN SOCIETY - Charity number: 1211591|dated=|website=[https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/charity-commission The Charity Commission]|accessed=13 November 2025}}</ref> with Shaun Gunner as the first CEO of the Society.<ref name=\"CEO\" /> One of the main benefits of this change was the ability for the charity to be able to enter into contracts, employ staff, own/lease property in its own name whilst minimising the trustees financial liability for the charity's debts or legal actions.\n\n==Relations with J.R.R. Tolkien==\nIn 1972 [[wikipedia:New Year Honours|New Year Honours]], Tolkien was made a [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) just two days before his birthday. [[Allen and Unwin|Allen & Unwin]] had encouraged the Tolkien Society to write to Tolkien on the occasion, and they sent the following telegram:\n\n{{blockquote|CONGRATULATIONS ON 80TH BIRTHDAY AND HONOUR. ANOTHER 50 YEARS TO BEAT THE OLD TOOK.<BR/>THE TOLKIEN SOCIETY (IN BRITAIN)|The Tolkien Society's telegram to J.R.R. Tolkien<ref name=\"Mallorn50-21\">[[Charles E. Noad]], \"The Tolkien Society - the early days\" in [[Henry Gee]] (ed.) ''[[Mallorn 50]]'', p. 21</ref>}}\n\nThe Society also published a congratulatory message in ''The Times'' on the [[3 January]] in the 'BIRTHDAYS' section: \"''TOLKIEN. Professor J. R. R. Tolkien, C.B.E. Congratulations on your 80th birthday. 'Elen sila lumenn' omentielmo.' The Tolkien Society.''\" As a birthday present, the Society also sent him a green china tobacco jar - designed with a huntsman and a white deer - which included best Latakia Mixture tobacco; attached was the following note:\n\n{{blockquote|FROM all Hobbits, Elves, Elf-friends, Dwarves, Ents, Numenoreans, Rohirrim, etc. etc. etc. of the TOLKIEN SOCIETY (in Britain) with love and honour and hearty congratulations, to the creator of so much wonder. Although not to be compared with the true LONGBOTTOM LEAF, we hope that this will at least raise a few smoke-rings of happy recollection.<br/>THE TOLKIEN SOCIETY|The Tolkien Society's message to J.R.R. Tolkien on his birthday<ref name=\"Mallorn50-21\"/>}}\n\n[[Joy Hill]], Tolkien's secretary, phoned Vera Chapman on the 3 January and said, \"''Of all the tributes he received, this was the one that gave the greatest pleasure.''\"<ref name=\"Mallorn50-21\" /> A month later, [[Letter to Vera Chapman and the Tolkien Society|he wrote to her]]:\n\n{{blockquote|Dear Mrs. Chapman,<br/>May I thank you and the Tolkien Society for your good wishes and kind gift on my 80th birthday. I appreciated your generosity very much indeed.<br/>Best wishes,<br/>Yours sincerely,<br/>J.R.R. Tolkien [signed]|[[Letter to Vera Chapman and the Tolkien Society|Letter from J.R.R. Tolkien to Vera Chapman]], dated [[6 February]] [[1972]]<ref name=\"Mallorn50-21\"/>}}\n\n===President===\nOn the [[27 June]] [[1972]], Vera Chapman was invited to a sherry party by [[Rayner Unwin]], where she met Tolkien himself. After exchanging a few words with him about the [[Belladonna Took|belladonna]] plant, she asked if he would would be willing to be the Society's honorary president; he said \"''Certainly''\" before concluding, \"''If I can help your society in any way, I will''.\"<ref name=\"Mallorn50-22\">[[Charles E. Noad]], \"The Tolkien Society - the early days\" in [[Henry Gee]] (ed.) ''[[Mallorn 50]]'', p. 22</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of J.R.R. Tolkien on [[2 September]] [[1973]], the Tolkien Society offered the post of Honorary President to [[Christopher Tolkien]], Tolkien's son, but Christopher declined saying he thought the his father should remain president forever. At the [[wiktionary:AGM|AGM]] on [[16 February]] [[1974]] the motion was passed that J.R.R. Tolkien should remain the Honorary President ''in perpetuo''; he remains the Society's president to this day.<ref name=\"Mallorn50-23\">[[Charles E.
