The album was released on [[5 June]], [[2013]], through Napalm Records. ''Old Mornings Dawn'' was released seven years after their previous full-length album ''Oath Bound'', which is the longest gap between any Summoning albums. With two bonus tracks contained by the box-set and vinyl versions, this album is Summoning's longest album to date. \n\nThe lyrics for four of the tracks are based on the story of [[Eärendil]] the mariner, ancestor of the kings of [[Númenor]]. The lyrics of two tracks are based on the poems \"City of Present Sorrow\" and \"Town of Dreams\", by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. The rest of the lyrics came from unknown writers or were written by the band in a style that fits within the Tolkien universe.\n\n==Track listing==\n\n#\"Evernight\" – 2:48\n#\"Flammifer\" – 7:07\n#\"Old Morning's Dawn\" – 9:29\n#\"The White Tower\" – 9:35\n#\"Caradhras\" – 9:31\n#\"Of Pale White Morns and Darkened Eves\" – 8:22\n#\"The Wandering Fire\" – 8:02\n#\"Earthshine\" – 9:33\n\n======Bonus tracks======\n\n#\"The Darkening of Valinor\" (Instrumental)  – 4:04\n#\"With Fire and Sword\"  – 6:46\n\n[[Category:Albums]]"}}}
