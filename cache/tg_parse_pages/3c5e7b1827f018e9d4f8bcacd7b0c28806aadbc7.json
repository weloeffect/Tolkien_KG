Now it's out.|Charlie Vickers, Screen Rant}}\n{{quote|A lot of the subconscious work was a creating a human life for Halbrand. In order for Sauron to effectively portray Halbrand and deceive people, I think he would have to have a pretty comprehensive life mapped out. I guess all the subconscious work I did was in creating that and then also creating Sauron’s life and really thinking about where he’s come from. It’s a lot of reading, but also a lot of practical things. We were so lucky in New Zealand to have the country. So I went hiking for a long time to create Sauron’s world. I went to Tongariro National Park, which is [what] they used for Mount Doom in The Fellowship of the Ring, the original trilogy. So the subconscious work was all kind of there. And I hope that it informed the performance — I kept that in my mind as we were going|Charlie Vickers, Polygon}}\n\n{{references}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{WP|Charlie Vickers}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vickers, Charlie}}\n[[Category:Actors and actresses]]\n[[Category:Australian people]]\n[[Category:People by name]]\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) cast]]\n[[fi:Charlie Vickers]]"}}}
