The Elves, led by [[Legolas]], gave chase, but [[Bolg]] and his orcs attacked them. As the Dwarves were not boxed in the barrels and merely used them to stay afloat, they could fight back against the orcs with whatever weapons they could find. [[Kíli]] was injured by a Morgul arrow when he tried to open a sluice gate in the river.\n\n{{references}}\n{{companyroute}}\n[[Category:Rivers]]\n[[Category:Rhovanion]]\n[[de:Waldfluss]]\n[[fi:Metsävirta]]"}}}
