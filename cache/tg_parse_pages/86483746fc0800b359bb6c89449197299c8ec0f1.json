When Théoden asked Gandalf about his wizardry over the trees, Gandalf laughed and told them that it had not been his doing. He asked them to come with him to [[Isengard]] if they wished to know more about the trees.\n\nAfter resting, the [[men]] set forth again. They came to [[Orthanc]], the citadel of [[Saruman]] at Isengard. They were surprised to find that [[Treebeard]] and his [[Ents]] had destroyed the citadel, and that Saruman and [[Gríma|Wormtongue]] had hidden themselves away in [[Orthanc]], guarded by none other than [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]]. Théoden, who was anxious to see Treebeard, said good-bye to the [[Hobbits]] and accompanied Gandalf to the Northern wall.\n==Composition==\nTolkien wrote this chapter, along with the five final chapters of Book III were written as a whole (not sequentially) during his spare time in summer and autumn [[1942]]. He wrote seven different versions of the dialogue between Gandalf and Théoden. Eventually, after making a fair copy, a lot of that version, its chronology and route to Orthanc, was rejected and rewritten.<ref>{{CG|CG}}, p. xxiv</ref>\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Road to Isengard}}\n[[fi:Tie Rautapihaan (TSH)]]\n[[Category:The Two Towers chapters]]"}}}
