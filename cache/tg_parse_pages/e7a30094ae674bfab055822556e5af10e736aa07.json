It makes up the central story of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', and also inadvertently led to the [[War of the Ring]].\n\n==History==\nPlans for the quest were first conceived when the [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] lord [[Thorin]] [[Oakenshield]], heading westward to the [[Blue Mountains]], had a chance encounter with [[Gandalf|Gandalf the Grey]] at [[the Prancing Pony]] in the village of [[Bree]] on the [[15 March]] {{TA|2941}}. Gandalf had long been concerned about the weak state of the North; ever since [[Smaug]] the [[Dragons|Dragon]] had [[Sack of Erebor|destroyed]] both the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] and the neighbouring city of [[Dale]] in {{TA|2770}}, he feared that [[Sauron]] might use the [[Desolation of the Dragon|desolation]] around the [[Lonely Mountain]] to regain the northern passes in the mountains and the old lands of [[Angmar]]. He also feared that Sauron might gain the allegiance of Smaug and use him to terrible effect. Gandalf had also become aware of Thorin's desire to mount a battle against the [[Fire-drakes|fire-drake]] Smaug, but knew it would not be enough. Thorin wanted advice, and Gandalf in turn wanted to discuss the Dragon with the Dwarf. Ultimately, the [[Wizards|Wizard]] concocted a plan wherein Thorin could destroy Smaug and recover his family fortune, albeit with a [[burglar]] of Gandalf's own choosing. Gandalf had a feeling that a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] should be involved, and he remembered [[Bilbo Baggins]] from his past visits to [[the Shire]].<ref name=\"Erebor\">{{UT|Erebor}}</ref>\n\nWhen Gandalf first approached Bilbo regarding this proposition on [[26 April]] {{TA|2941}}, the Hobbit wanted nothing to do with such sort of \"adventure\". However, Gandalf left a mark on the door of [[Bag End]] to direct the rest of the [[Thorin and Company|Dwarves]] willing to embark on the quest for meeting there the following day. It soon became clear that Gandalf had volunteered Bilbo to be a \"burglar\" for the Dwarves on their adventure. The Hobbit protested, and the Dwarves grumbled that the soft little Hobbit did not seem suited to their adventure. [[Glóin]] remarked that he looked \"more like a grocer than a burglar\". Gandalf, however, was certain that Bilbo was useful, and insisted that there was more to Bilbo than met the eye. Despite his strong objections to going on the journey, Gandalf coerced Bilbo out the door the next morning as the Company began their quest.<ref>{{H|1}}</ref> From the Dwarves' point of view, Bilbo's initial task was simply to steal gold and heirlooms from Smaug's hoard. However, Gandalf had a foreboding that Bilbo's presence would be essential in bringing about the success of the quest and the greater events that would follow.<ref>{{UT|Erebor}} \"I knew in my heart that Bilbo must go with him, or the whole quest would be a failure—or, as I should say now, the far more important events by the way would not come to pass.\"</ref>\n\nThe party travelled through the [[Lone-lands]] and were saved by Gandalf from three [[Trolls]] (in a place known as [[Trollshaws]]) before stopping for a two-week respite in [[Rivendell]]. On their journey eastward through the [[Misty Mountains]], the Company inadvertently ended up in [[Goblin-town]] and escaped after Gandalf killed the [[Great Goblin]]; Bilbo, having been separated from the Dwarves, ended up finding [[One Ring|a magic ring]] by [[Gollum's lake]]. After staying with [[Beorn]] for a couple of days, the Company continued through the [[Rhovanion|Wilderland]] and into [[Mirkwood]] (at which point Gandalf leaves them to participate in the [[Attack on Dol Guldur]]), where they were captured by [[Elves]] of the [[Woodland Realm]] after escaping from [[spiders]]. Bilbo smuggled the Company into [[Lake-town]] via barrels where the [[Lake-men]] ultimately agreed to give them supplies for the last stage of their quest.<ref>{{H|2}}; {{H|3}}; {{H|4}}; {{H|5}}; {{H|6}}; {{H|7}}; {{H|8}}; {{H|9}}; {{H|10}}</ref>\n\nWhen the Company finally reached the Lonely Mountain, they entered through the secret [[Back Door]] once the last light of [[Durin's Day]] revealed its keyhole. Having been designated the \"burglar\" for the group, Bilbo was assigned to go inside and \"burgle\" something for the Dwarves. The Hobbit came across the great Dragon lying atop the Dwarves' great treasure hoard, and stole a golden cup from the hoard. On Bilbo's second visit to the Dragon's lair, Smaug was awake and started talking to Bilbo. Having guessed that the intruders were being aided by Lake-town, but wrongly suspecting that the Lake-men were behind the plot, Smaug flew off in a rage to lay Lake-town waste in revenge for Bilbo's intrusion. The fire-drake almost completely destroyed the town, but was slain with a [[black arrow]] by one of its residents, whose name was [[Bard]]. With the Dragon now dead, the Dwarves could once again regain domain over the Mountain and their quest was complete.<ref>{{H|11}}; {{H|12}}; {{H|14}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nAfter the death of Smaug, Bard, who had been revealed as the heir to the Lord of Dale, came to the Lonely Mountain to demand compensation in [[gold]] from Thorin so that his people could rebuild their lives. [[Thranduil]], king of the Woodland Realm, also came seeking a share of the treasure. When Thorin refused to part with any of the hoard, but called for reinforcements from other dwarves, especially his cousin [[Dáin Ironfoot]], it almost led to a battle between dwarves on one side and elves and Men on the other. But things were further complicated by the arrival of armies of [[Orcs#Goblins and Orcs|Goblins]] and [[Wargs]] seeking revenge for the death of the Great Goblin at the Company's hands. Thus began the [[Battle of Five Armies]], in which Thorin lost his own life (as did his nephews and nearest heirs, [[Fíli]] and [[Kíli]]). In their place, [[Dáin Ironfoot]] became the new [[King under the Mountain]].\n\nYears later, it would be revealed that the ring Bilbo had taken from [[Gollum]] in the Misty Mountains would in fact turn out to be the One Ring which had once belonged to Sauron, for which he now had his [[Nazgûl|servants]] scouring all over [[Middle-earth]]. It would lead to not only the [[Quest of the Ring]] but also the [[War of the Ring]] and, ultimately, the end of the [[Third Age]].\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''[[2012]]-[[2014]]: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]:'''\n\n:In the prologue of the second ''Hobbit'' film, it is said that the entire Quest was to retrieve the [[Arkenstone]], as possessing it would give Thorin the authority to unite all the Dwarven clans to march on the Erebor, and reclaim it from the Dragon Smaug.\n\n{{References}}\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq\n| prev=[[Fell Winter (Third Age)|Fell Winter]]\n| list=Major events of [[Middle-earth]]\n| dates={{TA|2941}}\n| next=[[War of the Ring]]\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n{{companyroute}}\n[[Category:Events]]\n[[Category:The Hobbit]]\n[[Category:Third Age]]"}}}
