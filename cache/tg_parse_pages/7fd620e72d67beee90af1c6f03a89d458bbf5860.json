It appears in their third full-length album, [[Third Age of the Sun]].\n==Lyrics==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nNone amongst the living \nShall wield the power \nShall know the deepest secrets \nInside his mind \nNone amongst the living \nWill foil his plans \nWill follow his final path \nInto the shadows \n\nGone by the Eastern wilds \nUnnoticed of the great five \nHe was the silent one \nHe who comes afar \nIstari, Ithryn Luin \nWeakest was his heart \n\nNone amongst the dead \nShall have their peace \nShall get their freedom \nDominance of soulless \nNone amongst the dead \nWill deny allegiance \nWill doubt his away \nOver, decease \n\nGreat power comes with chains \nFear of falling looms \nIt can be an eternal curse \nBeware or it's your turn\n</poem>\n[[Category:Songs by Battlelore]]"}}}
