Iorbad was invented for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'' by [[Amazon Studios]].\n\n== History ==\nDuring the late [[Second Age]], the inhabitants of Iorbad were the last to flee to the Watchtower of Ostirith in order to be protected from the [[Orcs]] that were lead by [[Adar]]. The village was presumably destroyed during the [[Udûn (episode)|eruption]] of [[Mount Doom|Orodruin]] if it was not already destroyed by Orcs as [[Hordern]] was.\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Iorbad'' is most likely a [[Sindarin]] word meaning ''old pathway'', being possibly comprised of the elements ''[[Iaur]]'' (\"old\") and ''[[Bâd]]'' (\"pathway\").\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) locations]]"}}}
