[[Peter Jackson|Jackson]] will produce with his co-writing team of [[Fran Walsh]] and [[Philippa Boyens]], who will also write the screenplay with ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim|The War of the Rohirrim]]'' scribes Phoebe Gittins and Arty Papageorgiou.  \n\nThe subject of this film is a longstanding fascination of [[Peter Jackson|Jackson]]'s who developed it quite intensly in 2008 with [[Guillermo del Toro]]. The film is in preproduction with several cast and crew members from previous films already attached, including actor [[Elijah Wood]], concept artists [[John Howe]] and [[Alan Lee]] and others. \n\n==Early Development==\nAlthough the film was only announced in 2023, it had a long gestation period with [[Peter Jackson]], who considered filming this subject in December 1998 and as late as July 2015. During 2008, in particular, the film was in development with a plot synopsis, a tentative budget and an initial cast and crew attached, and drew the attention of further talent like [[Viggo Mortensen]], as well as the press. Elements of this proposed \"bridge film\" were eventually put into ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'' but mostly axed during the early months of the shoot. Jackson also negotiated in 2018 about producing a show for [[Amazon MGM Studios|Amazon Prime]] about the related subject of the travles of young [[Aragorn]], but ended up producing ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim|The War of the Rohirrim]]'' with [[New Line Cinema]] instead.\n\n===During ''The'' ''Lord of the Rings''===\n[[Peter Jackson]] and [[Fran Walsh]] first pitched adapting [[The Hobbit|''The Hobbit'']] and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' around November 1995. ''The Hobbit'' was to be the first in a trilogy that would encompass both novels, and thus needed to lead into ''[[The Lord of the Rings]].'' Although some development was done on ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'' in 1996-1997, it seems [[Peter Jackson|Jackson]] hadn't tackled the practicalies of having to bridge the two works for some time. By February 1997, work on ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'' was postponed until after ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'',<ref>Brian Sibley, Peter Jackson: A Filmmaker's Journey (London: HarperCollins, 2006), pp. 312 ff.</ref> but there were attempts to incorporate elements from ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and its timeframe into ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref>J.
