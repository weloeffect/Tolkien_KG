She would become [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s wife. \n==Biography==\nEdith never knew her father and was brought up in [[Birmingham]] by her mother, and cousin Jenny Grove. Francis Bratt died when Edith was 14 and she was sent to the Dresden House, a boarding school where she developed a love for piano and soon moved into a boarding house.<ref name=ple>{{B|II}}, \"‘Private Lang.’ – And Edith\"</ref>\n\nWhen Tolkien was living at [[37 Duchess Road]], [[Birmingham|Edgbaston]], Edith was a young female lodger who lived in the bedroom beneath Tolkien and his brother Hilary. At the time Tolkien was 16 and Edith was 19. They quickly became close but when Tolkien's guardian [[Francis Xavier Morgan]] found out he forbade contact between them until Tolkien turned 21. During their years apart she got engaged to George Field but when Tolkien sent her a letter on the evening of his twenty-first birthday she broke off her engagement to Field and announced her engagement to Tolkien. Following her engagement she converted to Roman Catholicism.<ref name=ple/>\n\nThey were married on Wednesday, [[22 March]], [[1916]] in the Church of St Mary Immaculate, in Warwickshire, England. Only a few months later Tolkien was shipped to Étaples, France.<ref>[[John Garth]], ''[[Tolkien and the Great War]]''</ref> Her Husband being in the military during [[WWI]] was a very stressful time in her life. She kept a map of France on the wall to help her know where he was. After his return their first child [[John Tolkien]] was born on [[16 November]] [[1917]]\n\nWhile stationed at Kingston upon Hull, Ronald and Edith went on a walk through the woods and she danced for him. He later tells an interviewer [[Bill Cater]], \"We walked in a wood where hemlock was growing, a sea of white flowers.\" This inspired the meeting of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]].<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Bill Cater]]|articleurl=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4726863/We-talked-of-love-death-and-fairy-tales.html|articlename=We talked of love, death and fairy tales|dated=4 December 2001|website=|accessed=13 January 2024}}</ref> After the war the Tolkiens had 3 more children, [[Michael Tolkien|Michael]], [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]] and [[Priscilla Tolkien|Priscilla]].\n\nIn the 1960s they moved near [[Bournemouth]].
