[[Samwise Gamgee]] was their \"'''chief investigator'''\" who had been feeding them all the information that they needed. They all discovered that Frodo was making plans to leave [[the Shire]] in order to escape some danger related to the [[One Ring]] and conspired to assist him without his knowledge - this often meant spying and eavesdropping on Frodo's daily activities and conversations, until finally revealing themselves to Frodo just before he set out to leave, much to his surprise.\n\n== History ==\nIt all began around {{TA|3000}} when a young Merry witnessed [[Bilbo Baggins]] becoming invisible to evade a meeting with the [[Sackville-Bagginses]], noticing him holding a golden trinket. This made him curious, and he even peeked at Bilbo's [[There and Back Again|diary]]. Merry kept this knowledge private, but was always suspicious and thought that after Bilbo's [[Farewell Party]], Frodo would soon follow. He shared this secret information with his friends. Especially after [[April]] {{TA|3018}} they noticed how Frodo was saying \"farewell\" to all of his favorite places, selling [[Bag End]] to the Sackville-Bagginses, and secretive talks with [[Gandalf]]. Samwise Gamgee had heard Gandalf's instructions to Frodo for his departure,<ref>{{FR|Shadow}}</ref> and warned his friends.\n\nAt [[Crickhollow]], Frodo was ready to reveal them that he didn't buy the house to stay but that he is heading for [[Bree]]. The conspirators then told him that they knew that he was leaving all along, and that they are going with him, as Fredegar had prepared everything, provisions and [[ponies]], for their departure.\n\nThey also told him that they know the existence of the Ring and that his flight was related to it. Fredegar was to stay behind to deal with any \"inquisitive folk\" and to keep up the pretense that Frodo was still living there by wearing Frodo's clothes and keeping about the place.<ref>{{FR|Conspiracy}}</ref>\n\nWithout their preparations, Frodo would likely have been captured by the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] before he even escaped the Shire.\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Organisations in the Shire]]"}}}
