When [[Scatha]] attacked [[Framsburg]], [[Frumgar]] lost the use of his sword-arm, after which Fram swore revenge and hunted Scatha alone for two years. Frumgar died shortly after Fram returned with Scatha's treasure, while Fram himself was not killed by Dwarves, but by the servants of the Enemy who made it look like Dwarves were involved to sow dissent in the North. Fram left three sons, Gifica, Gundamári and Gisilhári. None of them were at age at the time of Fram's death and the two eldest died in battles against Orcs.\n\n{{references}}\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n| race=northmen}}\n{{seq\n| prev=[[Frumgar]]\n| list=[[Lord of the Éothéod]]\n| nvac=Unknown\n| next=eventually [[Léod]]\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n[[Category:Éothéod]]\n[[Category:Lords of the Éothéod]]\n[[Category:Old English names]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[de:Fram]]\n[[fi:Fram]]"}}}
