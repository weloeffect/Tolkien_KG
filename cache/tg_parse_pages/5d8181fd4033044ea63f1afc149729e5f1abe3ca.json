From there they brought tidings that those lands were under [[Melkor]]'s shadow. Thus many Valar wished to make war on Melkor, especially [[Tulkas]]. But [[Mandos]] warned them in name of [[Manwë]] that they could not make war because the [[Firstborn]] were coming in that age. Then [[Varda]] prepared the world by placing new and more powerful [[stars]] in the sky to guide the [[Elves]] in the darkness of Middle-earth. Under the new lights, the Elves awoke at [[Cuiviénen]], but this only became known to the Valar after Oromë came upon them by chance.\n\nIn Cuiviénen the Elves invented [[languages]] and lived in peace, but they were also tormented by Melkor, who sent [[Hunter and Rider|evil creatures]] to plague them and instilled in their hearts fears of the [[Hunter and Rider|Rider]]. It is said that he also captured many Elves in [[Utumno]], and corrupted, them creating [[Orcs]] in mockery of the Elves. This was said to be the most evil deed of Melkor. \n\nReturning from Middle-earth, Oromë told the Valar of the Elves, and of the shadows that troubled them. Then the Valar went to war against Melkor in the [[Battle of the Powers]], in which the Elves heard a great shaking and were worried but did not take part in the battle. After many battles, Melkor was found cowering in the depths of Utumno, and [[Aulë]] wrought the chain [[Angainor]] to keep him in captivity. He was [[Chaining of Melkor|chained]] by Tulkas and imprisoned in the [[Halls of Mandos]]. However, many of Melkor's servants escaped and hid in [[Angband]], and [[Sauron]] was among these.\n\nThe Valar sent Oromë to call the Elves to [[Valinor]], and he choose [[Ingwë]], [[Finwë]] and [[Elwë]] as ambassadors, because many Elves did not trust the Valar. The three ambassadors told their Kindreds about the [[Light of Valinor]], and the Elves embarked on the journey across Middle-earth, save a few who refused, and became the dark Elves, or the [[Avari]]. Thus began the [[Great Journey]] and the [[Sundering of the Elves]]. While the Elves crossed Middle-earth, many of the [[Teleri]], the the most numerous host, fell off along the way, creating new Elven peoples. The Elves eventually reached [[Beleriand]] by the sea. Here more Teleri stayed, for their love of the ocean, or returned to the forests ([[Sindar]]). On the shores of the [[Great Sea]], Oromë left the Elves to seek the counsel of Manwë. \n\n== Sundering of the Elves ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | QUE | | | | | | | |QUE=[[Quendi]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |,|-|-|-|-|^|-|-|-|-|.| | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | CAL | | | | | | | | MOR | | |CAL=[[Calaquendi]]|MOR=[[Moriquendi]] }}\n{{familytree | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|.| | | |,|-|^|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree | VAN | | NOL | | FAL | | TEL | | AVA | VAN=[[Vanyar]]|NOL=[[Noldor]]|FAL=[[Teleri]]<br />([[Falmari]])|TEL=[[Teleri]]|AVA=[[Avari]]}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://entmoot.tolkientrail.com/showthread.php?t=7291 Chapter discussion at Entmoot.com]\n* [http://forum.barrowdowns.com/showthread.php?t=13391 Chapter discussion at BarrowDowns.com]\n\n[[fr:tolkien/resumes/silm/qs3]]\n[[fi:Haltioiden tulo ja Melkorin vangitseminen (Silmarillion)]]"}}}
