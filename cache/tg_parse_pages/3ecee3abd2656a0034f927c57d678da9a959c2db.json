It was, coincidentally, also the 33rd birthday of his nephew, [[Frodo Baggins]]. \nAnother significant number of the day was the sum of Bilbo and Frodo's years. Added together, the ages of the two equatated to one [[One Gross|gross]]. For that reason, a portion of the party was \"invitation only\" with 144 guests.\n==History==\n===Preparations===\nIn {{TA|2989}}, Bilbo took his orphaned younger cousin, [[Frodo Baggins]], under his wing. The two shared a birthday, and they celebrated with lively parties in [[Bag End]] each year. As the years passed, however, Bilbo began to feel weary (possibly because of his use of [[One Ring|his magic ring]]), and around {{TA|3001}} he decided to leave his homeland [[the Shire]]. Bilbo planned to execute his departure as a mysterious and flashy \"disappearance\", which he would achieve with the help of his aforementioned ring. \n\nThe year came when Bilbo would celebrate his 111st birthday–—in addition to Frodo's coming-of-age——and the old hobbit announced \"a party of special magnificence\", which caused a sensation in the vicinity due to his eccentricity and wealth. Indeed, since {{TA|3000}} he had ordered special gifts from [[Erebor]] and [[Dale]], and [[Dwarves of Erebor]] had started arriving with wagons full of packages. Another stir came when the \"conjurer\" [[Gandalf]], famous for his fireworks in [[Old Took|Gerontius Took]]'s parties years ago, also arrived.\n\nDuring the following days, Bilbo was kept busy writing and sending invitations, managing his list and packaging the gifts. He turned away many curious folk who pretended they came to help, but really were only interested in the goings-on at the famous Bag End. The post-offices of [[Hobbiton]] and [[Bywater]] were overwhelmed by the number of invitations and responses, and his catering from miles around [[Hobbiton]] had depleted the stocks of most storerooms and storehouses.\n\nIn the days leading up to the party the [[Party Field|large field]] in front of Bag End was repurposed for the needs of the feast; ropes, poles, lanterns, tents, pavilions and a new gate to connect the field to the road were all constructed.<ref name=\"Party\">{{FR|Party}}</ref>\n\n===Party===\n[[File:Inger Edelfeldt - A Long Expected Party.jpg|thumb|''A Long Expected Party'' by [[:Category:Images by Inger Edelfeldt|Inger Edelfeldt]]]]\nIt was a huge and expensive celebration, attended by most hobbits in the area.  Bilbo welcomed the attendees in person at the new white gate, handing out a present to each visitor——though some secretly exited by a back way and came in again by the gate to get a second gift.\n\nPlenty of eating and drinking followed, as was customary for Hobbits. Moreover, there was music, as well as songs and dances. Many children came by parental permission (this permission was easy to aquire——especially since they were fed a free meal). At lunch and [[tea]] the guests sat to eat together. Finally, at six-thirty, Gandalf began a show with all kinds of fireworks. The last one was designed and made especially to honor Bilbo: a figure of a mountain which spouted a lifelike [[fire-drake]] that roared and whizzed three times over the crowd before flying and exploding above Bywater. And that was the signal for the supper.\n[[File:Miriam Ellis - The Springle-ring.jpg|thumb|left|''The Springle-ring'' by [[:Category:Images by Miriam Ellis|Miriam Ellis]]]]\nAfter the last meal, Bilbo began giving his inevitable and much-dreaded [[Bilbo’s Birthday Speech|speech]], but the guests were already satisfied and full of good food and good drink, and they felt they could tolerate anything, cheering with every word. As Bilbo began his speech, talking about his age and thanking them for coming, they thought he had said what was necessary and started playing with the musical crackers and dancing the [[springle-ring]]. Bilbo blew a horn in order to silence them. Then he revealed to them that they were there for three reasons: to tell them that he was fond of them, to celebrate the birthdays of Frodo and himself, and to say farewell as this would be \"the end.\"\n\nThen, suddenly, Bilbo disappeared (he used the [[The One Ring|Ring]] for that effect, and Gandalf improvised a flash). The old hobbit then passed behind the surprised guests, who were mumbling and gossipping and seeking comfort in more food, and returned to Bag End. He was joined there by Gandalf, and the wizard persuaded him to leave the Ring in Frodo's keeping, after which Bilbo departed for the east<ref name=\"Party\"/> with [[Nar (companion of Bilbo)|three]] [[Anar (dwarf)|Dwarf]] [[Hannar|companions]].<ref>{{RS|Return}}</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\nAs the host's heir, Frodo had the duty of comforting the shocked guests and feeding them well. Around midnight, carriages came to take the important guests home, and those who were too drunk or heavy were taken by gardeners on wheelbarrows.\n\nThe [[23 September|next day]], workers were ordered to clean up the [[Party Field]]. The installations, the decoration, the leftover food, the dishes and forgotten items like bags, gloves and handkerchiefs. The news of Bilbo's prank alarmed everyone, and Bag End was flooded by the guests, who demanded a logical explanation and to collect the presents Bilbo left for them.\n\nThe guests were so full that the next weeks there were almost no purchases of provisions throughout the district.\n==Attendees==\n[[File:LOTR 1990-2--1-.png|thumb|Bilbo's party in the [[J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I (1990 video game)|The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I]].]]\nEveryone around Hobbiton and Bywater was invited, even from Buckland. Some were distant relatives living in faraway parts of the Shire. A few were overlooked by accident, but they came anyway.\n\nA select 144 from the extended families of Bilbo and Frodo (including Gandalf and other special guests) joined the exclusive family dinner-party, held in the great pavilion by the Tree.\n:''In alphabetical order:''\n* [[Adelard Took]] and daughters<ref name=\"Took\"/>\n* [[Angelica Baggins]]<ref name=\"Baggins\"/>\n* [[Asphodel Brandybuck|Asphodel Burrows]]<ref name=\"Brandybuck\"/>\n* [[Berilac Brandybuck]]<ref name=\"Brandybuck\"/>\n* [[Bruno Bracegirdle]]<ref name=\"Boffin\"/>\n* [[Celandine Brandybuck]]<ref name=\"Brandybuck\"/>\n* [[Daisy Baggins|Daisy Boffin]]<ref name=\"Baggins\"/>\n* [[Dinodas Brandybuck]]<ref name=\"Brandybuck\"/>\n* [[Doderic Brandybuck]]<ref name=\"Brandybuck\"/>\n* [[Dora Baggins]]<ref name=\"Baggins\"/>\n* [[Dudo Baggins]]<ref name=\"Baggins\"/>\n* [[Eglantine Banks|Eglantine Took]]<ref name=\"Took\"/>\n* [[Esmeralda Took|Esmeralda Brandybuck]]<ref name=\"Took\"/>\n* [[Estella Bolger]]<ref name=\"Took\"/>\n* [[Everard Took]]<ref name=\"Took\"/>\n* [[Ferdibrand Took]]<ref name=\"Took\"/>\n* [[Ferdinand Took]]<ref name=\"Took\"/>\n* [[Thain]] [[Ferumbras Took III]]<ref name=\"Took\">{{App|Took}}</ref>\n* [[Filibert Bolger]]<ref name=\"Baggins\"/>\n* [[Folco Boffin]]<ref name=\"Boffin\"/>\n* [[Fredegar Bolger]]<ref name=\"Took\"/>\n* [[Frodo Baggins]]<ref name=\"Baggins\"/>\n* [[Gandalf]]<ref name=\"Party\">{{FR|Party}}</ref>\n* [[Gerda Boffin|Gerda Bolger]]<ref name=\"Boffin\"/>\n* [[Gilly Brownlock|Gilly Baggins]]<ref name=\"Baggins\"/>\n* [[Griffo Boffin]]<ref name=\"Baggins\"/>\n* [[Heribald Bolger]]<ref name=\"Bolger\"/>\n* [[Hilda Bracegirdle|Hilda Brandybuck]]<ref name=\"Brandybuck\"/>\n* [[Hugo Bracegirdle]]<ref name=\"Boffin\"/>\n* [[Ilberic Brandybuck]]<ref name=\"Brandybuck\"/>\n* [[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins]]<ref name=\"Baggins\"/>\n* [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]]<ref name=\"Baggins\"/>\n* [[Marmadas Brandybuck]]<ref name=\"Brandybuck\"/>\n* [[Melilot Brandybuck]]<ref name=\"Brandybuck\"/>\n* [[Mentha Brandybuck]]<ref name=\"Brandybuck\"/>\n* [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]]<ref name=\"Brandybuck\"/>\n* [[Merimac Brandybuck]]<ref name=\"Brandybuck\"/>\n* [[Merimas Brandybuck]]<ref name=\"Brandybuck\"/>\n* [[Milo Burrows]]<ref name=\"Baggins\"/>\n* [[Minto Burrows]]<ref name=\"Baggins\"/>\n* [[Moro Burrows]]<ref name=\"Baggins\"/>\n* [[Mosco Burrows]]<ref name=\"Baggins\"/>\n* [[Myrtle Burrows]]<ref name=\"Baggins\"/>\n* [[Nora Bolger]]<ref name=\"Bolger\"/>\n* [[Odo Proudfoot]]<ref name=\"Baggins\"/>\n* [[Odovacar Bolger]]<ref name=\"Took\"/>\n* [[Olo Proudfoot]]<ref name=\"Baggins\"/>\n* [[Otho Sackville-Baggins]]<ref name=\"Baggins\">{{App|Baggins}}</ref>\n* [[Paladin Took II]]<ref name=\"Took\"/>\n* [[Pearl Took]]<ref name=\"Took\"/> \n* [[Peony Baggins|Peony Burrows]]<ref name=\"Baggins\"/>\n* [[Peregrin Took]]<ref name=\"Took\"/>\n* [[Pervinca Took]]<ref name=\"Took\"/>\n* [[Pimpernel Took]]<ref name=\"Took\"/>\n* [[Ponto Baggins II|Ponto Baggins]]<ref name=\"Baggins\"/>\n* [[Poppy Chubb-Baggins|Poppy Bolger]]<ref name=\"Baggins\"/>\n* [[Porto Baggins]]<ref name=\"Baggins\"/>\n* [[Prisca Baggins|Prisca Bolger]]<ref name=\"Baggins\"/>\n* [[Reginard Took]]<ref name=\"Took\"/>\n* [[Master of Buckland|Master]] [[Rorimac Brandybuck]]<ref name=\"Brandybuck\">{{App|Brandybuck}}</ref>\n* [[Rosamunda Took|Rosamunda Bolger]]<ref name=\"Took\"/>\n* [[Rufus Burrows]]<ref name=\"Brandybuck\"/>\n* [[Sancho Proudfoot]]<ref name=\"Baggins\"/>\n* [[Saradas Brandybuck]]<ref name=\"Brandybuck\"/>\n* [[Saradoc Brandybuck]]<ref name=\"Took\"/><ref name=\"Brandybuck\"/>\n* [[Seredic Brandybuck]]<ref name=\"Brandybuck\"/>\n* [[Tosto Boffin]]<ref name=\"Boffin\"/>\n* [[Vigo Boffin]]<ref name=\"Boffin\">{{App|Boffin}}</ref>\n* [[Wilimar Bolger]]<ref name=\"Bolger\">{{App|Bolger}}</ref>\n* The 3 daughters of [[Adalgrim Took]]<ref name=\"Took\"/> (possibly)<ref group=note>They are marked as guests in older editions of the [[Appendix C]], but unmarked in later editions; not known if it is a typographical error or a correction.</ref>\n* Various [[Goodbody Family|Goodbodies]],<ref name=\"Baggins\"/> [[Hornblower Family|Hornblowers]], [[Brockhouse Family|Brockhousess]], [[Grubb Family|Grubbs]] (relatives of [[Laura Grubb|Bilbo's grandmother]]), [[Chubb Family|Chubbs]] (relatives of [[Adamanta Chubb|his other grandmother]].<ref name=\"Party\"/>\n\n{{references|n}}\n[[Category:Festivals and feasts]]\n[[Category:Third Age]]\n[[de:Bilbos Abschiedsfest]]\n[[fi:Bilbon jäähyväisjuhla]]"}}}
