They escaped through [[Idril's secret way]], a tunnel that led to [[Tumladen]]. Thanks to the burning of the fountains and the city of [[Gondolin]], they were covered in fume and mists, so they could cross the plain unnoticed. \n\nThe group ran to [[Cirith Thoronath]], where [[Glorfindel]] killed the Balrog, saving them. Then they passed over the mountains, reaching the [[Sirion]] river, which they followed south. After many dangers, they came to [[Nan-tathren]], and they could rest there for a while, healing their wounds, but not their sorrow.\n\nFinally, they continued their way to the [[Sea]], finding refuge in the [[Havens of Sirion]], along with the people of [[Elwing]].<ref>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn the [[The Book of Lost Tales|Lost Tale]] of \"[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]\", the escape and wanderings of the Exiles is told with more detail than any other version. Those who escaped the city and reached the [[Eagles' Cleft]] were counted as a nigh eight hundreds. But in their wanderings suffered attacks and diseases, so when they reach the Land of Willows years later they were less: including children, three hundred and twenty men, and two hundred sixty women. When they moved to the mouths of Sirion, they took the name of '''''Lothlim''''' (\"People of the Flower\"), as the name Gondothlim saddened their hearts.<ref>{{LT2|III}}, p. 196</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Gondolindrim]]"}}}
