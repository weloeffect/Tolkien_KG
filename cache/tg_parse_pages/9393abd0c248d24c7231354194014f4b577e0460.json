Tolkien''''' is a lecture comparing [[Wikipedia:Robert Browning|Robert Browning]] and [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], published in the series ''University of Chester Inaugural and Professorial Lectures''. \n\n==From the publisher==\n\n'''Product Description'''\n\nThis lecture consists of a comparative examination of the lives and works of two writers, Browning and Tolkien, who make an unlikely pair. The differences are many and the similarities are not immediately obvious. Aspects considered include their experiences of marriage, their voluminousness, their reputations amongst their readers, their different aesthetics, and their religious beliefs, particular as these are reflected in their attitudes towards death.\n\n'''About the Author'''\n\nChris Walsh is Dean of Humanities and Professor of English Literature at the University of Chester. He has published widely on nineteenth- and twentieth-century fiction and poetry. His publications include: ''Studying Literature: A Practical Introduction'', with Graham Atkin and Susan Watkins (Harvester Wheatsheaf, 1995), ''A Reader s Guide to the Poetry of Robert Browning'' (Chester College of Higher Education, 1996), and ''The Practice of Reading: Interpreting the Novel'', with Derek Alsop (Macmillan, 1999).
