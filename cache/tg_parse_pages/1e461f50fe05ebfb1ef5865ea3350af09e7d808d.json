She made statues so lifelike that people thought they were real at first, and if they did not know her art, tried to speak to them.<ref name=nerdanel>{{S|Feanor}}</ref> She also created sculptures from her own imaginings, which were \"strong and strange but beautiful.\"<ref name=Feanor/> In her youth, Nerdanel loved to wander along the shore or in the hills of [[Aman]]. Whilst wandering, she met Fëanor, and they \"were companions in many journeys.\"<ref name=Feanor>{{MR|P3II5}}</ref>\n\nWhen Nerdanel married Fëanor, others wondered at his choice for she was not considered among \"the fairest of her people.\"<ref name=Feanor/>{{rp|272}} For a time, since Fëanor would seek the counsel of none save her, she was able to influence and restrain her prideful husband.<ref name=nerdanel/> \n===Marriage and motherhood===\nNerdanel bore Fëanor [[Sons of Fëanor|seven sons]]: [[Maedhros]], [[Maglor]], [[Celegorm]], [[Caranthir]], [[Curufin]], [[Amrod]], and [[Amras]]. Elves typically have four children or fewer, so the size of their family was particularly noteworthy.<ref name=NotesB>{{MR|P3II3e}}</ref>{{rp|Note 4}} Some inherited her colors, others inherited her character and patience.\n\nWhen Fëanor was banished from [[Túna]] for drawing a sword against [[Fingolfin|his brother]], Nerdanel asked for leave to abide with [[Indis]] during that time.<ref name=Unrest>{{MR|P3II6}}</ref>{{rp|279}}\n\nHowever, Fëanor's later deeds deeply grieved her and in the end they became estranged from one another.<ref name=nerdanel/>\n\nWhen Nerdanel, who had since returned to her father's house, learned that her husband and sons were planning to go into exile to [[Middle-earth]], she begged Fëanor to leave with her their youngest sons, Amrod and Amras, or at least one of them. Fëanor's response was that, if she would not follow him, she was an untrue wife for deserting both her husband and her children.<ref name=Feanor/>{{rp|354}} \n\nRegardless, Nerdanel refused to follow because she heeded the warning of Aulë that: \"'It [the rebellion] will in the end only lead Fëanor and all your children to death.'\"<ref name=Feanor/> As predicted she lost all her children in Middle-earth.<ref name=nerdanel/><ref>{{S|24}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nKnown as '''the wise''', she was strong, free of mind, and filled with the desire for knowledge.<ref name=Feanor/> Though she was strong-willed, she was more patient than her husband. She would seek to understand others instead of master them. Her calmer temperament had passed to some of her sons while others were fiery more like their father.<ref name=nerdanel/>\n\nNerdanel is noted as having brown hair and a ruddy complexion,<ref name=VT41>{{VT|41b}}, p. 9</ref> and not considered among \"the fairest of her people.\"<ref name=Feanor/>{{rp|272}} Her father was noted for having hair that was not as dark or black as was that of most of the Noldor, but brown, and had glints of coppery-red in it; three of Nerdanel's children—Maedhros, Amrod, and Amras—had hair of this kind.<ref name=Sons>{{PM|Feanor}}, p. 353</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Nerdanel'' is [[Quenya]], but it is given no clear meaning or etymology in the published writings of Tolkien. \n\nEditor and linguist [[Patrick H. Wynne]] has suggested that the element ''nerd-'' in ''Nerdanel'' perhaps derives from ''nerdo'' (\"large, strong man\"), noting that the name \"''might refer to her strength of body and mind, and her pursuits of crafts more commonly practiced by men.''\" Wynne also suggests that ''Istarnië'' derives from Quenya ''[[ista-]]'' (\"know\"), apparently \"''referring to her 'desire for knowledge'''\".<ref>{{VT|47a}}, p. 33-4</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| MHT | | MIR |y| FIN |y| IND | | | | | | | | | | | | |MHT=[[Mahtan]]<br/><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>| MIR=[[Míriel]]<br/><small>''d. {{YT|1170}}''</small>|FIN=[[Finwë]]<br/><small>''d. {{YT|1495}}''</small>|IND=[[Indis]]<br/><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| |!| | | | | |!| | | |)|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| | | |}}\n{{familytree| NRD |~|y|~| FEA | | FDS | | FNG | | IRM | | FRF | | |NRD='''NERDANEL'''<br/><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|FEA=[[Fëanor]]<br/><small>''{{YT|1169}} - {{YT|1497|n}}''</small>|FDS=[[Findis]]<br/><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|FNG=[[Fingolfin]]<br/><small>''{{YT|1190}} - {{FA|456}}''</small>|IRM=[[Írimë]]<br/><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|FRF=[[Finarfin]]<br/><small>''b. {{YT|1230}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| |,|-|-|^|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree| MDH | | MAG | | CEL | | CAR | | CUR | | AMD | | AMR |MDH=[[Maedhros]]<br/><small>''d. {{FA|587}}''</small>|MAG=[[Maglor]]<br/><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|CEL=[[Celegorm]]<br/><small>''d. {{FA|506}}''</small>|CAR=[[Caranthir]]<br/><small>''d. {{FA|506}}''</small>|CUR=[[Curufin]]<br/><small>''d. {{FA|506}}''</small>|AMD=[[Amrod]]<br/><small>''d. {{FA|538}}''</small>|AMR=[[Amras]]<br/><small>''d. {{FA|538}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | CLB | | | | | | | | |CLB=[[Celebrimbor]]<br/><small>''d. {{SA|1697}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nThe original (rejected) version of her name was ''Istarnië''.<ref name=Feanor/>{{rp|273}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.silmarillionwritersguild.org/reference/references/nerdanel.php A Woman in Few Words: The Character of Nerdanel and Her Treatment in Canon and Fandom], by Dawn Felagund\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Calaquendi]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Noldor]]\n[[Category:Quenya names]]\n[[de:Nerdanel]]\n[[fi:Nerdanel]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/elfes/noldor/nerdanel]]"}}}
