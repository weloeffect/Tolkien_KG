While [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and his friends stayed at Tom's house, Fatty became friends with their ponies, who Tom later named [[Sharp-ears]], [[Bumpkin]], [[Wise-nose]], [[Swish-tail]], and [[White-socks]].\n\nAfter encountering a [[Barrow-wights|Barrow-wight]], the hobbits' ponies became so frightened that they ran off to find Fatty. Tom called them all back with the names he had given them, and he rode on Fatty Lumpkin alongside the hobbits and their ponies until reaching the borders of his country.<ref>{{FR|Bombadil}}</ref> \n\nAfter the hobbits' ponies escaped from [[Bree]], they ran out again in the Downs to find Fatty. They stayed with Tom for a while, until he had heard news of the events at Bree.<ref>{{RK|Homeward}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] notes that ''-kin'' is in this name used as a diminutive suffix.<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 757</ref>\n\n==Pop Culture==\nIn Pinky and the Brain episode Brainania, Pinky and the Brain travel on a ship named \"SS Fatty Lumpkin.\"\n\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Horses]]\n[[de:Dickes Plumpel]]\n[[fi:Möykky]]"}}}
