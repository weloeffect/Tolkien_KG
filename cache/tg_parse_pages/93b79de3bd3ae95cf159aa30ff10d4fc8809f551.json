During the [[Flight of the Noldor]], Fingolfin led the hosts that refused to accept his half-brother [[Fëanor]] as their king and were forced to cross the [[Helcaraxë]]. In [[Beleriand]], he became the first [[High King of the Noldor]] and, along with [[House of Fingolfin|his children]], he helped to keep the [[Siege of Angband]] against the forces of [[Morgoth]]. He is renowned for his valiant death in single combat with Morgoth at the end of the [[Dagor Bragollach]].\n\n==History==\n===Early life===\nHaving different mothers, he and his older half-brother Fëanor never felt a close bond with each other. This lack of affinity developed into rivalry when [[Morgoth|Melkor]] secretly told each of them that the other was planning on driving them out of [[Tirion]].\n\nDuring the days of the [[Two Trees of Valinor|Two Trees]] in [[Valinor]], as Melkor's lies were taking root in the minds of the Noldor, a number of the Noldor started to believe that the [[Valar]] were somehow restraining them from going back to [[Cuiviénen]] in Middle-earth. Melkor's cunning had caused the suspicions he sowed to outweigh the Noldor's knowledge that the greatest Gift of the Valar was total free will.\n\n===Unrest of the Noldor===\n{{quote|King and father, wilt thou not restrain the pride of our brother, Curufinwë, who is called the Spirit of Fire, all too truly? By what right does he speak for all our people, as if he were King? Thou it was who long ago spoke before the Quendi, bidding them accept the summons of the Valar to Aman. Thou it was that led the Noldor upon the long road through the perils of Middle-earth to the light of Eldamar. If thou dost not now repent of it, two sons at least thou hast to honour thy words.|Fingolfin to Finwë, {{S|Unrest}}}}\n[[File:Tuuliky - Half Brothers.jpg|thumb|left|''Half Brothers'' by [[:Category:Images by Tuuliky|Tuuliky]]]]\nFëanor was the first to speak against the Valar, and [[Finwë]] summoned all of the lords of his house to resolve the issue. As Fingolfin was contending with his father to convince him to restrain Fëanor, the latter arrived fully armed with weapons he had secretly forged. Even though Fingolfin accepted him as his senior, Fëanor threatened Fingolfin, who was unarmed, with his sword, after which Fingolfin bowed to his father Finwë and left, only to be followed by Fëanor and threatened again in public. This threat, in the main square in front of the Mindon, King Finwë's seat, was witnessed by many as Fëanor drew his sword and placed the point to Fingolfin's breast. In the face of this public humiliation, Fingolfin turned quietly and walked away without a word to Fëanor, in an effort to avoid division and dissension within his father's House and among the Noldor.<ref name=\"Unrest\">{{S|Unrest}}</ref> \n\nFollowing Fëanor's threat to Fingolfin, Fëanor was banished from Tirion for twelve years by the Valar; Finwë chose to follow Fëanor, self-banishing himself as well.<ref name=\"Unrest\"/> The rule of the Noldor was then committed to Fingolfin by Manwë and Fingolfin, who had up to this point been generally known by his [[mother-name]], took the name of ''Finwë''.<ref name=\"MR22\">{{MR|P3II3e}}, note 22</ref>\n\nAfter the escape of Melkor from Valinor, during the feast Manwë held for the reconciliation of the Eldar, Fingolfin publicly forgave Fëanor and called him \"Half-brother in blood, full brother in heart\".<ref>{{S|Darkening}}</ref>\n\n===Journey to Middle-earth===\n{{quote|I have not rejected the Valar, nor their authority in all matters where it is just for them to use it. But if the Eldar were given free choice to leave Middle-earth and go to Aman, and accepted it because of the loveliness and bliss of that land, their free choice to leave it and return to Middle-earth, when it has become dark and desecrated, cannot be taken away. Moreover I have an errand in Middle-earth, the avenging of the blood of my father upon Morgoth, whom the Valar let loose among us. Fëanor seeks first his stolen treasures.|Fingolfin, ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', \"[[Shibboleth of Fëanor]]\"}}\n[[File:Elena Kukanova - Middle Earth.jpg|thumb|left|''Middle-earth'' by [[Elena Kukanova]]]]\nAfter King Finwë died, murdered by Morgoth, Fëanor rallied up the Noldor and gave a [[Speech of Fëanor|passionate speech]] which concluded with his [[Oath of Fëanor|blasphemous oath]]. While Fingolfin spoke against Fëanor, and fierce words awoke that nearly came to violence, in the end nearly all of the Noldor chose to follow him to [[Exile of the Noldor|Exile]].<ref name=\"Flight\">{{S|Flight}}</ref> \n\nFingolfin led the largest host of the Noldor that departed [[Aman]] for [[Middle-earth]]. Though against his wisdom,<ref name=\"Flight\" /> Fingolfin joined with full will in the rebellion and the exile,<ref name=Case>{{PM|Case}}, p. 336</ref> desiring to go to Middle-earth in order to avenge the murder of Finwë upon Morgoth.<ref name=\"PM|XINotes\">{{PM|XINotes}}, note 33</ref> Additional reasons were that his son Fingon urged him, he would not be sundered from his people that were eager to go, nor leave them to the rash counsels of Fëanor, and he did not forget his words before the throne of Manwë.<ref name=\"Flight\"/>\n\nAs days passed in their exile, more and more of the Noldor started speaking against Fëanor, for their journey was difficult, and they feared the prophecy of [[Mandos]]. After Fëanor's Noldor acquired the ships of the [[Teleri]] following the [[First Kinslaying]], Fëanor and his followers used them to sail across the sea. Fëanor burned the ships after reaching Middle-earth, stranding the others, for he thought the followers of Fingolfin would prove to be useless.<ref name=\"Flight\" />\n\nFingolfin and his people saw the smoke of the ships from afar, and chose to travel through the icy Helcaraxë, for they were ashamed to go back to Valinor, and were angry at Fëanor. The journey was hard and many died, yet they were filled with hope when they saw the Moon for the first time. Soon after, at the rising of the Sun, he came to the [[Gates of Angband]] and smote upon them, but [[Morgoth]] stayed hidden inside. Fingolfin and the Noldor, realizing they could not be victorious in this way, then came to the northern shores of [[Lake Mithrim]], from which the Fëanorian part of the host had withdrawn.<ref name=\"Return\">{{S|Return}}</ref>\n\n===Rule in Beleriand===\nShortly after Fëanor's death, his oldest son Maedhros was captured by Morgoth. Learning this, Fingolfin's oldest son [[Fingon]] rescued [[Maedhros]], with whom he was a good friend. At a subsequent [[council in Mithrim]], Fingolfin was chosen to be the first [[High King of the Noldor]] in [[Middle-earth]], with Maedhros waiving his claim. Fingolfin ruled from [[Hithlum]], by the northern shores of [[Lake Mithrim]].<ref name=\"Return\"/> After defeating the [[Orcs]] in the [[Dagor Aglareb]] (\"Glorious Battle\") in {{FA|60}}, Fingolfin helped to maintain the [[Siege of Angband]] for nearly four hundred years. \n\nAs High King, Fingolfin maintained amicable relations between various factions within Beleriand. He acknowledged the high-kingship of Thingol over the Sindar in Beleriand,<ref>{{WJ|Author}}, note 11</ref> and conversely, even after learning of the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë]] and banning the use of [[Quenya]], Thingol kept friendship with Fingolfin and his folk.<ref>{{GA|105}}</ref> When [[Men]] arrived in Beleriand they became allied to the Noldor, and added to their strength.<ref name=\"Ruin\">{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> Notable among these men was [[Hador]], who entered the house of Fingolfin in {{FA|405}}, and who Fingolfin made the first [[Lord of Dor-lómin]] in {{FA|416}}.<ref>{{WJ|14}}, §31, p. 228</ref>\n\nIn {{FA|422}}, seeing that his people were become numerous and strong, and that the Men were many and valiant, Fingolfin pondered an assault upon Angband as he knew that they lived in danger while Morgoth was free to labour and devise evils that none could foretell until revealed. Most of the Noldor were little disposed to hearken to Fingolfin though; they were content with things as they were, trusting them to last, and thus slow to begin an assault where many would surely perish. Fingolfin's designs for an assault therefore came to naught.<ref name=\"Ruin\"/><ref>{{GA|133}}</ref>\n\n=== Battle of Sudden Flame and the Fall of Fingolfin ===\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Morgoth and the High King of Noldor (1992).jpg|thumb|''Morgoth and the High King of Noldor'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nIn {{FA|455}},<ref>{{GA|147}}</ref> the Siege was ended by the sudden assault of Morgoth in the [[Dagor Bragollach]] (\"Battle of Sudden Flame\"). The realm of [[Dorthonion]] was first hit, and the sons of Finarfin who held it, [[Angrod]] and [[Aegnor]], were slain. Fingolfin and Fingon marched from Hithlum to their aid, but were driven back with great loss to the fortresses of [[Ered Wethrin]], and these they hardly defended against the Orcs. Fingolfin's vassal Hador, along with Hador's younger son [[Gundor]], fell defending his rearguard at [[Eithel Sirion]].<ref name=\"Ruin\"/> \n\nSundered from his kinsmen, and seeing what he believed to be the ruin of his people, Fingolfin rode to Angband in wrath and despair and [[Fall of Fingolfin|fell to Morgoth after challenging him to single combat]]. During the battle Fingolfin wounded Morgoth seven times, and managed one last stab to Morgoth's foot before his death; wounds that would never fully heal. Before Morgoth could feed Fingolfin to his [[wolves]], Fingolfin's body was rescued by [[Thorondor]], the King of Eagles, and brought to a mountaintop overlooking [[Gondolin]] where [[Turgon]] built a [[Fingolfin's Cairn|cairn]] over the remains of his father.<ref name=\"Ruin\"/>\n\n[[Fingon]] succeeded him as the [[High King of the Noldor]].\n\n== Characteristics ==\nFingolfin was the strongest and most valiant of the sons of Finwë.<ref>{{S|5}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Ancient Quenya]] of Aman, the spirant '''s'''' became voiced as '''z''' when between vowels. While this was retained in [[Vanyarin]], it was rhotacized in Noldorin, eventually becoming '''r'''. Due to the prestige of the Vanyar, this was change resisted by some of the Noldor (especially those hostile to Fëanor) and the children of Indis. The continued use of the Vanyar (z) pronunciation by the children of Indis, however, was not liked by the general people, even among many who were faithful to Fingolfin & Finarfin and against Fëanor.<ref>{{PE|OP2}}</ref> \n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Fingolfin.mp3|Ardamir}}\nThe name ''Fingolfin'' is [[Sindarin]], but it is never glossed, although it is said that it is the [[Sindarized]] form of the name ''Finwë Ñolofinwë'' (\"Wise Finwë\").<ref name=\"Finwe\">{{PM|Finwe}}, pp. 344-5</ref>\n\nHowever, in the [[Noldorin]] phase of the language, ''Fingolfin'' is given as \"Magical Skill\".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry \"PHIN\"</ref> In later versions, [[Tolkien]] considered changing the name to ''Ingolfin'', as coming from ''[[Ingoldo]]'', but the idea was soon discarded.<ref name=\"Eldarin\">{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 118</ref>\n\n==Other names==\nHis [[father-name]] was '''''Ñolofinwë''''', with the stem [[NGOL|''ñolo'']] (related to \"wisdom\") attached to the name of his father. Later, during the Exile of the Noldor, Fingolfin added ''Finwë'' to the beginning of this name, in pursuance of his claim to be [[King of the Noldor]] after his father's death.<ref name=\"Finwe\"/> This would result in '''''Finwë·ñolofinwë'''''.<ref name=\"Eldarin\"/>\n\nHis [[Amilessë|mother-name]] was '''''[[Aracáno]]''''' (\"High Chieftain\"), and was held to be ‘prophetic’.<ref name=\"PM|XINotes\"/> He further gave this name to his son [[Argon]].<ref>{{PM|XINotes}}, p. 360. Cf. also p. 345</ref> \n\nAfter Fëanor and Finwë's banishment, a title he was known by was '''''Vinya Finwë''''' (\"Young / new Finwë\").<ref name=Eldarin/><ref group=note>In both [[Morgoth's Ring]] and [[Parma Eldalamberon 17]] it is stated that he was also known as '''''Ingoldo Finwë''''', with ''Ingoldo'' being his mother-name  before being changed by Tolkien. There is no known use of '''''Aracáno Finwë'''''</ref>\n\nEarlier titles in [[Noldorin]] were '''''Aran Chithlum''''' (\"King of Hithlum\") and '''''Taur Egledhrim''''' (\"King of the Exiles\").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry \"TĀ\"</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n[[File:J.R.R.
