The scene then returns to [[Elrond]] and Arwen in [[Rivendell]]. She urges him to reforge Narsil, but he refuses. Arwen sits down, and drops her book. Elrond takes her hands and notices they are cold. \"The life of the [[Eldar]] is leaving you,\" he says, looking worried and surprised. Arwen replies, \"This was my choice. Ada... Whether by your will or not, there is no ship now that can bear me hence.\"\n\nThis finally moves Elrond to order the reforging of Narsil, and give the Race of [[Men]] a second chance. He oversees the reforging with the scene cutting from his face to the reforging. The scene ends with the sword's final forging. \n\n==Differences==\n*Elrond had foresaw that Narsil would only be reforged when the One Ring was found, and [[Sauron]] had returned. During [[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'s time in [[Rivendell]], Elrond had ordered Narsil to be reforged for [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]], so when the Company set out from [[Imladris]], Aragorn already had the sword.<ref>{{FR|Council}}, pp. 276-7</ref>\n\n{{references|notes}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King scenes|10]]"}}}
