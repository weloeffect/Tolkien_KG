This version of the map is printed in ''[[The Fall of Númenor]]'', with [[Glanduin]] and [[Swanfleet]] being erroneously applied to the upper course of the [[Isen]].<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. lxvi</ref>\n\nThe [[The West of Middle-earth at the End of the Third Age|map was re-drawn]] in [[1980]] by Christopher and has been since included in editions after the year.\n\n==Errors==\nChristopher Tolkien admitted that there were both \"minor\" and \"major defects\" and oddities, and while his father used the map as the basis of his writing, he often noted its inadequacies. In the long term, Christopher regretted that his father did not proceed to make a better map of his own.<ref name=\"intro\" />\n\nSome of the errors include:\n*The main name of [[Harondor]] appears as \"South Gondor\" which is the translation of the actual name.<ref name=\"rc\" />\n*The [[Misty Mountains]] were written as \"Hithaiglin\" in the original map, which was corrected to \"Hithaeglir\" in more recent maps.<ref name=\"rc\">{{HM|RC}}, p. lxiii</ref>\n*[[Nan Curunir]] is spelt as \"Nan '''G'''urunir\", representing an earlier version of the writing.<ref name=\"rc\" />\n*The small mountainous range north of [[Hollin]] shouldn't be actually mountains but rather \"an ever wider land of bleak hills, and deep valleys filled with turbulent water\".<ref name=\"rc\" /><ref>{{RS|4XXIVG}}, p. 441</ref>\n*Of former [[Arnor]] only the region of [[Rhudaur]] is named, oddly omitting [[Arthedain]] and [[Cardolan]].<ref name=\"intro\" />\n*The map suggests that the [[Icebay of Forochel]] is the small gulf north of [[Eriador]]. C. Tolkien realised that the name rather refers to the immense region of sea surrounded by the Cape of [[Forochel]].<ref name=\"intro\" /><ref name=\"rc\" />\n*[[Forodwaith (disambiguation)|Forodwaith]] is labelled as being a part of the wider [[Northern Waste]], if not a separate region. C. Tolkien later became sure that the two are synonymous.<ref name=\"intro\" />\n*The portion of the [[East Road]] between the [[Weathertop]] to the [[Ford of Bruinen]] was supposed to have two big curves, which were not depicted in the final map, creating a discrepancy with the text of the First Edition. The text was altered in the later editions in order to be more faithful to the map.<ref>{{RS|1XIa}}</ref>\n\n\n==Annotated copy==\n[[File:The Annotated Map of Middle-earth.jpeg|thumb|The annotated General Map of Middle-earth]]\nA copy of the map with annotations by J.R.R.
