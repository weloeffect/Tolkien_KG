It was held briefly as a fief by the [[House of Bëor]], but lost to [[Morgoth]] in the [[Dagor Bragollach]] (\"Battle of Sudden Flame\").\n\n==History==\nThe region of Ladros seems originally to have been a fief of [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]]: at least, his brothers [[Angrod]] and [[Aegnor]] held \"the northern slopes of Dorthonion\".<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref> Finrod later assigned this land to [[Boromir (Lord of Ladros)|Boromir]] of the House of Bëor, whose members had long been loyal in his service. Boromir became [[Lord of Ladros]].\n\nOf the House of Bëor, there were three lords of Ladros — Boromir himself, his son [[Bregor]], and Bregor's son [[Bregolas]]. In Bregolas' time, Morgoth overwhelmed Dorthonion and Ladros in the [[Dagor Bragollach]], in which Bregolas himself was slain. His brother [[Barahir]] and [[Barahir's outlaws|twelve faithful]] [[Bëorings]] became outlaws in their own land, assaulting Morgoth's forces from their hidden lair at [[Tarn Aeluin]] on Ladros' southern borders. They were betrayed by [[Gorlim the Unhappy]], (who was himself deceived by [[Sauron]] into divulging the Outlaws' whereabouts.) and all were slain but [[Beren]], who escaped into the south. \n\nAfter this time, Ladros fell under the yoke of Morgoth until it was mostly swallowed by the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] at the end of the [[First Age]], with bits of the land surviving as part of [[Tol Fuin]].\n\n==Etymology==\n''Ladros'' is clearly [[Sindarin]], but its meaning is unclear, although it might be a combination of ''[[lad]]'' (\"plain\") + ''[[ros]]'' (\"spray, rain\").<ref>{{HM|GS}}, p. 382</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Beleriand]]\n[[Category:Dorthonion]]\n[[Category:Regions]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[de:Ladros]]\n[[fr:encyclo:geographie:regions:beleriand:ladros]]\n[[fi:Ladros]]"}}}
