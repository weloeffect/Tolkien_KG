Chu graduated from Taiwan's National Central University in [[1998]], with a BS in Electrical Engineering.\n\nWith news of an upcoming [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|live action film series]] about ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' in the late 1990's, Chu approached a local publisher to translate the works for a minimal fee; 9 percent if 10.000 box sets (or 40.000 individual copies) were sold; if not, he donated his services for free. \n\nThe gamble paid off, and Chu became a millionnaire. He donated most of his money to his own organization [http://www.myoops.org/en/ OOPS], translating many educational books into Chinese.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2005/03/06/2003225764 Interview]\n[[Category:Translators|Chu, Lucifer]]\n[[Category:Taiwanese people|Chu, Lucifer]]\n[[Category:People by name|Chu, Lucifer]]\n[[de:Lucifer Chu]]"}}}
