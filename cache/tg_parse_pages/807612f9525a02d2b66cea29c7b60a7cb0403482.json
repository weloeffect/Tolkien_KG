Anderson]] to synchronise its standard ([[1966]]) edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' with the standard British edition of [[Allen and Unwin]], and incorporate additional corrections.<ref name=rc/>\n\nAfter around [[1994]] the editions of ''The Lord of the Rings'' had some new errors introduced by the digitalization process by HarperCollins; some of them had been subsequently corrected, and published by HM in [[2004]].<ref name=rc/>\n\nOn [[16 January]] [[2001]], Houghton Mifflin [http://www.tolkien-movies.com/words/2001/01-16-01e.shtml announced] they had acquired rights to publish books based on [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]].\nThe company combined with parts of '''Harcourt Brace''' in 2007.\n\nIn 2021 HarperCollins purchased the trade book divisions of HMH (including the American Tolkien rights) and in 2022 the remainder\nof the company was purchased by Veritas Capital.\nNew printings of hardcover and trade paperback editions of Tolkien works in America transitioned to William Morrow,\nan imprint of HarperCollins,in 2022.Some Houghton Mifflin copies remain on bookstore shelves until exhausted.\n\n==Publication history==\n*[[21 October]] [[1954]] - ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''\n*[[21 April]] [[1955]] - ''[[The Two Towers]]''\n*[[5 January]] [[1956]] - ''[[The Return of the King]]''\n*[[1966]] - Standard edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'', remaining unchanged thereafter.<ref name=rc/>\n*[[1967]] - Second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings''<ref name=rc/>\n*[[1987]] - Corrected edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'', synchronized with the British edition.<ref name=rc/>\n*[[2004]] - Edition including some corrections introduced by [[Harper Collins]] ten years earlier.<ref name=rc/>\n* [[17 April]] [[2007]] - ''[[The Children of Húrin]]''\n* [[16 May]] [[2007]] - [[The Children of Húrin: Deluxe Edition|''The Children of Húrin'': Deluxe Edition]]\n{{references}}\n==External links==\n*{{WP|Houghton Mifflin Harcourt}}\n*[http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/features/lordoftheringstrilogy/ Official Tolkien site of Houghton Mifflin] ''dead link''\n\n[[Category:American businesses]]\n[[Category:Letter receivers|Hoghton Mifflin]]\n[[Category:Publishers]]\n[[de:Houghton Mifflin]]\n[[fi:Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]"}}}
