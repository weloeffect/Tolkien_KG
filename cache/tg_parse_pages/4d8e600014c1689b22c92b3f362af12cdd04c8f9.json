The website is maintained by Paul Strack and, despite its name, does include all of Tolkien's languages, not only the [[Eldarin]] family.\n\nThe website does not only work as a dictionary, but as a full lexicon that analyzes the relationships between words and the conceptual development of Tolkien's languages through his lifetime. Therefore the invented languages are divided by three periods: Early (1910–30), Middle (1930–50) and Late (1950–73). The entries are extensively sourced. \n\nIt also contains a detailed analysis of the grammar and phonetic development of [[Quenya]], [[Sindarin]] and [[Adûnaic]]. Optionally, a lexicon of commonly used and well accepted [[Neo-Elvish]] vocabulary is included, drawn from [[Helge Fauskanger]]'s ''[https://folk.uib.no/hnohf/nqnt.htm New Testament in Neo-Quenya]'', or the ''[http://www.elvish.org/gwaith/ppq.htm Parma Penyanë Quettaron]'', among others.\n\nNo new Tolkien word were added since the v0.8.6 update (May 2023); among other rare missing sources, the Eldamo lexicon does not include the [[Marquette University|Marquette]] [[Westron]] words published in [[Tyalië Tyelelliéva 17|''Tyalië Tyelelliéva'' 17]] by [[Lisa Star]].<ref>Checked on the 11 March 2024. The lexicon may have been updated since.</ref>\n\nIts content is derived from an [[:Wikipedia:XML database|XML data model]], which can be used freely in accordance with the [[:Wikipedia:Creative Commons license|Creative Commons license]] (with attribution).\n\nAs can be noticed, [[Tolkien Gateway]] uses Eldamo widely as reference for names that are not glossed in the main sources.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n[[Category:Linguistic websites]]\n[[fi:Eldamo]]"}}}
