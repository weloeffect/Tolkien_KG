War was there. \n\nThere run dark waters \nMorthond, under mountains \nDeath in the morning and at day's end \nLords took and lowly... \n\nGrey now \nas tears gleaming \nsilver, red it rolled then \nfoam dyed with blood \n\nGrey now as tears gleaming silver \nRed then it rolled... water \nFoam dyed with blood flamed at a sunset \nAs flowers mountains burned at evening\n</poem>\n{{title}}\n[[Category:Songs by Summoning]]"}}}
