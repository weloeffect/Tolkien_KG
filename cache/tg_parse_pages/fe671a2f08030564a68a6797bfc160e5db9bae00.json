Tolkien]], the first guide written by the people for the people—that is, the people who love Middle-earth—the authors from the #1 Tolkien fan website looked at a variety of big themes surrounding the fictional worlds Tolkien created. What made this book different is that the fans, not the scholars, were defining the issues and offering a fresh and unique perspective not seen before in print. With More People's Guide to JRR Tolkien, the indispensable companion volume that fans have been asking for has arrived. \n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]"}}}
