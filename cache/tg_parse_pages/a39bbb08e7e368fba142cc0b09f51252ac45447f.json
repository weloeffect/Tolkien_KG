It arrived yesterday, and is now at last 'published'. We are <u>all</u> so much looking forward to your coming again this winter. It was not like Christmas without you. I have bought another second-hand car partly with money already brought in by \"The Hobbit\". It is quieter, quicker, and very much steadier and less bumpy, so [?now] I think I shall come and fetch you this time, and bring you safe and unshaken direct from door to door.<br>\nI hope you are better,<br>\nYour loving \nRonald.}}\n\n==History==\nTolkien temporarily lost the letter and ended up sending his [[Jane Neave|aunt Jane]] another copy of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' with another letter dated [[October 6]].
