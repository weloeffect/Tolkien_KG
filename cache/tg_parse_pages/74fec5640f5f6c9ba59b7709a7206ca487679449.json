Frodo has a vision of himself, [[Elrond]] and [[Gandalf]] setting sail. At Bilbo's 129th birthday, he tells Frodo that he will depart from the Grey Havens on the White Ship tomorrow. Gandalf explains that they are old and have completed their job; The [[Third Age]] is over and the Age of [[Men|Man]] has begun. Bilbo asks why Bilbo can join him, believing only Elves can board the ships. Elrond explains he has served them well and there is \"always room for a friend\".
