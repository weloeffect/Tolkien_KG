Normally, \"High King\" would refer to a king who ruled over other lesser kings and lords, but this is not necessarily the case with the High King of the Dúnedain. \n\nIn [[Gil-galad's letter]], [[Tar-Meneldur]] the fifth King of [[Númenor]], was referred to as \"High King\",<ref>{{UT|Wife}}</ref> though he had no other rulers in his service.<ref group=note>Possibly the title refers to the King's overlordship over the colonists of [[Middle-earth]].</ref>\n==Realms in Exile==\nThe more common use of the title, though, came in the later [[Second Age]], with the establishment of the [[Realms in Exile]] in [[Middle-earth]]. In their earliest years, the Two Kingdoms of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]] were formed under the ultimate rule of one man, [[Elendil]], who dwelt in [[Annúminas]] as the High King. The South-kingdom of Gondor was ruled jointly by his sons, but only under his suzerainty.\n\nWith Elendil's death against Sauron in the [[Siege of Barad-dûr]], his elder son [[Isildur]] inherited the High Kingship. Isildur ruled for only two years, though, before he too was lost in the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]] before he could truly take up the rule of his twin realms.<ref>{{UT|Gladden}}</ref> \n===Decline===\nAfter Isildur's death, historical events conspired to separate the Two Kingdoms, each of which took Kings of their own. The High Kingship should in principle have fallen on the [[Heir of Isildur]] [[Valandil (King of Arnor)|Valandil]], but in practice Valandil became King of Arnor only, and had no power over the South-kingdom.\n\nIn the mid-[[Third Age]], Gondor was left kingless; [[Arvedui]], as Isildur's heir, attempted to invoke the [[Law of Succession in Númenor]] to claim the throne of Gondor, thus becoming High King; the [[Council of Gondor]] voted against his claim.<ref name=gondor>{{App|Gondor}}</ref> Shortly after, both realms would lose their kingship.\n\n==Reign of Elessar==\n[[File:Rowena Morrill - The Last Steward of Gondor.jpg|thumb|''The Last Steward of Gondor'' by [[:Category:Images by Rowena Morrill|Rowena Morrill]]]]\nBefore the [[War of the Ring]], there had been no [[Kings of Gondor|King of Gondor]] for 969 years,<ref>{{App|TA}}, T.A. 2050. Eärnur would disappear in Minas Morgul</ref> and no [[Kings of Arnor|King]] of a united [[Arnor]] for 2,158 years.<ref>{{App|TA}}, T.A. 861. Arnor split into three realms, eliminating the kingship of Arnor. Isildur's heirs would remain as Kings of Arthedain.</ref> After [[Sauron]]'s passing [[Aragorn]] the direct descendant and [[Heir of Isildur]], as well as [[Anárion]], through many generations, ascended to the throne of [[Gondor]].\n\nAragorn took the title of '''King of the [[West]]'''<ref name=great/> also '''King of Gondor and Arnor''' and '''Lord of the [[Westlands]]''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] '''''Hîr i Mbair Annui'''''<ref>{{SD|XI}}, [[King's Letter]]</ref>) signifying his Kingship over all the [[Free peoples]] of the [[Westlands]], from the north to the south.<ref name=great>{{App|Great}}</ref> His rule of the West is therefore referred to as the [[Reunited Kingdom]].<ref>{{FR|Records}}</ref>\n\nUnder his crown and protection were other kingdoms, like the [[Kingdom of Dale]] and the [[Kingdom Under the Mountain]].<ref name=great/>\n{{references|note}}\n{{title}}\n[[Category:Dúnedain]]\n[[Category:Rulers of Arnor]]\n[[Category:Rulers of Gondor]]\n[[Category:Mannish titles]]"}}}
