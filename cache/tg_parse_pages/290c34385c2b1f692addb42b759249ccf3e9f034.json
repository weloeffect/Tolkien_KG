Brânk was invented for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'' by [[Amazon Studios]], where he is portrayed by [[Yasen Atour]]. He appeared in the second season of the series.\n\n==History==\nWhile in the service of the [[Dark Wizard]] who dwelt in [[Caras Gaer]], Brânk pursued and attempted to capture [[the Stranger]] as well as the [[Harfoots]] [[Elanor Brandyfoot|Nori Brandyfoot]] and [[Poppy Proudfellow]]. He was unsuccessful after the Stranger magically conjured a sandstorm which caused Brânk and his Gaudrim compatriots to flee.\n[[File:The Rings of Power (TV series) - Brank and Dark Wizard.png|left|thumb|371x371px|Brânk confronts the Dark Wizard.]]\nBrânk and his Gaudrim later come upon the [[Stoors|Stoor]] village and find both Nori and Poppy staying there. He captured the two Harfoots and, while demanding his payment for their capture, he threatened Nori's life while the Dark Wizard was attempting to persuade the Stranger to join him. The Dark Wizard used his magic to push Brânk against rock wall where a jagged branch dug into the back of the Gaudrim's head, appearing to kill him.\n\nHis apparent death showed the Dark Wizard's aptitude for violence and caused the Stranger to refuse to fall in league the Dark Wizard.\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Brânk'' does not appear to have any translations in [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s [[languages]] and is likely an invention of the creators of the series. It may be a name in [[Rhûnnic]].\n\n''Brank'' is an English word defined as \"an instrument consisting of an iron frame surrounding the head and a sharp metal bit or gag entering the mouth formerly used to punish scolds.\"<ref>{{Cite web|articleurl=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/brank#:~:text=a,usually%20used%20in%20plural|articlename=Brank|author=Merriam Webster|accessed=21 October 2024}}</ref>{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Men from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) characters]]"}}}
