Running through the morning dew her gown became bejeweled upon its hem.  As she stood gleaming with her hair upon her shoulders, watching a [[kingfishers|kingfisher]], she heard music – flutes, harps, and the voices of [[Elves]]. Soon an Elven ship appeared with some rowing and three wearing crowns. The oarsmen sang of the green land, and when Fíriel asked them where they were going, answered that they are off to [[Elvenhome]].\n[[File:Pauline Baynes - Fíriel and the Last Ship.jpg|thumb|250px|right|\"Fíriel and the Last Ship\" by [[Pauline Baynes]]]]\nHowever, the oars halted as they spied Fíriel on the shore. Calling the Earth-maiden elven-fair, they offered to take her with them since there was room for one more. Fíriel took one step towards them, but when her foot sank deep into the clay at the water's edge she halted and cried that she could not come, being born a daughter of Earth. Turning away, she walked back to her house, the dew-jewels gone. She put on a russet brown smock, braided her hair, and began that day's chores.\n\nAt the critical moment when Fíriel almost joined the departing Elves, it was the sinking of her foot deep into the clay of the riverbank that recalled to her the fact that she was but a mortal.\n\n==Etymology==\nIn ''[[Morgoth's Ring]]'', it was said that [[Míriel|Míriel Serindë]], the first wife of [[Finwë]], was renamed ''Fíriel'', meaning \"she that died\". Thus the name \"Fíriel\" is associated with the idea of a mortal woman.<ref>{{MR|P3II3f}}</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n\n{{title}}\n{{legend}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]\n[[Category:Men]]"}}}
