Ramer speculated that these true forms, if they had any, were invisible, only becoming visible when entering a work of their own.<ref name=\"Alien_Life_In_Eä\"/>\n\nHe witnessed the En-keladim performing the ''[[Drama of the Silver Tree]]'', one of their [[Keladian]] plays. Ramer watched as they sat in a circle, singing in Keladian. As they sang, the story of the ''Drama of the Silver Tree'' took \"''visible life among them''\".<ref name=\"Alien_Life_In_Eä\"/>\n\nLater, when Ramer recounted his experience in the [[Notion Club]], he likened them as being [[Elvish]] in a way, but not like what most [[Men]] think of [[Elves]], not being lofty or fallen.<ref name=\"Alien_Life_In_Eä\"/>\n\nAfter Ramer's recollection, [[Wilfrid Trewin Jeremy]] asked if he would consider them to be ''[[Incarnate|hnau]]'', and if they perhaps possess their own language. To this, Ramer supposed that the En-keladim possessed many languages, but that he may have forgotten them. To Jeremy's question about whether they were hnau, Ramer answered without hesitation that they were not hnau because the En-keladim were not bound to a single form. Rather, they made, or took, their own, or went around invisible without feeling naked.<ref name=\"Alien_Life_In_Eä\"/>\n\nRamer then theorized that Ellor Eshúrizel was but one of the many worlds throughout [[Eä]] that the En-keladim inhabited, speculating they were devoted to what [[Men]] called matter, especially with its beauty. Ramer then further speculated that perhaps this meant that they possibly had, or still have, an habitation on [[Arda]] with work to do still.<ref name=\"Alien_Life_In_Eä\"/>\n\nIn a footnote written by [[Nicholas Guildford]], the En-keladim were said to be language-makers.<ref name=\"Long Note\">{{SD|2c}}, p. 221</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nIn Note 64, [[Christopher Tolkien]] revealed that the En-keladim were originally named as the '''Mârim''', which was then changed immediately to the '''Albarim'''. In Note 65, Ramer originally likened the En-keladim as being Eldilic as well as being similar to [[J.R.R. Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien's]] [[Vanyar|Unfallen Elves]] or even being some lesser rank of the Eldila from [[C.S. Lewis|C.S. Lewis's]] ''[[The Space Trilogy]]'', yet not being the same.<ref name=\"Long Note\"/>\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Other races]]\n[[Category:The Notion Club Papers]]"}}}
