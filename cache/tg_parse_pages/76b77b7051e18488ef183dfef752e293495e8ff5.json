Though more lived in Staddle there were many [[Bree-hobbits|Hobbits]] in Bree, living on the higher slopes of the hill, above the houses of the Men.<ref>{{FR|Sign}}, p. 173</ref>\n\nOn its southern slopes there were flourishing growths of [[pipe-weed]], which was probably brought to the north along the [[Greenway]] and the [[Bree-hobbits]] claimed they were the first actual smokers of the leaf. Being an ancient cross-road, the \"[[smoking|art]]\" spread from there to other wanderers and races. [[Tobold Hornblower]] probably discovered the leaf there, introducing it to [[the Shire]].<ref>{{FR|Pipeweed}}, pp. 8-9</ref>\n\nThe southern slopes contained the fields called [[Southlinch]], which produced a weed variety of that name.<ref>{{HM|UI}}, entry ''Southlinch'', p. 653</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Bree-hill'' is a [[Wikipedia:List of tautological place names|tautological place name]], because it means \"hill-hill\"<ref name=\"RC\">{{HM|RC}}, p. 16</ref>.\n\nThe element ''Bree'' is a British (i.e. [[Celtic]]) word for \"hill\"<ref>{{App|Translation}}, p. 1135</ref>. [[Wayne Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] suggest that the name ''Bree'' is derived from the [[Welsh]] word ''bre'', which means \"hill\".<ref name=\"RC\" /> [[Tom Shippey]] also points out that ''Bree'' means \"hill\" in Welsh.<ref name=\"Road\">[[Tom Shippey]], [[The Road to Middle-earth]], Chapter 4: A Cartographic Plot, Getting started, third edition, p. 124</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] mentioned to also look at Brill and that it was derived from bree + hill when he mentioned that [[Chetwood]] was a compound of Celtic and English elements that both mean \"wood\".<ref>{{HM|N}}, entry '''Archet''', p. 765</ref>\n\nTom Shippey mentions that J.R.R. Tolkien was inspired by the town of [[Wikipedia:Brill,_Buckinghamshire|Brill, Buckinghamshire]], which is located on a hill ten miles from [[Oxford]], when he chose the names ''Bree'' and ''Bree-hill''.<ref name=\"Road\" /> [[Christopher Tolkien]] confirmed that the name ''Bree'' is based on ''Brill'' in [[wikipedia:Buckinghamshire|Buckinghamshire]], which his father knew well.<ref>{{RS|1VIIN}}, note 6, p. 131</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Arnor]]\n[[Category:Eriador]]\n[[Category:Hills]]\n[[de:Breeberg]]\n[[fi:Briivuori]]\n[[Category:Bree-land]]"}}}
