It gives a glimpse of radical changes [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] conceived regarding the [[legendarium]]. It describes the complete change in the vision of the cosmology of [[Eä]], with the [[Round World version of the Silmarillion]] being a prime example. In addition, the section deals with the problem of the origins of the [[Orcs]]. The texts are, according to [[Christopher Tolkien]], written in mid and late [[1950]]'s.\n==Introduction==\nTolkien had come to have considerable doubts about the \"Flat World\" he had developed earlier, on which the basis of [[The Silmarillion|''The Silmarillion'']], published posthumously, had drawn its source. He considered it \"primitive\" and unfitting that a myth written in the second millennium would have such a foundation. He then began ''The Silmarillion'' with this in mind, but he never finished this version.<ref>{{MR|P5}}, ''Text I''</ref>\n\n==The Significance of the Two Trees==\n[[File:Lady Elleth - Arien.jpg|left|thumb|Arien as depicted by Lady Elleth.]]\nWhen [[Ilúvatar]] created [[Eä]] (the universe), various [[Ainur]] governed different parts of it. He gave [[Varda]] a gift of \"Primeval Light\", which Varda set in the [[Sun]], the heart and the holiest place in [[Arda]] (which here means the entire Solar System), and gave the Sun to [[Arien]] to protect and to guide.\n\nHowever, after the war with the other [[Valar]], [[Melkor]] desired the Light that was placed in the Sun. He offered to make Arien his spouse and to share this gift with him, but she refused. After Arien's refusal, Melkor ravished her, and some say that her spirit left [[Eä]] altogether and the Light that Ilúvatar set in the Sun was no more.\n\nAfter Melkor ravished Arien, he was scorched and black. As he desired light before, he now desired only darkness, and the light hurt him.\n\nThis was not the end of the malice of Melkor, for he came in secret to the North of the [[Ambar]] (Earth). In the defiance of Melkor, who now only came forth at night and in the bitter-most north, and would soon turn the night into his own domain and cover it with fear, the [[Valar]] made the [[Moon]] to brighten the world that was slowly falling to Melkor's darkness.<ref>{{MR|P5}}, ''Text II''</ref>\n\nBefore or after Melkor had ravished Arien, the Valar somehow managed to capture some of that Primeval, \"untainted\", Light into the form of the [[Two Trees]].<ref>{{MR|P5}}, ''Text II''</ref>\n\n==Awakening of Elves and Men==\nThe [[Eldar]] worshiped Varda above all the other Valar. However, Varda did not kindle the stars, and her power was limited to [[Arda]] alone.<ref>{{MR|P5}}, ''Text IV''</ref>\n\nThough the World was always sunlit, Melkor somehow darkened the Earth, cutting off all vision of the sky. [[Manwë]] summoned winds to blow away the occluding clouds that Melkor wrought. Precisely at that moment, when the stars were again visible, the [[Elder Children of Ilúvatar]] awoke. Thus, they were known as the \"People of the Stars.\"\n\nThe [[Awakening of Men]] occurred somewhere between {{YT|1050}} and {{YT|1100}} (considering the fact that Melkor managed to corrupt the hearts of [[Men]] before he was besieged in [[Utumno]]).<ref>{{MR|P5}}, ''Text II''</ref>\n\n==Valian Years==\n[[File:David Greset - Cuivienen - the awakening of the Elves.jpg|thumb|352x352px|''The Awakening of the Elves'' by David Greset.]]\nOne [[Valian Years|Valian Year]] was equal to 144 solar years, and the Ainur and the Elves had similar life \"cycles\". In other words, their passage of time was different from that of Men. That was also one of the reasons why the Elvish long year (''[[yén]]'') was equivalent to the Valian Year, as Ilúvatar arranged this symbiosis between the two \"immortal\" kindred.<ref>{{MR|P5}}, ''Text XI''</ref>\n\nProblems arose when calculating years. For example, the [[Flight of the Noldor]], which took about five Valian Years, would equate to approximately 700 years according to the long count, from the murder of [[Finwë]] to the coming of [[Fingolfin]] to [[Beleriand]]. Time passed \"slowly\" in [[Aman]], so that the passage of one Valian Year to an Elf in Aman would seem like one solar year for a mortal. This is also factored into the reasoning of the [[Ban of the Valar]], which sought to discourage the [[Númenóreans]] from the temptation of sailing to the \"Immortal\" Lands.\n\n==The Chaining of Melkor==\n[[File:Jacek Kopalski - The Captivity of Morgoth.jpg|left|thumb|''The Captivity of Morgoth'' by Jacek Kopalski.]]\nThe [[Battle of the Powers]] was a desperate attempt to divert the forces of Melkor from the [[Great Journey|March of the Eldar]]. In the beginning, Melkor was second only to Ilúvatar in might and potency, and was of such power that even all of the Valar combined could not hope to match him. The Valar expected (along with the lesser spirits that he corrupted) an almost unbeatable foe, and at best a delaying action for the sake of the [[Quendi]].<ref>{{MR|P5VI}}, p. 339</ref>\n\nBy attacking Melkor's armies piecemeal and dividing his servants, the Valar believed that they could reach Melkor directly and combat him together. When the host of the Valar and the [[Maiar]] marched to Utumno, they were surprised to see Melkor was no longer impervious to personal contact and, separated from his agents, the Valar found they could now match his power together. Manwë himself could barely recognize his brother, as Melkor had fallen so low due to having scatterd of most of his essence into the matter of Arda, the formation of his creatures, and the corruption of other spirits. Due to this scattering of his essence, Melkor became bound to the very world he was trying to conquer, and was susceptible to physical hurt and imprisonment. Melkor, too, was shocked, seeing himself as now personally weaker than his brother and no longer able to daunt him with but a gaze.<ref>{{MR|P5VI}}, p. 340</ref>\n\nMelkor did not fight Tulkas, nor Manwë, nor the other Valar, and willingly surrendered. For a very brief moment, Melkor considered repenting from his ways, but his hatred of the Valar was greater, and he devised to bring ruin to them in secret. And so it happened that Melkor fell to his knees and feigned repentance and a desire to go to [[Valinor]] along with the host that had attacked him.  Melkor thought that he could find vengeance against those that had humiliated him by claiming to serve them in penance while corrupting Valinor from within, and made a cruel mockery of their mercy.<ref>{{MR|P5VI}}, p. 341</ref>\n\nThough he was taken to Valinor and was not chained (although [[Tulkas]] clinked the [[Angainor]] behind his back all the way to [[Aman]]), he was still judged and imprisoned in the [[Halls of Mandos]] for three ages, which was not in accordance with his plan.<ref>{{MR|P5}}, ''Text VI''</ref> Ages later, at the end of the [[War of Wrath]] in {{FA|590}}, he was beheaded and thrust into the [[Void]], and his impotent spirit fled outside the [[Time]] and Space.<ref>{{MR|P5}}, ''Text VII''</ref>\n\n==Of the Origin of the Orcs==\n[[File:Turner Mohan - Early Orcs.jpg|thumb|338x338px|''Early Orcs'' by Turner Mohan.]]\nThe evolution of the origin of the [[Orcs]] is complicated and Tolkien, apparently, did not settle his mind on their nature.\n\nIn ''The Silmarillion'' and one of the writings in the text it is said that they were bred from the captured Elves, and by slow arts of cruelty became what they are now.<ref>{{MR|P5}}, ''Text VII'', ''Text IX''</ref>\n\nIn some later writings, the Orcs are said to be mere puppets of their Lords, namely [[Morgoth]] and [[Sauron]], with the addition of some Orc-shaped Maiar ([[Boldog]] being an example of such a being).<ref>{{MR|P5}}, ''Text VIII''; ''\"Orcs\"''</ref>\n\nNonetheless, in his final writings, Tolkien speculated that the Orcs surely must come from [[Men]], seeing as their [[fëa|''fëar'']] are weaker and less in control of their bodies than those of the Elves.<ref>{{MR|P5}}, ''Text X''</ref>\n\nIn addition, Tolkien also pondered that the Orcs are a mixture of both the Elves and the Men, and that some Men after the \"creation\" of the Orcs were interbred with them.<ref>{{MR|P5}}, ''Text IX''</ref> This also seems to be a very late text, considering he used the spelling \"Orks\" instead, which he adopted in about [[1969]].\n\n==Contents==\n*Introduction\n*Text I\n*Text II (including an abandoned narrative on the creation of the World and the war with Melkor)\n*Text III\n*Text IV\n*Text V\n*Text VI (including an essay titled \"Melkor Morgoth\")\n*Text VII (including three essays)\n*Text VIII (including an essay titled \"Orcs\")\n*Text IX\n*Text X (including another essay titled \"Orcs\"\n*Text XI (including two essays titled \"Aman\" and \"Aman and Mortal Men\")\n\n==Notes==\nThere are allusions to the world being round from the beginning in the [[Sauron Defeated|Volume IX]] of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''.<ref>{{SD|Drowning}}</ref>\n\nWhile certain essays, such as ''Melkor Morgoth'', were given dates of the early to mid 1950s, Christopher speculated these essays were likely finalized at the end of the decade.<ref>{{MR|P5VI}}, pp. 342</ref>\n\n{{references}}"}}}
