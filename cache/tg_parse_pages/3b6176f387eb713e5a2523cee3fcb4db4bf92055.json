Krieg]] and others.\n\nDiscussing the earliest stages of [[Elvish]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', [[Christopher Tolkien]] suggested this book as a reference for the vocabulary of [[Quenya]] of the later stages.<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}</ref>\n==Structure==\n===Eldarin tongues===\nThe first articles offer analyses of the [[Elvish]] texts published. Extrapolation of a sketchy grammar is offered based on the available data, as well as meaning of the names found in the books. \n\nThere is also a chapter that goes on to discuss the relationship of [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]] and analyze a possible \"[[Common Eldarin|Proto-Eldarin]]\" through comparative linguistics. \n\nThese chapters are followed by glossaries pointing at possible real-word similarities.\n\nAn article written from Tolkien's [[secondary world]] perspective, explains how [[Elvish]] possibly influenced the Indo-European languages.\n\n===Other tongues===\nMore obscure languages like [[Khuzdul]], [[Black Speech]], \"[[Adûnaic]] tongues\" and more obscure ones ([[Westron]], [[Mannish]], [[Entish]], \"[[Valinorean]]\") are also briefly discussed. Their sources are primarily information as given in the [[The Lord of the Rings Appendices|Appendices]].\n\n===Personal names===\nA part of the book is dedicated to [[tolkiennymy]] and provides etymologies of the [[Old English]], [[Gothic]] and [[Norse]] names and other words which represent [[Mannish]] languages ([[Westron]] and [[Rohanese]]); possible influences from British and Celtic folklore are pointed out. \n\nThere is also a \"Baby-book\" with all the known [[Germanic]], [[Celtic]] and other real-world (\"translated\") Hobbit names by category and gender, along with their etymologies.\n\n===Writing systems===\nAn extensive section with analyses of the [[Tengwar]] and [[Cirth]] in  which aims to be more clear and readable presentation of the information of [[Appendix E]], followed by theoretical and structural background, with a possible history of their evolution through time.\n\nExamples of English-tengwar texts used by [[Tolkien fandom|fans]] are given, with analyses and commentaries. \n\nAlso, a chapter compares [[Wikipedia:Francis Lodwick|Francis Lodwick]]'s \"Universal Alphabet\" with Tengwar.\n\n==Sources and validity==\nThe book was compiled shortly before ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' was published therefore its material was only the works published during Tolkien's lifetime: ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'', ''[[The_Road_Goes_Ever_On_(book)|The Road Goes Ever On]]'' and ''[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings]]''\n\nThe book was complete in [[1977]] but publication was halted for a year. ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' was published in the meantime which included new material that (in few points) obsoleted the theories of the book. A year later, and while the book was still in a hiatus, Jim Allan wrote about those points in the postscript of his Foreword; he points out that updating the text by incorporating the new information  would not be possible, and encourages critical comparison by the reader.<ref name=post/>\n\nSince 1977, a great amount of material was published in the ''[[The History of Middle-earth|History of Middle-earth]]'' series, not to mention magazines such as ''[[Vinyar Tengwar]]'' and ''[[Parma Eldalamberon]]''. While fans still appear to consent that the book is one of the best and more serious works, new material have rendered the theories incomplete or outdated. However, some of the parts of the book, like the one concerning real-world names and the writing systems, are still considered to provide useful information.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.amazon.com/review/product/0905220102/ref=cm_cr_dp_synop?_encoding=UTF8&showViewpoints=0&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending#R2TPR6UGA05XID|articlename=Customer Reviews of ''An Introduction to Elvish''|dated=|website=AM|accessed=6 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Proto-Eldarin===\nIn their articles, [[Christopher Gilson]] and [[Bill Welden]] attempt to shed light to the common ancestor of Quenya and Sindarin, dubbed \"Proto-Eldarin\" and investigate the sound changes from the [[First Age]] to the end of the [[Third Age]].  The authors claim to have seen some unpublished writings by Tolkien, which may explain how the Proto-Eldarin reconstructions correctly end in long vowels. Of course, with limited material (''[[The Etymologies]]'' and similar works where Tolkien discusses [[Primitive Quendian]] and [[Sundocarme|roots]] were not published until 10 years later) there were some implausible reconstructions. For example, the words ''[[vilya]]'' and ''[[gwaew|gwai]]'' are treated as cognates, derived from Proto-Eldarin **''wigyā''. \n\nThe theories also described the evolution of Sindarin through words of palatal-final consonants (''-ᶅ, -ɲ, -ᶉ'') which sometimes caused [[I-affection|umlaut]]. For example *''winjā'' > **''weiɲ'' (written ''wein<sup>y</sup>'') > ''[[gwain|-wain]]''. ''The Etymologies'' and other works have revealed the evolution of Sindarin through [[Common Telerin]] and [[Old Noldorin]] where no palatalisation occurs; a word such as *''winjā'' would evolve to *''winia'' and umlauts are the result of a much later [[i-affection]].\n\nThe authors generally assume that Proto-Eldarin lost its final sounds before the Quenya stage. For example, Quenya ''[[alda]]'' has been wrongly attributed to a Proto-Eldarin word **''galdar'', with loss of ''-r''; the plural form **''galdari'' produced Quenya plural ''aldar''. In the [[Common Telerin|Sindarin branch]], the form **''gald'' produced Sindarin ''[[galadh]]'' through [[epenthesis]] (called ''svarabhakti'' in the book).<ref>{{HM|IE}}, Proto-Eldarin</ref>\n\nThe analysis also correctly supposed the existence of initial nasal stops, such as ''mb-'' which evolved to Quenya ''m-'' and Sindarin ''b-''. Ironically, the foreword of the book mentions that the theory was deemed as incompatible to new Elvish data found in the recent ''Silmarillion'', and suggested that the evidence for the nasal stops was only a result of coincidence.<ref name=post>{{HM|IE}}, Foreword (Postscript), p. xvij</ref> However, later sources such as ''The Etymologies'' confirmed that initial nasal stops indeed existed in the Primitive Quendian stage (cf. words like ''ndōro'', ''mbandō'', ''ñgōlē'').<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}</ref><ref>{{webcite|website=Arda|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articlename=Primitive Elvish|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/primelv.htm}}</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n{{title|italics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Introduction to Elvish, An}}\n[[Category:Linguistic books]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
