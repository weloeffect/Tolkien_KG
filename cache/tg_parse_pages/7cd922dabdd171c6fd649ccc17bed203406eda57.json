The kingdoms of Dorthonion were destroyed at that point, including [[Ladros]] and the realm of [[Angrod]] and [[Aegnor]]. [[Barahir]] remained as an outlaw in Taur-nu-Fuin, and after his death [[Beren]] his son dwelt in this forest for several years, before crossing the [[Ered Gorgoroth]] and forsaking Dorthonion to its captors.

In those woods the pursuing [[Beleg]] came upon [[Gwindor]], who told him of seeing Túrin being whipped and driven towards [[Angband]].
