It lay in the southern part of Isengard's defences, approached by an ancient highway. At least in [[Saruman]]'s time as master of Isengard, the gate was heavily guarded, though it was eventually thrown down by the invading [[Ents]].\n\nAccording to some background material, Saruman had given his Gate special properties. Whether by some mechanism or spell, he was able to project his famous voice through the Gate itself, and so communicate with those outside his defences without putting himself at risk.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Gate of Isengard is protected by two great Trolls that can kill a player of their level in two hits and require a dozen or more to take them down.\n\n[[Category:Doors and gates]]\n[[Category:Rohan]]"}}}
