Tolkien]]. \n\nFarrer and her husband [[Wikipedia:Austin Farrer|Austin Farrer]] were neighbours with the Tolkiens from [[1947]] to [[1950]] when they lived at [[3 Manor Road]].<ref>{{CG|II}}</ref> In [[1948]], Tolkien sent her [[letter 115|a letter]] which included manuscripts with both the flat and [[Round World version of the Silmarillion]]. She responded back saying \"I like the Flat Earth versions best. The hope of Heaven is the only thing which makes modern astronomy tolerable: otherwise there must be an East and a West and Walls: aims and choices and not an endless circle of wandering.\" Christopher Tolkien believed that this was influential in his father's choice to abandon the round world concept.<ref>{{MR|Ainu}}, p. 6</ref> Several letters written to her by Tolkien were published in ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]''.<ref group=note>Her name was erroneously spelt 'Katherine', which was corrected in the revised and expanded edition.</ref>\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Letters to Katharine Farrer|Letters to Katharine Farrer]]\n{{References|notes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cox, Brian}}\n[[Category:British people]]\n[[Category:Letter receivers]]\n[[Category:People by name]]\n\n[[de:Katharine Farrer]]"}}}
