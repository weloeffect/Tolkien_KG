Tolkien]] attempted to write a '''Lay of Eärendel''', resulting in a mere fragment included in the chapter \"[[Poems Early Abandoned]]\" in ''[[The Lays of Beleriand]]''. It was written and left unfinished during his time at the [[University of Leeds]], probably in [[1925]]. It has no title and does not extend far enough to make clear what could be its subject, but at the end of the text Tolkien wrote in different scripts 'Earendel', 'Earendel son of Fengel', 'Earendel Fengelsson'; so [[Christopher Tolkien]] states that this poem was the beginning of a ''Lay of Eärendel''.<ref name=LB>{{LB|2b}}, pp. 141-3</ref>\n\n==Analysis==\nAlong with ''[[The Flight of the Noldoli from Valinor|The Flight of the Noldoli]]'' and ''[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]'', this was other piece of alliterative verse concerned with the matter of the ''[[Lost Tales]]'', but this is in the first stage of composition and is exceedingly rough. It narrates quickly the [[Fall of Gondolin]], the escape of the fugitives down the [[Idril's secret way|secret tunnel]] and the flight at [[Cristhorn]], ending with the long wandering in the wilds thereafter. These deeds would serve as the introduction to the Lay. The only differences respect to \"[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]\" are: Cristhorn is not in the south of [[Gondolin]], but in the north, and the exiles sought for the [[Sirion]] during thirty moons.<ref name=LB/>\n==Poem excerpt==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">Lo! the flame of fire and fierce hatred\nengulfed Gondolin and its glory fell,\nits tapering towers and its tall rooftops\nwere laid all low, and its leaping fountains\nmade no music more on the mount of Gwareth,\nand its whitehewn walls were whispering ash.</poem>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Eärendillinwë]]\n* [[Index:Poems by J.R.R.
