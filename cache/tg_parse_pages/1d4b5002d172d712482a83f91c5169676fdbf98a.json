They spread from [[Utumno]] to the [[Iron Mountains]] and from [[Misty Mountains]] to the [[Orocarni]]. Morgoth's servants used them as hidden passages to avoid the [[Valar]]. The core of the Under-deeps survived the [[War of Wrath]], and so do some of Morgoth's servants and creatures, though many of the passages are blocked or hidden.<ref name=\"main\"/>\n\n* The '''Iron Road''', leading from East to West, connected Uax, Utumno, and [[Thangorodrim]]\n* The '''Oldest Road''', leading from North to South, connected [[Carn Dûm]], [[Gundabad]], Moria, and the [[Glittering Caves]]\n* The '''Red Road''', leading from North to South, connected Uax and Sammath Helcar\n* The '''Black Road''', leading from East to West, connected Moria, [[Dol Guldur]] and [[Barad-dûr]]\n* The '''White Road''', leading from East to West, connected the Glittering Caves and [[Dunharrow]]\n* The '''Grey Road''', leading from East to West, connected Gundabad and Sammath Maeglom\n* The '''Gold Road''', leading from North to South, connected Ôlbamarl and Laurafelya\n* The '''Yellow Road''', leading from East to West, connected Sammath Fhûl and Sambi Mornya\n\nOf these, the Oldest Road (named so despite being younger than the Iron Road) was the most intact. Moria lay on a junction of this road with the Black Road, and Dwarves believe [[Mahal]] chose this on purpose to contest Morgoth's dominance.<ref name=\"main\"/>\n\nWhen the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm transformed Hwáin's Well into a mineshaft, hoping to find [[mithril]], they inadvertently broke into the Under-deeps. This allowed the [[Durin's Bane]] to enter Khazad-dûm. Soon after the Dwarves managed to construct a Stone of Sealing to seal off the Under-deeps for good, but it was captured by the Balrog before it could be used. The recovery of this Stone is what finally allowed the Dwarves to retake Khazad-dûm in the [[Fourth Age]].<ref>{{ICE|2011}}, pp. 143-146</ref>\n\n==History in The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game==\nWhile further excavated by the Dwarves in search of mithril, most of the tunnels and caverns long predated the Dwarves. They also housed many strange creatures awakened by the rise of the Balrog. Old Dwarven outposts meant to defend Khazad-dûm against attacks from the Underdeeps were taken over by Orcs.<ref name=\"decipher\"/>\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Locations from adaptations]]"}}}
