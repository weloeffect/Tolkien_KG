In the event, the Noldor left behind chose instead to march across the deadly [[Helcaraxë]].<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref> \n\nAccording to a legend, another reason to burn the ships at Losgar was to prevent some Noldor from turning back, such as his own son [[Amrod]], who was uncomfortable with his father's deeds. According to this legend, Amrod died as he was still sleeping inside the first ship burned.<ref>{{PM|XI7}}, pp. 354-355</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Losgar'' is [[Sindarin]], but it is never glossed. However, the name appears in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', meaning \"Place of Flowers\" in [[Gnomish]], but it is a rejected name for [[Alalminórë]], a region of [[Tol Eressëa]].<ref>{{LT1|I}}. pp. 16, 21</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Beleriand]]\n[[Category:Regions]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[de:Losgar]]\n[[fi:Losgar]]"}}}
