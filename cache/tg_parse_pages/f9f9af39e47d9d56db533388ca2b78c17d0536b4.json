However it was already too late; the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]] managed to overthrow [[Arthedain]], the last remnant of the Northern Kingdom of [[Arnor]]. \nAngmar was in turn destroyed by [[Host of the West (Arnor)|the forces of Gondor]] and the [[Elves]].<ref name=gondor>{{App|Gondor}}</ref><ref name=ta>{{App|TA}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Nazgûl]] gathered back in [[Mordor]] to prepare for Sauron's return;<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref> they subsequently [[Second Fall of Minas Ithil|captured]] [[Minas Ithil]] in {{TA|2002}}, and [[Gondor]] suffered the end of the line of the [[Kings of Gondor]] with the loss of [[Eärnur]] in {{TA|2050}}. The [[Dwarves of Khazad-dûm]] also suffered a major loss with the awakening of a [[Balrog]] and the subsequent evacuation of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], which caused many [[Galadhrim]] to seek to leave [[Middle-earth]].<ref name=gondor/><ref name=ta/> By {{TA|2060}} the shadow of Dol Guldur grew so much that [[the Wise]] realised that Sauron was returning there.<ref name=ta/>\n\n[[File:John Howe - Pass the Doors of Dol Guldur.jpg|thumb|[[John Howe]] - ''Pass the Doors of Dol Guldur'']]\nBut Sauron's plans were to change; in {{TA|2063}} [[Gandalf]] went there to investigate; the \"Necromancer\" fled to the [[East]].<ref name=ta/>\n\nDuring his absence, the Nazgûl remained quiet in [[Minas Morgul]].<ref name=ta/> The Shadow on [[Mirkwood]] had lessened, but the [[Nazgûl]] had used this period to prepare for Sauron's return, who, in the meantime, was corrupting the [[Men]] of the East.\n\n==History==\n===Gondor===\nThe first ten [[Ruling Steward]]s had relative calm in which to renew their strength. These included [[Mardil|Mardil Voronwë]], [[Eradan]], [[Herion]], [[Belegorn]], [[Húrin I]], [[Túrin I]], [[Hador (Steward of Gondor)|Hador]], [[Barahir (Steward of Gondor)|Barahir]], [[Dior (Steward of Gondor)|Dior]], and [[Denethor I]].\n\nDuring the Peace Gondor strengthened its borders, keeping a watchful eye on the east, as [[Minas Morgul]] was still a threat on their flank and [[Mordor]] was still occupied with [[Orcs]]. But no major escalations occurred except for minor skirmishes with the [[Umbar|Haven of Umbar]].\n\nDuring the Peace the garrisons of the forts of [[Calenardhon]] (which was depopulated during the [[Great Plague]]) were not renewed, and local chieftains (whose subjects were increasingly of mixed blood) gained more control.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref>\n\n===Eriador===\nAfter the fall of Angmar the [[Trolls]] of NE Eriador had fled to the east of the [[Misty Mountains]] and didn't trouble the area for some centuries.<ref name=NM>{{NM|P3xvii}}</ref>\n\nThe first seven [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain]] ruled their people, the [[Rangers of the North]], during the Watchful Peace: [[Aranarth]], [[Arahael]], [[Aranuir]], [[Aravir]], [[Aragorn I]], [[Araglas]], and [[Arahad I]]. Even before the Peace ended, evil things such as [[wolves]] and [[Orcs]] secretly invaded or attacked Eriador.<ref name=eriador>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Hobbits]] of [[the Shire]] prospered and even expanded and appointed a [[Thain]] to take the role of the King, the first being [[Bucca]],<ref name=eriador/> and [[Isumbras Took I|Isumbras I]] became the first [[Took]]ish Thain later; [[Buckland]] was first occupied by [[Oldbucks]] at this time.\n\n===Longbeards===\nAt the beginning of the Watchful Peace, the [[Dwarves]] of [[Durin's Folk]] dwelt in both the [[Grey Mountains]] and in [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. [[Thráin I]] made his abode at Erebor, but the majority of his people inhabited the Grey Mountains and his son [[Thorin I]] moved there as well. \n\nHe was followed as [[Kings of Durin's Folk|King of Durin's Folk]] by [[Glóin (King of Durin's Folk)|Glóin]] and [[Óin (King of Durin's Folk)|Óin]].\n\n===North===\nThe [[Éothéod]] dwelt in the north vales of [[Anduin]] during the Watchful Peace.\n\nFurther south, some [[Stoors]] inhabited the areas near the [[Gladden Fields]], having settled there some centuries ago to flee the shadow of [[Angmar]], and formed a matriarchal society.<ref name=eriador/><ref name=shadow>{{FR|Shadow}}</ref> [[Sméagol]] was born and spent his youth there toward the end of the Watchful Peace.<ref name=ta/><ref name=shadow/> \n\n==End of the Peace==\nA new race of Orcs was bred in Mordor, the [[Uruk-hai]].<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref> But Sauron was not idle in the east either: he created a strong alliance between the various tribes of [[Easterlings]], so that when he returned he was more powerful and had many [[Men]] in his service.{{fact}} \n\nIn {{TA|2460}}, Sauron returned with new strength. His return coincided with [[the One Ring]]'s discovery and Sméagol claiming it three years later. In c. {{TA|2480}} Orcs began to spread again in the Misty Mountains in order to block all passes into Eriador, whilst Sauron's creatures took Moria as their own.
