Tolkien's use of Welsh in his Legendarium, ranging from the obvious ('[[Roverandom|Gwynfa]]'—the Welsh word for Paradise), to the apparent ('[[Took Family|Took]]'—a Welsh surname), to the veiled (''[[Gerontius]]''—the Latinizaton of a royal Welsh name), to the hidden ('[[Goldberry]]'—the English [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/calque calque] of a Welsh [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/theonym theonym]).Though it is a book by a linguist, it was written for the non-linguist with the goal of making the topic accessible. The unavoidable jargon is explained in a glossary, and the narrative presents an overview of how Welsh influenced Tolkien's story line, as well as his synthetic languages [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]].The study is based on specific examples of attested names, placed in the context of their linguistic and cultural background, while highlighting the peculiar features of Welsh, \"the senior language of the men of Britain\" ([[The Monsters and the Critics|MC]] p. 189), that Tolkien found so intriguing. It supplements, rather than competes with [[Carl Phelpstead]]'s excellent ''[[Tolkien and Wales]]'', which sidestepped the topic of the Celtic linguistics behind Tolkien's work. Learn the story behind ''[[Lithe]]'', ''[[Buckland]]'', ''[[Anduin]]'', and ''[[Baranduin]]''.}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/press/1044_Tolkien_and_Welsh_Mark_Hooker.php ''Tolkien and Welsh''] at the [[Tolkien Library]]\n*[http://llyfrawr.com/TolkienAndWelsh/TableOfContents.html ''Table of Contents''] at the publisher's website\n\n{{References}}\n\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Linguistic books]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
