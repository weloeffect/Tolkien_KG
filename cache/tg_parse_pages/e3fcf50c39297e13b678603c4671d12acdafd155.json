Deer were loved by the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Nessa]], and were said to follow her as she travelled through wild lands.<ref>{{S|IIb}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[First Age]] the [[Teiglin]] River flowed through a gorge west of the forest of [[Brethil]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref> At the narrowest part of the gorge was ''[[Cabed-en-Aras]]'', \"The Deer's Leap\", where once a deer leaped across the river to escape a huntsman of [[Haleth]].<ref>{{CH|16}}, p. 230</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|2941}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> [[Thorin and Company]] were in the process of crossing the [[Enchanted River]] when a dark-coloured deer bowled into the Dwarves. Although [[Thorin]] shot the hart with an arrow as it leaped there was no recovering the venison for the boat they were using floated away. Worse, the commotion caused [[Bombur]] to fall into the water, which caused him to fall asleep for days after he was rescued. Soon after, a [[white deer]] and her snowy fawns appeared on the path. The dwarves shot arrows at them but none hit and the deer vanished.<ref>{{H|Flies}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nIn [[Sindarin]], the adjective ''[[ross]]'' was often used to describe the copper colour of red deer.<ref>{{VT|41a}}, p. 10</ref>\n\nThe Sindarin term ''[[rhovan]]'' (\"wild\")<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, p. 78, entry \"Rhovanion\"</ref> referred to large beasts, especially the great red deer who lived in the Vales of Anduin and western Mirkwood.<ref name=Rhoven>{{PE|23b}}, p. 136</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''\n:In the Extended Edition of the film, while the hobbits camp at the edge of the [[Midgewater Marshes]], Aragorn leaves them for a while and returns at night, carrying a small deer he had hunted and caught. The dead deer used for filming the scene was bought from a New Zealand farm raising fallow deer as livestock for meat.\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Deer are found in many places of Middle-earth. They are typically not aggressive, but some will fight if the player threatens them. Weaker deer will run away when attacked.\n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Images of deer|Images of deer]]\n*''[[Rhovan]]''\n*[[White deer]]\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Animals]]"}}}
