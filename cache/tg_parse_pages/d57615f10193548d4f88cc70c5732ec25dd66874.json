He had two older sisters, [[Ivriniel]] and [[Finduilas (wife of Denethor)|Finduilas]]. After his father's death, he became Prince in {{TA|3010}}. Imrahil had four children:  [[Elphir]], [[Erchirion]], [[Amrothos]] and [[Lothíriel]].<ref name=\"Elendil\">{{PM|Elendil}}, ''The Line of Dol Amroth'', p. 221</ref>\n\n===War of the Ring===\n[[Image:John Howe - Prince Imrahil.jpg|120px|left|thumb|''Prince Imrahil'' by [[John Howe]]]]\nDuring the [[War of the Ring]], Imrahil came to the aid of his brother-in-law, [[Denethor|Denethor II]]. On [[9 March]], {{TA|3019}}, he came into [[Minas Tirith]] with a company of knights and seven hundred soldiers.<ref name=\"MT\">{{RK|MT}}, p. 771</ref>\nOn [[13 March]], as [[Southrons]] harassed [[Faramir]], Imrahil and his knights, with [[Gandalf]], formed a sortie, and Imrahil himself saved his sister-son from his pursuers.<ref>{{RK|Siege}}, pp. 820-21</ref> Faramir received a poisonous wound, and Denethor fell to madness. Being the highest ranking officer in [[Gondor]] fit for battle, Imrahil took command, and quickly passed it on to Gandalf. \n\nTwo days later, the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] raged before the city. Imrahil ventured outside the city, and witnessed the funeral procession of [[Théoden]]. Here he beheld [[Éowyn]], and wondered that Rohan would send even women in Gondor's great need. Though Théoden had passed, Imrahil recognised that Éowyn still lived (though she was near death), and ordered that she be taken to the [[Houses of Healing]]. \n\nBecause [[Éomer]] and his riders were outnumbered, Imrahil rode into battle, together with [[Húrin (Warden of the Keys)|Húrin the Tall]], [[Forlong|Forlong of Lossarnach]] and [[Hirluin|Hirluin the Fair]], and they were soon joined by [[Aragorn]] who landed at [[Harlond in Gondor|Harlond]]. Imrahil continued East, driving the frightened [[Variags]] and [[orcs]] away. \n\nImrahil survived the battle unscathed, and together with Éomer and Aragorn he came to the [[Great Gate of Minas Tirith]].<ref name=\"Battle\">{{RK|Battle}}, p. 849</ref> Imrahil recognized that Aragorn was the rightful King, but he agreed that it was wise for Aragorn to wait to enter the city, because he knew Denethor was strong-willed and proud. \n\nWhen Imrahil learned that Denethor was dead and Faramir dying, he suggested that Aragorn be summoned, remembering that the Kings of old were great healers. Aragorn came at Gandalf's request to heal the wounded Faramir, Éowyn, and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], but he declared that Prince Imrahil should rule the City until Faramir awoke, in effect granting Imrahil the temporary position of Steward. Though Aragorn also declared that Gandalf should lead them in all things for the remaining days of the war, to which Imrahil agreed.\n\nOn [[16 March]], {{TA|3019}}, [[Legolas]] recognized that Imrahil had elven-blood when he looked at him during their meeting in Minas Tirith.<ref>{{RK|Debate}}, p. 872</ref> On the same day Imrahil participated in the [[Last Debate|debate]] of the [[Captains of the West]]. Gandalf proposed that they march to the [[Morannon]] to distract Sauron's attention from [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] the Ring-bearer. Aragorn agreed to this advice and said that he did not yet claim to command any man, so the others should choose if they wanted to follow it. Imrahil said that he considered Aragorn to be his liege-lord, regardless whether Aragorn claimed it or not and that he would follow him. Imrahil also stated that he stood in the place of the [[Steward of Gondor]] and advised that some troops should remain to protect the City. In the end it was decided that an army of 7,000 would ride forth. Imrahil laughed at the thought.<ref>{{RK|Debate}}, pp. 878-82</ref> [[Húrin the Tall]] was left behind in command.\n\nThe [[Host of the West]] left Minas Tirith on [[18 March]]. Bypassing [[Minas Morgul]] and marching North, the heralds announced the coming of King Elessar at Imrahil's advice. When Sauron's forces emerged from the Black Gate on March 25, Imrahil stood on the front line with his men. They fought the [[Battle of the Morannon]] until [[the One Ring]] was destroyed.<ref>{{RK|Gate}}, p. 891</ref>\n\nPrince Imrahil was present at the celebrations of the [[field of Cormallen]], and the coronation of Aragorn as King Elessar, and rode with the funeral procession of King Théoden to Rohan, remaining in [[Edoras]] after the King's burial on [[August 10]]. Imrahil and Éomer became great friends, and in {{TA|3021}} Éomer wed Imrahil's daughter [[Lothíriel]].<ref>{{App|Mark}}, ''Third Line'', entry 2991-F.A. 63 ''Éomer Éadig'', p. 1070</ref>\n\n===Later life===\nAfter the War of the Ring, Prince Imrahil and his nephew [[Faramir]], [[Prince of Ithilien]], were King Elessar's chief commanders. Imrahil was also part of the Great [[Council of Gondor]], and remained an advisor of the King.<ref>{{L|244}}</ref>\n\nPrince Imrahil died in the year {{FoA|34|n}} of the [[Fourth Age]], and was succeed by his eldest son [[Elphir]], who continued the line of Princes.<ref name=\"Elendil\" />\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Imrahil.mp3|Ardamir}}\n''Imrahil'' is an [[Adûnaic]] name.<ref>{{App|Consonants}}, entry CH, p. 1113</ref><ref>{{PM|Languages}}, manuscript F2, §9 footnote concerning names in Quenya</ref> Its meaning is not glossed.\n\nThe second element ''-hil'', also seen in the name ''[[Adrahil]]'', is perhaps related to the [[Westron]] ending ''-kil''<ref group=\"note\">This ending is found in words like ''[[banakil]], [[Tarkil]]'' and possibly means \"man\"</ref> and perhaps ultimately related to [[Elvish]] \"follower\" ([[KHILI#Other versions|KHIL]]).<ref>{{PE|17}}, entry '''tark''', p. 101</ref><ref name=\"LR\">{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry '''KHIL-''', p. 405</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=[[Andreas Möhn]]|articleurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130308120545/http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Fr_Atani.html|articlename=Etymologies of Atani languages|website=Lalaith's Science Pages}}</ref>\n\nConsidering the Elvish root KHIL, [[Carl F.
