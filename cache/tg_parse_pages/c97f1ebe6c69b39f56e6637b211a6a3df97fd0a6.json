Afterwards, the [[Search of the Ents]] became the subject of many [[Elvish]] songs; some of which were translated into the many [[Mannish|languages]] of [[Men]]. One such song, which the Ents remembered orally, \"used to be sung up and down the [[Anduin|Great River]]\" according to [[Treebeard]]. This song took the form of a dialogue between an Ent and an Entwife and mentioned a prophecy foretelling that they will find a land where they both can be happy together after both have lost everything.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nOn Tuesday<ref>''[[The Chronology of The Lord of the Rings]]'', \"[Others of Company]\", p. 56</ref> of [[29 February]] in the year {{TA|3019}} during the late [[Third Age]],<ref>{{App|B3}}, entry for 29 February</ref> [[Treebeard]] recited the song to [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and [[Peregrin Took]] in [[Fangorn Forest]] after they asked what had happened to them.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n==Background==\nIn late [[1941]] or early [[1942]],<ref name=\"collectedpoems\">{{CP|165}}</ref> [[J.R.R.

Douglas Carter, Tolkien remarked in a letter on [[6 June]] in [[1972]] that the song might be evidence \"that there would be no re-union in 'history'\" between the Ents and the Entwives.<ref>{{L|338}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2008]] essay, \"The Myth of the Ent and the Entwife\", [[Corey Olsen]] speculated that the song was composed by an Elf who did not hold any bias towards either side, managing to convey multiple meanings \"through the layering of the two voices\".<ref>{{TS|5}}, pp. 39-53</ref>\n\nWhile Tolkien never wrote a composition to accompany the song, several fans have made renditions. One version is the work of Bart Zeal entitled \"[http://youtu.be/4pxfoJs0aPQ The Epic of The Ent & The Entwife]\" while another version is sung by Clamavi De Profundis entitled \"[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNL8zG0hsB0 The Ent and the Ent-Wife]\".\n\nIn [[2024]], the song was included as entry 165 in ''[[The Collected Poems of J.R.R. Tolkien]]''. In their commentary, [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] mention that the poem is often referred to as the \"Song of the Ent and the Entwife\".<ref name=\"collectedpoems\"/>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''\n:Treebeard sings a part on the song aloud while on his way to [[Entmoot]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Poems in The Lord of the Rings|Poems in ''The Lord of the Rings'']]\n\n{{references}}\n{{poems}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Song of the Ent and the Entwife, The}}\n\n[[Category:Poems in The Two Towers]]"}}}
