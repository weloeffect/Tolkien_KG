The news brought by Ceorl caused Théoden to reconsider his strategy, and he rode instead to join Erkenbrand at Helm's Deep, so setting the stage for the mighty [[Battle of the Hornburg]].<ref name=\"HD\"/> \n\n==Etymology==\nLike other [[Rohirrim]], Ceorl's name comes from [[Old English]]. It refers to a particular rank in Anglo-Saxon society (also known as [[Carl (disambiguation)|Carl]] and [[wikipedia:churl|Churl]]), in fact the lowest rank possible while remaining a freeman. Historically, these people would not normally have been professional soldiers, so if Ceorl's background follows his name, we might guess that he was a farmer or tradesman who had been pressed into military service to help deal with the imminent threat to [[Rohan]].\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Ceorlin adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Decipher - Ceorl.jpg|Ceorlfrom [[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Ceorl.jpg|Ceorlin ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''\n:Ceorl is omitted.
