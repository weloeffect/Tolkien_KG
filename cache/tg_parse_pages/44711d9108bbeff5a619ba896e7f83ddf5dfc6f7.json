Tolkien]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe theme of ''The Lost Road'' is one of \"Preincarnation\". There are a series of occurrences throughout the [[legendarium]] of father and son duos sharing names that are etymologically connected with [[Amandil]] (\"Bliss-friend\") and [[Elendil]] (\"Elf-friend\"). These include [[Eädwine]]-[[Ælfwine]] of Anglo-Saxon legend, [[Audoin]]-[[Alboin]] of Lombardic, through to \"the traditions of the North Sea concerning the coming of corn and culture heroes, ancestors of kingly lines, in boats\".<ref name=\"Letter257\" /> In the story the present pair, [[Edwin]] and [[Elwin]], travel back through the different phases of the history of their names, eventually reaching the time of Amandil and Elendil and the ''[[Akallabêth]]'' or ''Atalantie'' (\"Downfall\" in [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] and [[Quenya]] respectively) of [[Númenor]].\n\nNúmenor at this stage in Tolkien's thought was not connected with the wider [[legendarium]]. Rather it is a direct analogue of [[Wikipedia:Atlantis|Atlantis]], a \"legend or myth or dim memory\" that had always \"[[Atlantis-haunting|troubled]]\" Tolkien and a theme to which he often returned.<ref name=\"Letter257\" />\n\n==Background==\nIn the chapter \"[[The Early History of the Legend]]\", [[Christopher Tolkien]] explains the conception of the story as a challenge with [[C.S. Lewis]] and how this was developed simultaneously with the chapter \"[[The Fall of Númenor (chapter)|The Fall of Númenor]]\". It is notable that this challenge, although abandoned by Tolkien, resulted in Lewis's successful [[Space Trilogy]]<ref>David Downing. \"Rehabilitating H. G. Wells\", in C.S. Lewis: Fantasist, mythmaker, and poet, ed. Bruce L. Edwards, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007, p.14</ref>, whose [[Wikipedia:Elwin Ransom|protagonist]] is also named Elwin.\n\nHowever, only a fragment of ''The Lost Road'' was ever written: the two opening chapters, and two which take place in Númenor. According to Tolkien, he abandoned the story because \"it was too long a way round to what I really wanted to make, a new version of the Atlantis legend\".<ref>{{L|294}}</ref> He did pass the completed chapters on to [[Allen & Unwin]] in [[1937]] as a possible successor to ''[[The Hobbit]]''. However, the publishers felt that even if it was finished, the story was unlikely to be a commercial success.<ref name=\"Letter24N3\">{{L|24|3}}</ref>\n\nThis was not Tolkien's last attempt at integrating the Númenor story into a time travel frame work. He tried a second time a decade later with ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]''. It was only after both these works floundered that the legends of Númenor were finally integrated with the main mythology.<ref name=\"Letter257\">{{L|257}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lost Road, The}}\n[[Category:The Lost Road]]\n[[Category:Manuscripts by J.R.R.
