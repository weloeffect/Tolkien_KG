The track was composed by [[Plan 9]], a group of Kiwi musicians who had previously collaborated with [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Fran Walsh]]. The piece was performed on-set, before Shore joined the project, to provide music for the actors to dance to. When the time came to compose the score, Shore and others decided it was a great composition and left it in the final film.<ref>[https://www.melson.nl/lotr/index.php@view=theme&id=51.html The Lord of the Rings Score Analysis Project - Flaming Red Hair]</ref>\n\n\n{{References}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:1.05}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring - The Complete Recordings]]"}}}
