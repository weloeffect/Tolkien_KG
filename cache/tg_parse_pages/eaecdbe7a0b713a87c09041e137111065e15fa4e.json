Faramir was struck down by a flying dart - it was feared that it was from the Nazgûl and had created a Morgul-wound.<ref>{{RK|V4}}</ref> However, after the great battle [[Aragorn]] examined the wound and found it to be healing. This proved that Faramir had not suffered a Morgul-wound. It had been believed that it was such though due to Faramir's sickness and fever, but Aragorn diagnosed Faramir's condition as due to weariness, grief, wounding, and the [[Black Breath]].<ref>{{RK|V8}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Morgul-knife]]\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Nazgûl]]"}}}
