[[Gwindor]] it was who had only recently escaped from the evil mines of [[Angband]] – the very elf who had fought in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad|Battle of Unnumbered Tears]] and had been taken at the doors of Morgoth.\n\nThere Beleg and Gwindor witnessed a horde of orcs swarm northward and in their midst was Túrin, chained and whipped. The evil soldiers took camp, guarded by wolves in a deep vale; and Beleg came silently with his great bow and shot each wolf dead so that he could steal into the heart of the encampment. There he seized Túrin and took him away.\n\nNow Beleg cut Túrin's bonds with the sword [[Anglachel]]; but misfortune was amongst them and the blade slipped and pricked Túrin's foot. In rage, thinking he was to be tormented by orcs, Túrin leaped forth, and swiftly taking Anglachel, he slayed his attaker, only too late to see it was his friend Beleg.\n\nThere Túrin stood as stone in shock; for his friend lay dead before him.\n\nHe was roused only by Gwindor to help in burying Beleg, and the mighty bow [[Belthronding]] was laid upon his breast; but dark Anglachel Túrin took himself to take vengeance on Morgoth.\n\nThen Gwindor took Túrin in his grief and they passed away westward to the calm and holy [[Eithel Ivrin]] where Túrin shook off his grief and was healed of his madness. There he sang the [[Laer Cú Beleg]], the [[Song of the Great Bow]], in memory of his friend.\n\nSouthward then they passed to Gwindor’s realm until the elven scouts of [[Nargothrond]] took them as prisoners.\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Death of Beleg}}\n[[Category:The Children of Húrin chapters]]\n[[fi:Belegin kuolema (HLT)]]"}}}
