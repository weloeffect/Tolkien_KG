Although the [[Elves]] defeated the eastern host of Orcs it was a costly victory (his ally, [[Denethor (Nando)|Denethor]] of [[Ossiriand]], was killed with all his kin) and the western force of Orcs were successful in driving [[Círdan]] to the shores. Thingol therefore withdrew his people into Neldoreth and Region, and Melian used her power to encircle this dominion with an invisible wall of shadows and bewilderment.
