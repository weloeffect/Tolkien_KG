''Dwale'' would be a nick-name of one particular Hobbit, and the name was derived from [[Old English]] ''dwale'', \"dull\".<ref name=\"lviii\">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], Undated note part of ''[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings|Nomenclature]]'', cited in {{HM|RC}}, p. lviii</ref> \n\nIt is notable that ''dull'' and ''dwale'' ([[Gothic]]: ''dwals'' \"fool\") are cognates of Tol- in [[Tolkien|'''Tol'''kien]] (German: '''''toll'''kühn'', \"foolhardy\").<ref>{{L|165}}, p. 218</ref> Tolkien himself has translated his own name into Gothic as ''Dwalakōneis''.<ref name=\"lviii\"/><ref>[[Mark T.

It is the first Shire settlement to be overrun by southern ruffians, who have already moved in and began pusing out the Hobbits by October of [[Third Age 3018]].\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Cities, towns and villages of the Shire]]\n\n[[de:Nachtschatten]]\n[[fi:Valinkka]]\n[[fr:encyclo:geographie:villes tours et forteresses:comte:dwaling]]"}}}
