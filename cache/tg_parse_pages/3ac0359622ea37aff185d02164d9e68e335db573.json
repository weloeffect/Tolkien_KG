Released in 2014, the story takes place between ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', acting as a bridge between the two eras. The protagonist's name is Talion, a [[Gondorian]] [[Ranger]] stationed at the [[Black Gate]]. Talion's family is slain the night the Dark Lord [[Sauron]] and his [[Uruk-Hai]] forces return to reclaim [[Mordor]], setting the Ranger on a quest for revenge after he is possessed and sustained from death by a mysterious [[Wraith]].\n\nThe game received generally favorable reviews upon it's release, with most of the praises were about its combat, open-world design, and the Nemesis System, although it received some criticism about the game's story and boss battles. This game marked the biggest launch for a video game based on Tolkien's universe, and would go on to win several awards from video gaming publications, including [[wikipedia:List of Game of the Year awards|Game of the Year]]. It was followed by a sequel, [[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]], which was released in October 2017.\n\n==Plot synopsis==\nThe family of [[Talion]], a ranger who guards the black gates into [[Mordor]], is brutally killed by the Black Hand of Sauron. Talion is also killed but is brought back to life merged with a wraith that gives him inhuman powers. He ventures into Mordor to exact revenge and to help the [[Celebrimbor|wraith]] find his past identity and what brings the two together.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Shadow of Mordor'' is an open-world action/adventure game that is set entirely within Mordor.<ref>{{webcite|author=Chris Plante|articleurl=http://www.theverge.com/2014/10/1/6881161/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-torture-terrorism|articlename='Shadow of Mordor' is morally repulsive and I can't stop playing it|dated=31-May-2011|website=[http://www.theverge.com The Verge]|accessed=July 29, 2015}}</ref> The overworld is mainly populated by [[Uruk-hai|Uruks]], as well as never-before-seen creatures, such as the cat-like Caragors and troll-like Graugs.\n\nOne defining feature of the game is the Nemesis System, which allows the game to remember Uruks of a certain notability and track their progress as they rise from lowly soldiers to high-ranking captains and even war-chiefs. Most of these Uruks are randomly-generated and can vary in appearance, name, personality, and strengths/weaknesses. the Captains can randomly be found among the anonymous masses, though the war-chiefs can only be encountered by completing certain objectives to draw them out of hiding.\n\nThere are a number of tactics and strategies that can be exploited to kill Uruks: In addition to killing them in normal combat, one can also poison a nearby barrel of grog and let Uruk-hai drink from it, grapple them and throw them over the edge of a cliff or platform, set Caragors loose on them by breaking open their cages, launch sneak attacks from above or behind, or \"brand\" Uruks with the Wraith's powers to brainwash them and pit them against other Orcs.\n\n==Differences between versions==\nThe Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game are severely lacking in comparison to their counterparts for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One: The PS3/360 versions features a simplified Nemesis system, poor framerate, longer loading times, and Graugs are very rarely encountered outside of missions. As such, the hunting challenges involving the Graugs and their variants are omitted from these versions of the game.\n\n==In Depth Summary==\nThe family of Talion, a ranger of Gondor who guards the Black Gates into Mordor, is brutally killed by the Black Hand of Sauron and his two subordinates, the Hammer of Sauron and the Tower of Sauron, when Sauron's forces move to reoccupy Mordor after the [[Battle of Five Armies]]. Talion is also killed via a cut throat but is brought back to life merged with a elven wraith that gives him inhuman powers. He ventures into Mordor to exact revenge and to help the wraith find his past identity and what brings the two together. Through a series of quests with [[Gollum]], Talion and the wraith find relics that give the wraith his memories back in the form of visions. After completing all three Gollum Quests, the wraith is revealed to be Celebrimbor, the elven blacksmith who was tricked into forging the rings of power by Sauron during the [[Second Age]]. Talion also reunites with a fellow ranger, Hirgon of Tarnost and in a series of missions saves Hirgon's wife, poisons orc grog, and helps the rangers destroy a statue of Sauron in Mordor. Talion and Celebrimbor also meet an orc named Ratbag the Coward. Talion frees Ratbag from his binds and makes a deal; Ratbag will rank up in Sauron's army as long as he helps Talion kill the warchiefs. After three quests, Ratbag becomes a warchief and the deal is ended. After all of the previous missions, Talion attracts the attention of The Hammer of Sauron. The Hammer kills Ratbag, the only remaining warchief, for his incompetence and Talion kills the Hammer.\n\nA young warrior-woman, Lithariel, approaches Talion and invites him to come hold audience with her mother, Queen [[Marwen]] of the coast of Nurnen, who wishes to treat with Celebrimbor. The ranger and wraith go to the coast of Nurnen, and the ailing mystic Marwen coaxes Celebrimbor and Talion into the realization that they can control orcs—including captains. Spurred by the idea that controlling the orc command structure can give them an army to challenge the Black Hand, the pair begin taking over orcs and manipulating the orc infighting to elevate their servants to command. Along the way, Talion meets a dwarf named Torvin, who teaches Talion about hunting and helps him retrieve one of Celebrimbor's past possessions, which have uniformly triggered memories and insight in the elf's life. The elderly Marwen's malaise worsens, and Talion helps retrieve medicine for her. It's revealed that her illness isn't age or her own straining efforts at seeing the future, but the malign influence and control of Saruman. Saruman almost succeeds in remotely breaking the bond between Talion and Celebrimbor, which would kill the ranger, when Lithariel breaks the staff her mother got from Saruman and severs the connection between the two. Marwen wishes to leave Nurnen with their tribe. Lithariel, on final raids with her warriors, is captured and Talion rescues her from an uruk stronghold. In gratitude, Marwen uses her influence with the local sailors to arrange passage for Talion and his force of orcs to the stronghold of the Black Captains. There Talion battles the Tower of Sauron, who prefers to torture the mind rather than fight the body. Among other things, the Tower reveals that Celebrimbor deliberately chose Talion's body as a host, and that Celebrimbor uses Talion to exact his revenge on Sauron. Celebrimbor also helped Sauron refine the Ring. Talion slays the Tower, and the ranger and wraith quarrel briefly but resolve to continue their partnership at least until the Black Hand, last of Sauron's captains, is defeated.\n\nUpon their return to Nurn, they find Queen Marwen's stronghold has been attacked by orcs, and the Queen and her followers are nowhere to be found. The orcs came chasing a relic of Celebrimbor's, which was kept hidden by Gollum, who's kept trailing Talion and Celebrimbor in the hopes they'll lead him to the One Ring. Talion touches the relic and relives the near-end of Celebrimbor's memories—that Celebrimbor had stolen the One Ring from Sauron, and used it against Sauron for a time, commanding his own army of dominated orcs. The pair decide to go confront the Black Hand—who has made his base at the Black Gate. After a pitched battle with the Hand's own personal band of orc war-chieftains, the pair reach him. The Hand, surprisingly, doesn't resort to a physical confrontation. He reveals the failure of Celebrimbor's campaign—Sauron was almost bested, but as the maker and true master of his Ring, he was able to magically pull it from Celebrimbor's finger to his own, and then overwhelm the elf-lord. The vision over, the Black Hand cuts his own throat to make himself a vessel for Celebrimbor, using his magic to steal the wraith from Talion.  Then, with Celebrimbor's spirit in him, the Black Hand channels Sauron and becomes his master's giant armored form. A dying Talion manages to avoid \"Sauron's\" attacks, and then the resisting Celebrimbor freezes the Hand to give Talion time to strike him down.\n\nThe weakened Talion's vision clears in the unseen world of the wraith, and he stands over the slain Black Hand. Celebrimbor wearily believes they can't beat Sauron and he's willing to move on with Talion and let the ranger reunite with his family in the beyond. Talion, though, questions if Celebrimbor could really rest in peace if he did nothing further to fight Sauron. Celebrimbor is swayed by the ranger's argument, and bonds with him once more. Alive and strong again, Talion stands on the Black Gate and looks towards the newly-erupting Mount Doom, and declares it is time for a New Ring.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"=\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!
