Tolkien]]'s translation of the [[wikipedia:Book of Jonah|Old Testament Book]]. Tolkien's translation was based on a French text and was not a direct translation of the original Hebrew. It was published in ''[[The Jerusalem Bible]]'' in [[1966]].\n\nThe published text, however, does not represent Tolkien's original work, as it incorporates changes made by other editors. The original, unmodified text was published in the ''[[Journal of Inklings Studies, vol.4 no.2]]'' in [[2014]], and was commentated by Brendan N. Wolfe.\n\n==From the publisher==\n{{blockquote|A beautiful new presentation of one of the best-loved Bible stories in a translation by J.R.R. Tolkien. Editor Brendan Wolfe tells the little-known story of how Tolkien, then at the height of his fame as the author of ''The Lord of the Rings'', agreed to join the team of Catholic writers and scholars working on a major new translation of the Bible into English in the early 1960s. The result was the Jerusalem Bible, still celebrated for its elegant, timeless English. Wolfe shows the resonances between the story of Jonah and the whale, Tolkien's contribution to the JB, and themes in his other writings.}}\n\n==Planned book==\n''The Book of Jonah'' was intended to be published as a separate book in [[2010]] by Darton, Longman & Todd.
