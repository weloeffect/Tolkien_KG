Some [[Men]]—mostly related to the [[House of Hador]] of [[Beleriand]]—settled between the [[Grey Mountains]] and [[Greenwood]], and they allied with the [[Longbeards]] against Morgoth's [[Orcs]].<ref name=relations>{{PM|Relations}}</ref>  This alliance ended in the [[Second Age]] after [[Sauron]] destroyed [[Eregion]], which prompted the Longbeards to seal Moria. During this time, Orcs took control of the Grey Mountains.<ref name=relations/>\n\n===The Awakening of Durin's Bane===\nDurin's folk started to gather in the Grey Mountains in {{TA|1981}} after [[Balrogs|Durin's Bane]] was awakened in their ancestral home of [[Khazad-dûm]], which its people fled in fear. Another portion of [[Durin's folk]] lead by King [[Thráin I]] established the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] founded the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] in {{TA|1999}}<ref name=\"Durin\">{{App|Durin}}</ref> at [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. \n\nAround {{TA|2000}},<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry \"Scatha\"</ref> many centuries before [[Durin's Folk]] established a kingdom in the Ered Mithrin, [[Scatha]], a mighty [[Long-worms|Long-worm]] of the [[Grey Mountains]] and one of the greatest [[Dragons]] to infest that range of the north,  had plundered treasure from the [[Dwarves]] and kept it in his hoard. He was slain by [[Fram]] son of [[Frumgar]] in the early days of the [[Éothéod]]. His recovered hoard was the subject of great dispute between the [[Éothéod|Men of the Éothéod]] and the [[Dwarves]] of that region, who claimed the hoard as their own. Fram rebuked their claim, and sent them the teeth of the dragon, with the words, \"Jewels such as these you will not match in your treasuries, for they are hard to come by.\" It was rumoured that for this insult the Dwarves killed him.<ref name=\"App|Eorl\">{{App|Eorl}}</ref> \n\n===The Seat of Durin's Realm===\nIn {{TA|2210}} King [[Thorin I]], learning that most of his people were gathering in the Grey Mountains, left the Lonely Mountain to join the Dwarves to the north, for those mountains were rich and little explored.<ref name=\"Durin\">{{App|Durin}}</ref>\n\n===The War of the Dwarves and Dragons===\nFor many years, Durin's folk prospered in the Ered Mithrin but, the dragons of the [[Forodwaith]] eventually multiplied and became strong, and in {{TA|2570}}<ref name=\"AppB\">{{App|B2}}</ref> the Dragons made war on the dwarves, sacking and plundering their halls. The Dwarves held out for around twenty years, but finally in {{TA|2589|n}}<ref name=\"AppB\"/> the Dragons attacked the halls of King [[Dáin I]]. King Dáin, and his second son [[Frór]], were killed by a [[Cold-drake]] outside his door to his halls.<ref name=\"Durin\"/>\n\nFollowing the death of their king, most of [[Durin's Folk]] abandoned the Grey Mountains. In {{TA|2590|n}},<ref name=\"AppB\"/> King [[Thrór]] and his uncle [[Borin]] returned to the Erebor with the [[Arkenstone]] to re-establish the Kingdom under the Mountain. However, Thrór's younger brother [[Grór]] led others to the [[Iron Hills]].<ref name=\"Durin\">{{App|Durin}}</ref>\n\n===Later History===\nThere still was a remnant of the Dwarves in the Ered Mithrin after the core of the population left.<ref name=\"Durin\">{{App|Durin}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Dwarven peoples]]\n[[de:Ered Mithrin#Bewohner]]\n[[fi:Harmaavuoret#Historia]]"}}}
