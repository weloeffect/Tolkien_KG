With Ibun, Khîm fled into the mist, but a stray arrow fired by one of the outlaws struck him as he fled. Though he escaped back to Mîm's halls beneath [[Amon Rûdh]]—no doubt with his brother's help—his wound was mortal, and he died before his father returned.<ref name=\"Mim\"/>\n\nTúrin and his companions came to dwell in Mîm's house, which became known as the [[House of Ransom]], in part because of Khîm's premature death. The archer who shot him, an outlaw named [[Andróg]], was cursed by Mîm, and forced to break his bow.<ref>{{CH|7}}, p. 132</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| | | MIM | | |MIM=[[Mîm]]<br /><small>''d. {{FA|502}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| |,|-|^|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree| IBU | | KHI |IBU=[[Ibun]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA}}''</small>|KHI='''KHÎM'''<br /><small>''d. {{FA|486}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Khim}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Children of Húrin]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Petty-dwarves]]\n[[Category:Dwarves]]\n[[Category:Khuzdul words]]"}}}
