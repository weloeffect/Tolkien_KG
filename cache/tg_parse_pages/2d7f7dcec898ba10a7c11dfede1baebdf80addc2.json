By this way, letters and news was passed between the four [[Farthings]]. \n\nNot all [[Hobbits]] were lettered but those that were wrote constantly to friends and family. Mail was typically used to communicate with those more than a day's walk away.<ref name=\"Ordering\" />\n\nThe office of the [[Mayor of Michel Delving|Mayor]], in his capacity as [[Postmaster]], was responsible for its efficiency. The Messenger Service was one of two Shire-Services, the other being the [[Watch]]. The Messenger Service was the much busier of the two with numerous Hobbits working as Messengers in contrast to the only twelve [[Shirriffs]] and the [[Bounders]] (During the time in which [[Saruman]] controlled the Shire these numbers were greatly increased.)<ref name=\"Ordering\" /><ref name=\"Scouring\" />\n\nWhile not explicitly stated, mail was likely delivered twice a day as this was the case in England at the time of writing there is a mention of Bilbo reading his morning mail.<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref>\n\nIn the days leading to [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]], [[Bilbo Baggins]] sent hundreds of invitations all around [[Hobbiton]] and [[Bywater]], followed by hundreds of responses; the respective post-offices were blocked or overwhelmed, and volunteer postmen came to assist.<ref>{{FR|Party}}</ref>\n\n==Quick Post==\nThe [[Quick Post]] was apparently the speediest way to send information within [[the Shire]]. Tolkien stated that the Messenger Service and the Watch were the only Shire-services with all other services falling under the category of these so the quick post was almost certainly part of the Messenger Service.<ref name=\"Ordering\">{{FR|Ordering}}</ref> When the [[Chief Shirriff|Chief]] had taken control of the Shire he used the old Quick Post service to gather information.<ref name=\"Scouring\">{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The term \"Quick Post\" is used exclusively. It is the Shire's mail delivery service and is responsible for the timely and confidential delivery of letters, which the Hobbits write to each other in great numbers. The players can join the Quick Post and assist them in various deliveries between the towns and villages of the Shire.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Organisations in the Shire]]\n[[de:Postzustellung im Auenland]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/hobbits/metiers/service de messagerie]]\n[[fi:Lähettipalvelu]]"}}}
