Tolkien himself, some of these not appearing in print for many years. The paintings are based on Tolkien’s classic masterpiece, The Lord of the Rings, and provide a fascinating insight into how Tolkien himself imagined the world of Middle-earth would look. The images are accompanied by informative text which explains how they relate to the story and offers information on their content and history.<br/><br/>Published to coincide with a special 50th anniversary edition of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, the diary (together with the calendar) will initiate the start of a big year for the Nation’s Favourite Big Read and Book of the Century.}}\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Tolkien Calendar 2005]]''\n\n{{title|italic}}\n[[Category:Diaries]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
