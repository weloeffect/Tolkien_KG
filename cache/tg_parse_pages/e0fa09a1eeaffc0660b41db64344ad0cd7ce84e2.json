Tolkien]] in [[Letter 165]] ([[30 June|June 30]], [[1955]])}} \n\nA lot of people misspell \"[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]\" as '''Tolkein'''. This was already the case in Tolkien's time; several passages in ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'' show Tolkien's frustration about the matter. \n==History==\nThe first recorded use of ''Tolkein'' stems from [[1901]]. The ''Blue Book'' of [[King Edward's School]] in [[Birmingham]] for January of that year includes in the list of pupils: \"[''Name.''] Tolkein … … [''Initials.''] J.R.R. [''Class.''] xi [''Date of Birth.''] 3.1.92 [''Came.''] 00/3 [=third quarter of 1900] [then ''Placed.'' in class] xi [''Parent's Initials.''] Mrs. [''Address.''] 214, Alcester Road [''Business.''] Independent\".<ref>''King Edward's School Blue Book, January 1901'', seen and copied in Birmingham Central Library, Local Studies & History Department, 16 August 2005</ref>\n\nIn [[1922]], [[Oxford]] bookseller [[wikipedia:Basil Blackwell|Basil Blackwell]] in ''[[Fifty New Poems for Children|Fifty New Poems for Children: An Anthology Selected from Books Recently Published]]'' included the poem ''[[Goblin Feet]]'', which he ascribed to a J.R.R. Tolkein. The name appears in the table of contents, above the poem and in the index.<ref>[http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/dmiller/000454.htm Fifty New Poems for Children] at [[Pieter Collier|Tolkien Library]]</ref>\n\nLater, the name was used, according to Tolkien, by college, bank, and lawyer's clerks,<ref name=\"L324\">{{L|324}}</ref> and more or less all who wrote to him.<ref>{{L|347}}</ref>\n\n==Origin==\nThe name ''Tolkien'' has often been associated with Jewry. This was in turn because the Jewry of the time had predominantly Yiddish and German names, and the Tolkien family hailed from Saxony, Germany.<ref name=\"L324\"/> Since these Yiddish and German names often ended in ''-stein'', it may have been a hypercorrection. \n\n==Other notable occurences==\n* The Index of ''[[Pictures under Discussion]]'' has \"Tolkein, J.R.R.\".\n* One of the songs of the [[Brobdingnagian Bards]] was titled \"[http://www.thebards.net/music/lyrics/Tolkien_Lord_of_the_Rings.shtml Tolkein (The Hobbit & The Lord of the Rings)]\", but it has been renamed since.\n* The manual of the videogame ''[[Wikipedia:Dragonsphere|Dragonsphere]]'' credits the works of \"Tolkein\" as inspiration of the game designers.\n* Early prints of the stamp ''The Hobbit'', issued by the [[Wikipedia:Royal Mail|Royal Mail]] in [[1998]] for the set ''Magical Worlds: Classical Fantasy Books for Children'', featured the name \"Tolkein\".<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.tolkienshop.com/contents/en-uk/d172.html|articlename=Royal Mail|dated=|website=[http://www.tolkienshop.com/index.html The Tolkien Shop]|accessed=11 January 2011}}</ref>\n* Early copies of a reissue of [[Lin Carter]]'s ''[[Tolkien: A Look Behind The Lord of the Rings]]'' in [[2003]] featured the word \"Tolkein\" on the cover. It has been corrected since.\n* A plaque in [[University of Oxford#Pembroke College|Pembroke College]] commemorates a donation from the [[Saul Zaentz|Saul Zaentz Trust]] in honour of \"J.R.R. Tolkein\".<ref>{{webcite|author=Daniel Helen, various|articleurl=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10157702402420532&set=gm.10154570428076068&type=3&theater|articlename=Tolkien Society Facebook group post|dated=30 November 2016|website=FB|accessed=30 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n===Tolkein===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Fifty New Poems for Children - Goblin Feet.jpg|\"[[Goblin Feet]]\" in ''[[Fifty New Poems for Children]]''.\nFile:The Hobbit (stamp).png|The Royal Mail \"Tolkein\" stamp.\nFile:Saul Zaentz Tolkein plaque, Pembroke College, by Daniel Helen.jpg|The Pembroke College \"Tolkein\" plaque.\n</gallery>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Fandom]]\n[[Category:Tolkien Family]]"}}}
