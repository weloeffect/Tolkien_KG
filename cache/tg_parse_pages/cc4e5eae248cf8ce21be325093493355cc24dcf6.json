Possibly the single most important term in Tolkien's critical lexicon, with a complex of referents. He used it to mean the Otherworld beyond the five senses - a parallel reality tangential in time and space to the ordinary world; he used it to mean the practice of enchantment or magic, especially through the use of words, for example spells or charms; and he used it to mean the altered mental or psychological state brought about by such practise. Tolkien deliberately employed the variant spelling in place of the more conventional \"fairy\", to distance himself and his reader from that spelling's connotations of daintiness and prettiness. Over the course of time, he experimented with various but always archaic spellings, including Faery and Fayery, but remained ever faithful to the same set of meanings.|\"[[On Fairy-stories]], Editor's Commentary\" in [[Tolkien On Fairy-stories]] Expanded edition, with commentary and notes\n}}\n\nThe name 'Faerie' belongs to an early period of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s writings, and is never seen in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', but it does survive in a single usage in the earlier book ''[[The Hobbit]]'' where this high idea takes on a more concrete form, and there it relates specifically to the realms occupied by the Elves beyond the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]].<ref>{{H|Flies}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fairies]]\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Eldamar]]\n[[fi:Haltiamaa]]"}}}
