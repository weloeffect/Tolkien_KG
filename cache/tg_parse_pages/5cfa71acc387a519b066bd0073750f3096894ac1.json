The Rohirrim halt, with [[Théoden]] coming to the front to see the status of Minas Tirith. Théoden weeps and knows that the Rohirrim are significantly outnumbered, seeing the massive armies of [[Minas Morgul]]. [[Éowyn]] and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] see the armies of [[Mordor]], with Éowyn urging Merry to remain hopeful and courageous. Éomer also goes to the front to see the armies as well. While the [[Orcs]] are reforming their ranks to attack these new foes, Théoden turns round and orders the last preparations to charge into the ranks of the Orcs. Théoden gives his order for the ranks, and brings the Rohirrim to accept their possible fate of Death, and to ride for \"a red day!\" \nThe Rohirrim give their battle-cry of \"DEATH!!\" Merry and Éowyn join in these battle-cries, as Éowyn accepts her fate in this battle. Théoden leads the forces of [[Rohan]] into battle, on his horse [[Snowmane]]. The Orcs fire their arrows at the Rohirrim, however they shoot few of the riders of [[Rohan]]. They fire two more times, however too few Rohirrim fall, and the Riders ram their forces into the side of the armies, with many orcs being slain by being run over by the riders and horses of Rohan. The armies are weakened as the Rohirrim charge through the ranks of the armies.\n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King scenes|46]]"}}}
