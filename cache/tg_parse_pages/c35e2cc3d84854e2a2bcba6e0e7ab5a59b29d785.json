Tolkien]] opened the window on a whole new world that has captured millions of imaginations and changed the face of literature forever. But this story of unexpected adventure is far more than [[Orcs|goblin]] attacks, [[Dragons|dragon]]-hoards, and riddles in the dark. It's a journey that changes a simple hobbit named Bilbo-and-us along the way.\n\nJim Ware, coauthor of the best-selling ''[[Finding God in The Lord of the Rings]]'', once again unlocks the mysteries of [[Middle-earth]] with insightful reflections on the scenes and characters of ''[[The Hobbit]].'' You'll discover the deep connections that link this fantasy world to our own, and unveil the mysterious workings of the Author of the Tale in your own life.\n\nJust as the very ordinary Bilbo Baggins was caught up in a web of momentous events beyond his understanding, so you also are part of a larger story. Travel to Middle-earth to discover some ways in which God is still very much at work in our world—and has a bigger purpose for you than you can ever imagine.\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Religious books]]"}}}
