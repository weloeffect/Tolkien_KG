He is a [[Eagles|giant Eagle]] and joined [[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]], [[Andriel]] and [[Farin (video game character)|Farin]] on their quest. The player can summon him to aid in fights against enemies.\n\n==History==\nDuring the early stages of the [[War of the Ring]] Beleram was sent by his lord, [[Gwaihir]], to search for news. While he flew over [[Fornost]] he saw an army of [[Orcs]] and [[Goblins]] assembling. There he was taken out of the air by siege weapons and Orc [[Magic|sorcerers]], and captured.<ref name=\"Main Gate\">[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Main Gate''</ref>\n\nShortly after his capture Eradan, Andriel and Farin enter Fornost and, after killing jailers, free him. After introducing each other they make a plan to destroy siege weapons.<ref name=\"Main Gate\"/> Beleram attracted the attention of the Orcs and Goblins while Eradan, Andriel and Farin make their way up to the battlements and destroy the siege weapons.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Battlements''</ref> Beleram meets Eradan, Andriel and Farin again at the outer wards of the city where he thanks his new friends. In return Beleram aids them in their mission to kill [[Agandaûr]]. He also tells them that he has seen two [[Half-elves]], [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]].<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Outer wards''</ref>\n\nAt the Citadel of Fornost, Beleram aids Eradan, Andriel and Farin protecting Elladan and Elrohir, who try to remove the magic which protects the citadel gate. When the others go inside, Beleram remains to stop reinforcements from entering the citadel.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''The Citadel''</ref> When Agandaûr attempts to flee on the back of a [[Fell beast]], Beleram pursues him. Agandaûr, however, summons a thunderstorm. A lightning hits Beleram, and he returns to the citadel tower. Here he discuss the events in Fornost with Eradan, Andriel, Farin, Elladan and Elrohir. With [[Tharzog]] - leader of the Orcs - dead and Agandaûr fled, they agree that their mission is done. Beleram returns to the [[Misty Mountains]] to inform Gwaihir.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Citadel tower''</ref>\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings - War in the North - Beleram.png|thumb|Beleram atop [[Bargrisar]] - ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'']]\nBeleram returned to aid the trio when they fought the [[stone-giants|stone giant]] [[Bargrisar]] in the [[Ettenmoors]]. After ripping the creature's eyes out, Beleram was joined by Gwaihir, who, after some consideration allowed Beleram to continue assisting the trio's quest. Beleram was accompanied by two fellow eagles, [[Baranthor]] and [[Armanel]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Images of Beleram|Images of Beleram]]\n*[[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]]\n*[[Andriel]]\n*[[Farin (video game character)|Farin]]\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Eagles from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: War in the North characters]]\n[[fi:Beleram (pelihahmo)]]"}}}
