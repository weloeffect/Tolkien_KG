He was considered the strongest of the [[Noldoli]], and was like considered third greatest in valour.<ref name=\"LT2\">{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|174}}\n\n{{Quote|Who now shall fear the Balrogs for all their terror?

When the gate was broken, he stirred his kindred against the Balrogs with words of passion, and though many were slain, they slew a number of the fiery creatures \"that... was a marvel and dread to the hosts of [[Melko]], for ere that day never had any Balrogs been slain by the hand of Elves or Men\". Seeing that they had no way back, Rog rushed his men outside the city, where the folk of the Hammer were hemmed in, and every one of them perished, including him.<ref name=\"LT2\"/>{{rp|178–9}}\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''Rog'', in earlier writings ''Rôg'', seems curious as a name for an elf-lord of Gondolin: no other one-syllable names appear in other writings.\n\nThe meaning or etymology of the name is unclear, and in the context of the later works it would mean \"Demon\" (cf. ''[[raug]]''), in [[Sindarin]], as an element in ''[[Balrog]]''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry \"[[RUK]]\"</ref><ref>{{WJ|P4}}, p. 415</ref> But the early ''[[Gnomish Lexicon]]'' gives an adjective: ''rôg'', ''rog'' (\"doughty, strong\"), related with ''arog'' (\"swift, rushing\") and ''raug'' of the same meaning.<ref>{{LT2|Appendix}}, entry \"Rog\"</ref> The [[Qenya]] form of his name was ''Rōka''.<ref>{{PE|13}}, p. 104</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nRog's death \"without the walls\" is mentioned in the ''[[Quenta Noldorinwa]]'',<ref>{{SM|Quenta}}, p. 144</ref> which was the main text used by [[Christopher Tolkien]] for his edition of the chapter \"[[Of Tuor and the Fall of Gondolin]]\" within ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.
