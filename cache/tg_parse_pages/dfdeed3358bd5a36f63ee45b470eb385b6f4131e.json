He and [[Gelmir (messenger of Círdan)|Gelmir]] were sent on a journey by Círdan as messengers and during their travels they met both [[Tuor]] and [[Túrin]].\n\n==History==\nArminas and Gelmir were sent by [[Círdan]] to [[Nargothrond]] after Círdan had received a message from the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Ulmo]].  Their journey went by ship to [[Drengist]] first, to seek for the [[Gondolin|Hidden Kingdom]] of [[Turgon]] but they did not find it.<ref name=\"Fall\">{{CH|11}}</ref>  While journeying inland they came upon [[Tuor]] who was seeking the [[Gate of the Noldor]] and they helped him by taking him part of the way through the great tunnel.<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}, pp. 21-22</ref>\n\nAfter spying upon the gathering of [[Orcs]] in the [[Pass of Sirion]] they then travelled south to deliver Ulmo's message to King [[Orodreth]].  The message was that Nargothrond should shut its doors and that the bridge before the doors should be demolished to prevent a creeping evil from finding the gate.<ref name=Nargothrond>{{CH|11}}, p. 173</ref>\n\nAt this time Orodreth relied upon the counsel of Túrin, who scorned the words of the messengers,<ref name=Nargothrond /> for it was upon his advice that the [[Bridge of Nargothrond|bridge]] had been built and it was his policy for the King's forces to go forth openly to war.<ref>{{CH|11}}, pp. 161-163</ref>  Arminas then asked Túrin if he was of the [[House of Hador]].  This question greatly angered Túrin, for in Nargothrond he wished to be known only as [[Agarwaen]] and did not want it known that the son of [[Húrin]] resided in the fortress.  In turn, Arminas became angry and upbraided Túrin for his lack of courtesy and unwillingness to listen to the advice of others.<ref>{{CH|11}}, pp. 173-175</ref>\n\nArminas and Gelmir then left, and their message was ignored, leading to the destruction of that citadel by [[Glaurung]].<ref name=\"Fall\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Arminas'' is [[Sindarin]] for \"Royal Tower\", from ''[[ar]]'' (\"high, royal, noble\") + ''[[minas]]'' (\"tower\").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3793469383.html|articlename=S.
