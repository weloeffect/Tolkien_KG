After the destruction of the northern gate, they marched there to help, but a force of [[Orcs]] led by [[Balrogs]] surprised them, and they fought in the market for hours. Then a [[fire-drake]] appeared and they were overwhelmed, so Glorfindel had to retreat with the few men he was left. With the fire of the dragon, all the market was burned down, along with its stores and fair workmanships. King [[Turgon]] had sent the [[host of the Harp]] to help there, but their own lord [[Salgant]] lied to them and took them to the [[Lesser Market]], where he dwelt. Realizing the treachery, the men of the Harp abandoned their lord and went back in time to save Glorfindel. With great wrath but leaderless, they pushed the enemy back to this market, where the fire of the dragon consumed many of them.<ref>{{LT2|III}}, pp. 182-3</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Gondolin]]\n[[Category:Great Lands]]\n[[fi:Suuri kauppatori]]"}}}
