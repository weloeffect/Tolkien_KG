Valian Years finally ended with the first rising of the [[Sun]] towards the end of the [[First Age]].\n\nBoth Trees had equal and consistent cycles where they would each wax, come to full bloom and light, and then wane and cease to shine. This cycle, starting with the flowering of [[Telperion]], they deemed a \"Valian Day\".<ref name=AAm>{{MR|P2a}}</ref>{{rp|§29}}\n\nTwice during each Valian Day, as one Tree waned and the other waxed, there was a period of softer light when both Trees were faint and their gold and silver mingled.<ref>{{MR|P3I2}}</ref>{{rp|§17}} The duration of this period the Valar deemed a \"Valian Hour\", and it was one twelfth of a Valian Day.<ref name=AAm/>{{rp|§29}}\n\nHence a Valian Day would comprise the following:\n* Hours 1 - 5: Telperion shines alone in full bloom\n* Hour 6: Telperion wanes and [[Laurelin]] waxes, their lights intermingle\n* Hours 7 - 11: Laurelin shines alone in full bloom\n* Hour 12: Laurelin wanes and Telperion waxes, their lights intermingle\n\nEvery 1000 Valian Days, the Trees would put forth a new branch and their stature would increase. This length of time the Valar deemed a Valian Year.<ref name=AAm/>{{rp|§29}}\n\n== Relation of the Trees to the reckoning of the Sun ==\nThe amount of actual time consumed by these cycles changed throughout the evolution of the legendarium.\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s, the length of the Valian Year fluctuated slightly around a round number of 10 [[Years of the Sun|solar years]]. \n\nIn the ''[[The Annals of Aman]]'', a direct correlation was made with one Valian Hour being equal to seven solar hours. Thus, a Valian Day was 84 solar hours long, and a Valian Year was 84,000 solar hours. This then translates to a Valian Year being 9.582 solar years long.<ref>{{MR|P2c}}</ref>{{rp|§§5–10}}\n\nIn 1959, Tolkien came up with a new scheme for Valian Time (VT). In this, one Valian Day was equal to one [[löa]] (a solar year) and all multiplications or divisions of time were by 12. Increasingly, 12 Valian Days made a ''Valian Month'', and 12 Valian Months made a Valian Year (a [[yén]], equalling 144 löa). A Valian Day was divided into 12 Valian Hours, which were further divided into ''Primes'', ''Seconds'', ''Terces'', ''Quarts'', ''Quints'', ''Sexts'', and lastly ''Minims''.<ref>{{NM|Divisions}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Years]]\n[[de:Valisches Jahr]]\n[[fi:Valarin vuodet]]"}}}
