''[[et]]'' \"out\").<ref name=Helge>[[Helge Fauskanger]], \"[http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/quen-eng.htm Quettaparma Quenyallo]\" at [http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/ Ardalambion] (accessed 27 October 2011)</ref>\n\nRobert Ireland links ''Ekkaia'' to the [[Sundocarme|root]] KHAYA (\"far, distant\"), which appears to include among its derivatives an adverb similar in form: ''ekkaira'' (\"far off, far away\").<ref name=quick>Robert Ireland, [http://www.quicksilver899.com/Tolkien/SILM/SILM_CE.html The Silmarillion Dictionary (C-E)] at [http://www.quicksilver899.com/Tolkien/Tolkien_Dictionary.html A Tolkien Dictionary] (accessed 27 October 2011)</ref><ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 364 (entry KHAYA-)</ref>\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nEkkaia appears first time in [[The Later Quenta Silmarillion]], replacing the earlier concept of [[Vaiya]]. In earlier works such as the ''[[Ambarkanta]]'', Vaiya is not a sea, but an exotic material that encloses the flat [[Ambar]], becoming air above it, and water below it. In the published ''[[Silmarillion]]'' Ekkaia is clearly mentioned only to be a sea. However in the cosmological models of ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'' (and fan-made maps), Ekkaia is conflated with the earlier concept of Vaiya, shown as an atmospheric layer that encloses the world.\n\nThe published ''Silmarillion'' mentions an unnamed chasm beyond Ekkaia into which the Moon plunges. [[Christopher Tolkien]] later wrote that this reference comes from a note from his father,<ref>Cf. {{AA|177}}</ref><ref>{{SM|5e}}, p.241, footnote</ref> but that he actually settled with the Chasm to lie ''before'' the Outer Sea, rather than beyond it.<ref name=\"MR|P2r\"/> This seems to be derived from the earlier concept of the [[Chasm of Ilmen]] that lies between Ambar and Vaia, but it is hard to understand it with the concept of Ekkaia as a sea.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Vaiya]]\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Quenya locations]]\n[[Category:Seas and oceans]]"}}}
