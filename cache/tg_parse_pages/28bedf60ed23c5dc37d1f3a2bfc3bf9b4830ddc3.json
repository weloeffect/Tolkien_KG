They grew out of the wall of a valley at the southern end of the [[Misty Mountains]], and were worked by the early [[Gondorians]] so that they formed a complete defensive circle around the tower. They were torn down by the Ents to make way for the [[Treegarth of Orthanc]] at the end of the Third Age.\n\n[[Category:Walls]]\n[[fr:encyclo:geographie:regions:gondor:cercle d isengard]]\n[[fi:Rautapihan kehä]]"}}}
