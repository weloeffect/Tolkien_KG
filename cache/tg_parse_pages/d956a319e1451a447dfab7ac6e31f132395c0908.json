They were called '''''Tunglin''''' ([[Noldorin]] for \"folk of the Harp\"), as their joy was in the wild music.<ref>{{SM|P1}}, p. 4-5</ref>\n\nIn the later [[legendarium]], the motif of the swan remained: in ''[[Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin]]'' is said that the swan was the token of Tuor's foster-father [[Annael]] and his folk, who were indeed \"men of the North\", dwelling in [[Mithrim]].<ref name=Gondolin />{{rp|205}}<ref>{{UT|1}}, p. 25</ref> \n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Mannish noble houses|Swan]]"}}}
