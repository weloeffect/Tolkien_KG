He married a woman named Elyen and they had two children. For four years, he lived a peaceful life, composing a book on enchantments.\n\nThis tranquil period ended in {{SA|1998}}, when a plague swept through his homeland. Ren barely survived the illness, but it left him with a twisted mind, instilling in him the delusion that he was the ''Fire King'', a son of the volcano Ulk Chey Sart. His sanity slowly eroded, and his horrified wife tried in vain to find a cure.\n\nAt the end of {{SA|1999}}, Ren gathered a cult of followers and declared himself the Overlord of the Chey. He ruthlessly subjugated the tribes in his regio, and by the end of the next year, he had become the King of the Chey in truth.\n\n[[Sauron]], observing Ren's ruthless march, saw great potential in the mad enchanter. In {{SA|2001}}, Ren accepted a [[Nine Rings|Ring of Power]], becoming the eighth King to fall under Sauron’s sway.”\n\nNon-believers were purged, including his own family, and the population of the tribes fell to half of what it had been before the Plague. Ren led two great expansions between {{SA|2155}} and {{SA|3261}}, using a system of horse-roads and garrison holds to consolidate his conquests.\n\nAfter the [[Downfall of Númenor]], he joined his master in [[Mordor]], where he passed into shadows as Sauron was overthrown in the [[War of the Last Alliance]].\n\nRen reappeared around {{TA|1050}}, re-establishing his volcanic hold and expanding it into a great underground citadel. In {{TA|1235}}, he began subjugating neighbouring tribes, unifying them in {{TA|1264}}. He ruled under the moniker of the Fire King to hide his identity, bringing a period of prosperity to the Chey people.\n\nDuring the [[War of the Ring]], Ren rode with the Black Riders in search of the One Ring. Afterwards, he organized Mordor's main army from [[Barad-dûr]] and then fought at the [[Battle of the Morannon]], where he perished with Sauron's defeat.<ref name=ICE/>\n==Weaponry in Middle-earth Role Playing==\nBeyond a [[Morgul-knife]], the Ringwraith is noted to have possessed the following weapons:\n*'''Burning Blade''': A [[galvorn]] two-handed sword, with a red edge. Its hilt was made of red copper and the guard of golden [[Stones_in_Middle-earth_Role_Playing#Laen|laen]].<ref>{{ICE|2010}},  p. 20</ref>\n* '''Believers' Bane''': An enchanted composite bow.<ref>{{ICE|2010}},  p. 19</ref>\n{{References}}\n{{Nazgûl in adaptations}} \n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nazgûl 8}}\n[[Category:Undead from adaptations]]\n[[Category:Middle-earth Role Playing characters]]"}}}
