These sheep are depicted briefly in the prologue of the first film, ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey|An Unexpected Journey]]'', as part of the refugee caravans of dwarves exiled from [[Erebor]], and then much more prominently in ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|The Battle of the Five Armies]]'' During the titular battle, specially trained sheep are ridden by some of the dwarven sodiers and warriors from the [[Iron Hills]], used as an unusual form of cavalry capable of fighting in mountainous terrain. These sheep are referred to as \"war rams\" (albeit Dáin Ironfoot also calls them \"goats\", perhaps colloquially). [[Thorin Oakenshield]] borrows a war ram for a hasty gallop towards [[Ravenhill]].<ref>The dwarven \"war rams\" of the films were depicted almost exclusively though computer generated imagery blended with live footage of \"riding\" actors. Greg Tozer was one of the Weta Digital concept artists who worked on the design of these creatures, with further information on the process documented in the tie-in book ''The Hobbit: The Art of War: The Battle of the Five Armies''. The sheep's appearance is partly inspired by real life [[wikipedia:Mouflon|mouflons]].</ref><ref>These dwarven sheep are strictly non-canon, as even ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' book series implies Tolkien's dwarves rarely kept any domesticated animals of their own, not even dogs. It is therefore possible the dwarves of Middle-earth might not bother raising any sheep breeds of their own.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Mámandil]]\n*[[Uimoth]]\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Animals]]"}}}
