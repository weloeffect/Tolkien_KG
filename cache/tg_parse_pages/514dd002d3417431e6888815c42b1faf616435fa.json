On the top of the hill grew two circles of trees: an outer circle of leafless trees with snow-white bark and an inner circle of ''[[mallorn|mallorn-trees]]''. In the centre of the inner circle stood a very tall tree with a white [[flet]] built high amid its branches.<ref name=\"Lorien\">{{FR|Lorien}}, p. 350</ref> \n\n==History==\nThe hill received its name, Cerin Amroth (\"Amroth's Mound\"), in the [[Third Age]] when [[Amroth]], the [[King of Lórien]], lived in the high trees in the fashion of the [[Silvan Elves]] on the hill. The main function of the flet on the hill was to watch the fortress of [[Dol Guldur]].<ref>{{UT|Amroth}}</ref> The hill retained its name after Amroth left his kingdom with his lover [[Nimrodel]] and many other Elves of Lothlórien in {{TA|1981}}.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1981, p. 1087</ref>\n\nOn the evening of Midsummer<ref>{{App|Tale}}, p. 1060</ref> of {{TA|2980}} [[Aragorn]] and [[Arwen]] promised to marry each other on Cerin Amroth.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2980, p. 1090</ref>\n\nOn 17 January {{TA|3019}},<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019, January 17, p. 1092</ref> the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], except [[Gandalf]] who had fallen off the [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm]], briefly visited Cerin Amroth.
