He married [[Menegilda Goold]] and had two sons, [[Saradoc Brandybuck|Saradoc]] and [[Merimac Brandybuck|Merimac]]. He became [[Master of Buckland]] after his father's death in {{SR|1363}}.<ref name=\"Brandybuck\">{{App|Brandybuck}}</ref>\n\nAfter the deaths of his sister, [[Primula Brandybuck]] and her husband [[Drogo Baggins]] in {{SR|1380}}, Rorimac took their son, [[Frodo Baggins]] under his guardianship in [[Brandy Hall]] for nine years. [[Bilbo Baggins]], a kinsman of Drogo, often enjoyed Old Rory's hospitality, and eventually he proposed that Frodo could come with him to [[Hobbiton]].<ref name=party>{{FR|Party}}</ref>\n\nRorimac was present at [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]]. After Bilbo's [[Unseen|disappearance]], Rory was one of the first, if not the only, to suspect \"Mad Baggins\" was off on an adventure again, and told so to his [[Esmeralda Took|daughter-in-law]] to quiet her shock; he expressed satisfaction that there was more food to feast with and promptly asked his nephew Frodo for more wine. As part of his departure, Bilbo left him a dozen of bottles of [[Old Winyards]], and as soon as he tasted the first one, Rory voted Bilbo a capital fellow.<ref name=party/>\n\nRory died six years later, passing on the title of Master of Buckland to his eldest son [[Saradoc Brandybuck|Saradoc]].<ref name=\"Brandybuck\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] noted that the names of the Bucklanders had a vaguely [[Celtic]] style.<ref name=\"Translation\">{{App|Translation}}, p. 1135</ref>\n\n''Rory'' is a northern Irish form of the [[Celtic]] name ''Rhuadri'' or ''Rhuaidri'', which means \"red\" or \"ruddy\". An ancient Irish hero wasd called Rory O'More. Rory or as a full name ''madadh ruadh'' (\"red dog\") is the common name for the fox in many Higland tales where the fox is portrayed as shrewd. This is a fitting name for Rory Brandybuck, because we are told about him that \"neither age nor an enormous dinner had clouded his wits\".<ref>{{HM|IE}}, \"Giving of Names\", p. 204</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n| race=hobbit\n| house=[[Brandybuck Family]]\n| born={{SR|1302}}\n| died={{SR|1408}}\n}}\n{{seq\n| prev=[[Gorbadoc Brandybuck]]\n| list=[[Master of Buckland|Master]] of [[Buckland]]\n| dates={{SR|1363}} - {{SR|1408|n}}\n| next=[[Saradoc Brandybuck]]\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n\n{{masters}}\n[[Category:Brandybuck]]\n[[Category:Celtic names]]\n[[Category:Hobbits]]\n[[Category:Masters of Buckland]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[de:Rorimac Brandybock]]\n[[fi:Rorimac Rankkibuk]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/hobbits/brandebouc/rorimac brandebouc]]"}}}
