It was long and oval with a shape like a great spear-head. The deep water of Mirrormere was dark blue like a clear evening sky seen from a lamp-lit room and had a still surface. Close to the southern end of the lake stood a column with a broken top, which was called [[Durin's Stone]].

He looked down in it and saw a [[Durin's Crown|crown]] above his head, being the reflection of stars above. Taking the crown as a sign, he founded the great city of Khazad-dûm beneath the mountains that fed Mirrormere.<ref>{{FR|Journey}}, p. 316</ref> A pillar called [[Durin's Stone]] was placed along the banks of the lake to mark the event.<ref name=Lorien/>\n\nOn 10 November {{TA|2994}}<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2994, p. 1090</ref> [[Balin]], the [[Lord of Moria]] was shot from behind by an [[Orcs|Orc]] when he went alone to Dimrill Dale to look into Mirrormere.<ref>{{FR|Bridge}}, p. 322</ref>\n\nDuring the events that led up to the [[War of the Ring]], on 15 January {{TA|3019}}<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019, January 15</ref> the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] passed by the lake after escaping [[Moria]]. Despite their hurry, [[Gimli]] would not leave without looking in the lake.
