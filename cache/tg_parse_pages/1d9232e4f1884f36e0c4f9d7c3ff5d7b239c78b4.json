[[Nienna|Fui]] would judge Men after they had died, sending some to [[Halls of Mandos|Mandos]] or [[Angband|Angamandi]], but sending others to [[Avathar|Arvalin]] aboard the ship [[Mornië]]. Of those sent to Arvalin, some very few would be retrieved by Nornorë, who brought them by chariot to dwell in [[Valmar]] until the [[Dagor Dagorath|Great End]].<ref>{{LT1|III}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[Chaining of Melkor|Chaining of Melko]], Nornorë ran before Manwë's chariot when the host of the Valar marched against [[Utumno|Utumna]]. As herald of the Gods, he was sent into the depths of [[Utumno|Utumna]] to speak before the seat of [[Morgoth|Melko]] with cunning words contrived by the Gods. The ruse worked: Nornorë convinced Melko that the Gods had come to pay him homage. Melko, blinded by his pride, allowed Manwë and the rest of the Gods entry to his halls. Once inside, they were able to capture him and put him in chains.<ref>{{LT1|IV}}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Eldar]] awoke in [[Palisor]], Nornorë was sent to them by the [[Valar|Gods]] as [[Manwë]]'s ambassador. Coming to Koivië-néni, he invited some of them to come with him to Valinor. [[Ingwë|Isil Inwë]], [[Finwë|Finwë Nólemë]], and [[Thingol|Tinwë Lintö]] heeded his call and he brought the three of them before the Gods, and then returned them to their folk at Koivië-néni. Upon returning, they convinced many of the Eldar to seek the Gods, and Nornorë brought the news to Valinor that the host of the Elves would indeed make the long journey west.<ref>{{LT1|V}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Nornorë'', also appearing as '''''Nornoros''''', is a [[Qenya]] name, derived from ''nornoro-'' (\"run on, run smoothly\"). The [[Gnomish]] version of his name is '''''Drondor''''' (later '''''Dronúrin''''').<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, p. 263</ref> He was also given other names: Qenya '''''Kapalimor''''' (derived from ''kapalima'' \"bounding, leaping\"; Gnomish version '''''Cablin''''') and Qenya '''''Vastor''''' (derived from ''vastan'' \"rush, of both noise and speed\").<ref>{{PE|14}}, p. 13</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nNornorë did not appear in later versions of the legendarium. His role as herald of the Gods came to be filled by [[Eönwë]], and [[Oromë]] became the Vala responsible for bringing Ingwë, Finwë, and [[Thingol|Elwë]] to Valinor as representatives of the Eldar and then returning them to Cuiviénen.\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nornore}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Qenya names]]\n[[Category:Valar]]"}}}
