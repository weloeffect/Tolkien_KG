It appears in their sixth full-lenght album, [[Oath Bound]].\n==Lyrics==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nRivers of fire, the dead of night \nIn winter lying cold and white \nUpon the plain burst forth and high. \nThe red was mirrored in the sky. \n\nFrom Hitblum's walls they saw the fire, \nThe steam and smoke in spire on spire \nLeap up, till in confusion vast \nThe stars were choked. And so it past \n\nThere trumpets sang both long and loud, \nAnd challenge rang unto the cloud \nThat lay on Morgoth's northern tower, \nWhile Morgoth redeemed for his hour. \n\nMight and glory flowing for a changing dawn \nAncient power reveals from an iron crown \n\nClear and cold and shining so far and bright \nCrush the world in one clash of your blinding light\n</poem>\n[[Category:Songs by Summoning]]"}}}
