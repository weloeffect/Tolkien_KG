Their main food were [[lopoldi]], helping the [[Númenóreans]] to keep them in order. As they were seldom hunted or because they had enough food with the lopoldi, they never attacked the fowls of the Númenóreans.<ref>{{NM|P3xiii}}, pp. 334-335</ref>\n\nIn the [[Third Age]], a fox became puzzled at finding [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] asleep in a [[Firs|fir-wood]] on the first night of their journey from [[Hobbiton]], thinking that there was ''“something mighty queer behind this”''.<ref>{{FR|I3}}</ref> Another fox was encountered by [[Aragorn|Strider]] and the hobbits as they hiked through the [[Chetwood]] after leaving [[Bree]].<ref>{{FR|I11}}</ref>\n\n==Other names==\nThe [[Quenya]] word for \"fox\" is '''''rusco''''', pl.
