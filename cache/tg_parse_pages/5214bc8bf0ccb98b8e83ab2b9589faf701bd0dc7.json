Tolkien]]'s works. It mainly holds the copyright over the literary texts. [[Christopher Tolkien]] and his sister, [[Priscilla Tolkien]], were executors. Current executors of the estate include Christopher's second wife [[Baillie Tolkien]] and Christopher's nephew [[Michael George Tolkien]]. Cathleen Blackburn of Manches & Co. has been the estate's solicitor for many years.\n\nThe film and merchandise rights for ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit]]'' were sold by J.R.R. Tolkien, and are currently owned by [[Middle-earth Enterprises]], formerly known as Tolkien Enterprises, a company currently controlled by [[Embracer Group]], while the television rights of these two books remained with Tolkien Estate.\n\nOn [[13 November]] [[2017]], it was announced that [[Amazon Studios]] had acquired the television rights of ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit'', committing to a [[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power|multi-season television series]]. The series is not a direct adaptation of both of these novels, but instead it features stories that are set before the events of ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref>{{webcite|author=Samuel Axon|articleurl=http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/11/amazon-will-run-a-multi-season-lord-of-the-rings-prequel-tv-series/|articlename=\nAmazon will run a multi-season Lord of the Rings prequel TV series\n|dated=13 November 2017|website=[http://arstechnica.com arstechnica]|accessed=22 March 2021}}</ref> [[Amazon.com Incorporated|Amazon]] said that the deal included the potential production for a spin-off series as well.<ref>{{webcite|author=Sandra Gonzalez,|articleurl=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/13//entertainment/lord-of-the-rings-tv-series-amazon/index.html|articlename=\nAmazon announces 'Lord of the Rings' TV show\n|dated=14 November 2017|website=[http://edition.cnn.com CNN Edition]|accessed=22 March 2021}}</ref> The press release referred to \"previously unexplored stories based on J.R.R.
