This set included a facsimile-reproduction of the first edition of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', a CD of archive recordings of J.R.R. Tolkien reading from ''The Hobbit'', a copy of [[Thror's map]], and a booklet with a brief history of ''The Hobbit'' by [[Christina Scull]] & [[Wayne G. Hammond]].\n\n==From the Publisher==\n{{blockquote|This sumptuous gift set includes a replica of the very rare [[The Hobbit 1st edition|first edition]] of The Hobbit, the only edition where one can now read the original version of the story before Tolkien re-edited it to become the one enjoyed by readers since [[1951]].\n\nThe Hobbit was published on [[21 September]] [[1937]], with a print run of 1,500 copies. With a beautiful cover design, nearly a dozen black & white illustrations and two black & red maps by the author himself, the book proved to be popular and was reprinted shortly afterwards. History was already being made.\n\nThe scarcity of the first edition has resulted in copies commanding huge prices, way beyond the reach of most Tolkien [[Tolkien fandom|fans]]. In addition, subsequent changes to the text – particularly those to [[Riddles in the Dark|chapter 5]], when Tolkien decided in [[1947]] to revise the text to bring it better into accord with events as they were developing in its ‘sequel’, [[The Lord of the Rings]] – mean that the opportunity to read the book in its original form and format has become quite difficult.\n\nThis special commemorative gift set includes the first edition, so that readers of all ages – not just ‘children between the ages of 5 and 9’, as [[Rayner Unwin]] famously declared in his report on the original submission – can finally enjoy Tolkien’s story as it originally appeared. It also includes an exclusive CD of archive recordings that capture Tolkien reading from The Hobbit, a special copy of Thror’s map which reveals the secret moon-runes when held to the light, and an accompanying booklet that relates the history of The Hobbit, and includes connected writings by JRR Tolkien.|HarperCollins}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://harpercollins.co.uk/products/the-hobbit-facsimile-gift-edition-lenticular-cover-j-r-r-tolkien HarperCollins Product Page]\n\n[[Category:The Hobbit editions]]"}}}
