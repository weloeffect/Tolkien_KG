The [[Vanyar]] and the [[Noldor]] were taken to [[Aman]] on that island, but the first Elves to remain there for any time were the [[Teleri]], who lived on the island long after it was anchored off the coasts of [[Aman]]. After a while, though, the Teleri left, to dwell on the strands of the [[Blessed Realm]] itself, and especially at the haven of [[Alqualondë]]. \n\nAfter the [[War of Wrath]] at the end of the [[First Age]], [[Tol Eressëa]] was again peopled with Elves, by the exiles returning from [[Middle-earth]] who settled there. Their shoreland city was at [[Avallónë]], and they built up a great friendship with the [[Númenóreans]], at least during the early part of the [[Second Age]]. \n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Elves of Eressea}}\n[[Category:Falmari]]\n[[Category:Elven peoples]]"}}}
