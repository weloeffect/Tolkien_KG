He also disovered modern historical philology in Gothic.<ref>{{L|163}}</ref> Around [[1910]] or later, Tolkien had bought his tutor [[Joseph Wright]]'s ''[[Wikipedia:Grammar of the Gothic Language|Primer of the Gothic Language]]'' from a school-friend (who had mistaken it for a Bible Society product). He had been fascinated by Gothic and started \"converting\" words of other Germanic languages into Gothic script, which he wrote in his book, and signed as ''Ruginwaldus Dwalakōneis'' (gothicized \"Ronald Tolkien\"). Tolkien was also aware of the tragic history of the Goths.<ref>{{L|272}}</ref>\n\nGothic may have given an impulsion in the first development of [[Qenya]]. Tolkien even attempted to reconstruct some parts of the language and such elements survived in [[Taliska]], the language he created for the [[Edain]] of the [[First Age]]. He also composed a full poem, ''[[Bagmē Blōma]]'' \"The Flower of the Trees\" in Gothic.<ref>[[Tom Shippey]], ''[[The Road to Middle-earth]]'', Chapter 8 On the Cold Hill's Side, Of Birch Hats and Cold Potions, 3rd edition, page 316</ref> [[Tom Shippey]] suggests that Edward Gibbon's ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' stayed in Tolkien's mind and that The Gothic History of Jordanes translated by C.C.

As a consequence, the names of the early kings and princes of the Northmen are of Gothic origin.<ref name=Note6/><ref name=\"Chapter 1 Lit p. 18\"/>\n\n*[[Vidugavia]]\n*[[Vidumavi]]\n*[[Vinitharya]]\n*[[Marhwini]]\n*[[Marhari]]\n*[[Forthwini]]\n\nTolkien also used names of Gothic and Frankish origin that are still in use or appear in real-world history for first-names of old [[Hobbit]] families, especially those of [[Fallohides|Fallowhide]] origin, such as the [[Tooks]] and the [[Bolgers]].<ref>{{App|Translation}}, p. 1135</ref> One example from the Bolger family tree is [[Wikipedia:Odoacer|Odovacar]], the name of a 5th century ruler of Italy of Germanic descent. In addition, Tolkien also used the names Roderic, Alaric, Theodoric and Athanaric in the earliest version of the Brandybuck family tree,<ref>{{PM|Trees}}, BR 1, p. 99</ref> which are of Gothic origin.<ref>Miryam Librán Moreno: J.R.R.
