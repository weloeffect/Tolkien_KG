Like with most of the work of Rúmil, [[Pengoloð]] the Sage expanded it with his words.\n\n==History==\nThe ''Ainulindalë'' or ''The Music of the Ainur'' was written by Rúmil of [[Túna]] in the [[Elder Days]], and was later spoken to [[Ælfwine]] by Pengoloð in [[Tol Eressëa]], in an imprecise context.<ref>{{MR|P1d}}, p. 30</ref> Pengoloð recited to him the ''Ainulindalë'' as Rúmil wrote it, in which it is narrated the [[Creation of the Ainur]], their [[Music of the Ainur|Great Music]], the [[Vision of Ilúvatar]], the Creation of [[Ëa]], the entry of the [[Valar]] into [[Arda]] and the [[First War with Melkor]]. When Pengoloð finished, he paused for a while, until Ælfwine asked him about the Valar and their ancient wars before the coming of the [[Elves]]. Thus, Pengoloð adds to Rúmil's work what he has heard among the loremasters of the Noldor.<ref>{{MR|P1a}}, p. 17</ref> He tells him about the coming of [[Tulkas]], the [[Spring of Arda]], the destruction of the [[Two Lamps]], the creation of [[Valinor]] and [[Utumno]], and the descriptions of the main Valar.\n\n==Real world history==\nThe development of the ''Ainulindalë'' from the earlier version to the published in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' differs very much from the other writings of the [[legendarium]], as [[Christopher Tolkien]] explains:\n{{blockquote|...it is notable that in this case only and in contrast to the development of the rest of the mythology there is a direct tradition, manuscript to manuscript, from the earliest draft to the final version: each text is directly based on the one preceding. Moreover, and most remarkably, the earliest version, written when my father was 27 or 28 and embedded still in the context of the [[Cottage of Lost Play]], was so evolved in its conception that it underwent little change of any essential kind. There were indeed very many changes, which can be followed stage by stage through the successive texts, and much new matter came in; but the fall of original sentences can continually be recognized in the last version of the Ainulindalë, written more than thirty years later, and even many phrases survived.<ref>{{LT1|MusicC}}, pp. 61-62</ref>}}\n\nThrough the volumes of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' there are mentioned nine different manuscripts of the Creation myth, some of them being simple copies or drafts. Here are listed the main texts given by Christopher. The details about their composition can be read within each article:\n\n*[[The Music of the Ainur#The Music of the Ainur|The Music of the Ainur]], written between November [[1918]] and Spring [[1920]]. Published in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]''. \n*[[Ainulindalë (Lost Road)|''Ainulindalë'' B]], written in late [[1930]]s. Published in ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]''. \n*[[Ainulindalë (Morgoth's Ring)#Ainulindalë C*|''Ainulindalë'' C*]], written in [[1948]]. Published in ''[[Morgoth's Ring]]''. \n*[[Ainulindalë (Morgoth's Ring)#Ainulindalë C|''Ainulindalë'' C]], written in late [[1948]]. Published in ''[[Morgoth's Ring]]''. \n*[[Ainulindalë (Morgoth's Ring)#Ainulindalë D|''Ainulindalë'' D]], written in [[1951]]. Published in ''[[Morgoth's Ring]]''. \n\nAs can be seen, in all versions both the tale and the narrative frame are essentially the same: the author is Rúmil, and the tale is told to the human [[Eriol]]/Ælfwine, who is visiting Tol Eressëa. However, for his edition of ''The Silmarillion'', Christopher decided to remove the element of fictional authorship from the main text, including the ''[[Ainulindalë]]''. The attribution to Rúmil remains at the end of the book in the \"Index of Names.\"<ref>{{S|Index}}, entries \"Ainulindalë\" and \"Rúmil\"</ref> ''For an explanation of his edition see [[Ainulindalë#History of composition]].''\n\n{{references}}\n{{title}}\n[[Category:Books and documents within the legendarium]]\n[[Category:Lays and tales within the legendarium]]\n[[de:Ainulindale]]\n[[fr:encyclo/divers/ainulindale]]\n[[fi:Ainulindalë]]"}}}
