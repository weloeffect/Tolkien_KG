Their western end connected to the [[Misty Mountains]] at the site of [[Gundabad|Mount Gundabad]].\n\n==Geography==\nNorth of the Grey Mountains lay the [[Northern Waste]].<ref name=\"UTmap\">{{UT|Map}}</ref> In the west, where the Grey Mountains met with the [[Misty Mountains]] rose [[Gundabad|Mount Gundabad]], an ancient [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] holy site and later the capital for the [[Orcs]] of the north. The eastern end of the Grey Mountains was split into two chains, and in between lay the [[Withered Heath]], where [[Dragons]] bred. After that was a wide hilly plain, beyond which lay the [[Iron Hills]]. [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], the Lonely Mountain, lay south of the Grey Mountains.<ref name=\"UTmap\"/>\n\nFrom east to west the mountains stretched some 350 miles, and the sources of the Great River [[Anduin]], the river [[Greylin]], and the [[Forest River]] of [[Mirkwood]] arose in this range.<ref name=\"UTmap\"/>\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nIn the [[First Age]], the Longbeards established mansions in [[Moria]] and the [[Iron Hills]], and they considered the Grey Mountains, which lay between these mansions, to be within their territory. Some [[Men]]—mostly related to the [[House of Hador]] of [[Beleriand]]—settled between the Grey Mountains and [[Greenwood]], and they allied with the Longbeards against Morgoth's [[Orcs]].<ref name=relations>{{PM|Relations}}</ref>{{rp|302–303}}  This alliance ended in the Second Age after [[Sauron]] destroyed [[Eregion]], which prompted the Longbeards to seal Moria. During this time, Orcs took control of the Grey Mountains.<ref name=relations/>{{rp|305}}\n\n===Third Age===\nDurin's folk started to gather in the Grey Mountains in {{TA|1981}} after a [[Balrogs|Balrog]] was awakened in their ancestral home of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], which its people fled in fear. Another portion of Durin's folk lead by King [[Thráin I]] established the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] founded the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] in {{TA|1999}}<ref name=\"Durin\">{{App|Durin}}</ref> at [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. \n\nAround {{TA|2000}},<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry \"Scatha\"</ref> [[Scatha]], a mighty [[Long-worms|Long-worm]] of the Grey Mountains and one of the greatest [[Dragons]] to infest that range of the north, had plundered treasure from the [[Dwarves]] and kept it in his hoard. He was slain by [[Fram]] son of [[Frumgar]] in the early days of the [[Éothéod]]. His recovered hoard was the subject of great dispute between the [[Éothéod]] and the [[Dwarves of the Grey Mountains]], who claimed the hoard as their own.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Watchful Peace]] most of [[Durin's Folk]] were gathering to the Grey Mountains and in {{TA|2210}} [[Thorin I]] abandoned Erebor and also joined the others.<ref name=\"Durin\">{{App|Durin}}</ref><ref name=\"App|TA\">{{App|TA}}</ref>  Nearly six hundred years later, [[Dragons]] began afflicting the Dwarves.  In {{TA|2589|n}} [[Dáin I]] was slain by a Dragon and the Grey Mountain strongholds were abandoned after the [[Wars of the Dwarves and Dragons]].  About {{TA|2480|n}} [[Orcs]] had begun to infest the [[Misty Mountains]]<ref name=\"App|TA\"/> and spread to the Grey Mountains, such that by {{TA|2941|n}} [[Gandalf]] the Wizard could say that the range was \"simply stiff with goblins, hobgoblins, and orcs of the worst description\".<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>  However, after the [[Battle of Five Armies]] the number of [[Orcs]] in the Grey Mountains were greatly reduced (some three parts of them had perished).<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>\n\nThere still was a remnant of the Dwarves in the Ered Mithrin after the core of the population left,<ref name=\"Durin\">{{App|Durin}}</ref> but were probably few; working whatever mines they could hold from the Orcs and Dragons.\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nAnother line of \"[[Grey Mountains (ancient)|Grey Mountains]]\" in Middle-earth are seen on the [[Ambarkanta]] map.<ref>{{SM|Ambar}}</ref>\n\n== Portrayal in adaptations ==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Ered Mithrin map.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Ered Mithrin in''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'' ]]\n'''2018: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Ered Mithrin is an area in \"The Dwarf-holds\" region. The area consists of the southern slopes of the mountains and the land north of [[Mirkwood|Eryn Lasgalen]], and is accessed by a road going through the [[Dale]]-lands west of Erebor. The Grey Mountains have been settled both by the Longbeards and by a house of Easterling dwarves known as the \"Zhélruka\". They are now inhabited by many lesser [[Dragons|Dragon-kind]] as well as the true Dragons \"Etterfang Foulmaw\", Smaug's sister, and \"Hrímil Frost-heart\". Orcs and Trolls from Gundabad can also be found there.\n\n:The slopes and foothills of the Grey Mountains between Gundabad and the sources of the Anduin were introduced in a later update as the region of \"Elderslade\", site of a war between the Orcs of Gundabad and an army assembled by \"Prince Durin\", son of [[Thorin Stonehelm]].\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Rhovanion]]\n[[Category:Mountain ranges]]\n[[Category:Dwarven realms]]\n[[Category:Evil realms]]\n\n[[de:Ered Mithrin]]\n[[de:Graues Gebirge (Hinnenlande)]]\n[[fi:Harmaavuoret]]\n[[fi:Harmaavuoret (Esiajat)]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/reliefs/rhovanion/montagnes grises]]"}}}
