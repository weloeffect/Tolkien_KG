Lowagie|Quentin Lowagie]]]]\nThe '''Third Age''', often abbreviated to '''T.A.''', began after the first downfall of [[Sauron]], when he was defeated by the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] following the downfall of [[Númenor]].\n\nThis age was characterized by the rise and decline of the exiled Númenorean kingdoms, in contrast to the slow recovery of Sauron's power. In the meantime the [[Elves]], [[Dwarves]] and other peoples did little new; also known as the '''Fading Years''', the [[Age]] marked the waning of the [[Elves]].\n\nIt lasted for 3021 years, only ending after the defeat of Sauron had finally and utterly been achieved by destroying his [[The One Ring|Ruling Ring]]. With the One Ring gone, the power of three rings waned and the realms that had been preserved by them began to fade. These events prompted many of the [[Eldar]] remaining in [[Middle-earth]] to sail for the [[Uttermost West]], and so much memory and beauty were lost to Middle-earth for ever. After the [[Last Riding of the Keepers of the Rings]], the [[Fourth Age]] began.\n\n== Major events of the Third Age ==\n{| rules=\"all\" style=\"border:1px solid darkgrey; border-collapse:collapse\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"\n!\n! style=\"text-align:center\" |Military<ref group=note>Only wars and isolated battles are mentioned as events; for battles being part of larger campaigns, look the campaigns' respective articles</ref>\n! style=\"text-align:center\" |Political\n! style=\"text-align:center\" |Other\n|-\n!|1st millennium \n|\n*[[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]] ([[Third Age 2|2]])\n|\n*Division of [[Arnor]] ([[Third Age 861|861]])\n|\n*Arrival of the [[Wizards]] (c. 1000)\n|-\n!|2nd millennium \n|\n*[[Angmar War]] ([[Third Age 1409|1409]]-[[Third Age 1974|1974]])\n*[[Kin-strife]] ([[Third Age 1432|1432]]-[[Third Age 1447|1447]])\n*[[Corsair Wars]] ([[Third Age 1448|1448]]-[[Third Age 3019|3019]])\n*[[Wainrider/Balchoth War]] ([[Third Age 1851|1851]]-[[Third Age 2510|2510]])\n|\n*Founding of the [[Shire]] ([[Third Age 1601|1601]])\n*Dissolution of Arnor ([[Third Age 1974|1974]])\n*Evacuation of [[Moria]] ([[Third Age 1981|1981]])\n*[[Thráin I]] establishes the Kingdom of [[Erebor]] ([[Third Age 1999|1999]])\n|\n*[[Great Plague]] ([[Third Age 1635|1635]])\n|-\n!|3rd millennium\n|\n*[[Second Fall of Minas Ithil]] ([[Third Age 2002|2002]])\n*[[Ruin of Osgiliath]] ([[Third Age 2475|2475]])\n*[[War of the Dwarves and Dragons]] ([[Third Age 2570|2570]]-[[Third Age 2589|2589]])\n*[[Battle of Greenfields]] ([[Third Age 2747|2747]])\n*[[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]] ([[Third Age 2793|2793]])\n*[[Attack on Dol Guldur]] ([[Third Age 2941|2941]])\n*[[Battle of Five Armies]] ([[Third Age 2941|2941]])\n|\n*Death of [[Earnur]] and end of Kingship of [[Gondor]] ([[Third Age 2050|2050]])\n*[[Thorin I]] leaves Erebor and joins the [[Dwarves of the Grey Mountains]] ([[Third Age 2210|2210]]) \n*[[Oath of Cirion|Founding]] of [[Rohan]] ([[Third Age 2510|2510]])\n*[[Thrór]] re-establishes Erebor ([[Third Age 2590|2590]])\n*[[Saruman]] occupies [[Orthanc]] ([[Third Age 2759|2759]])\n*[[Sack of Erebor]] ([[Third Age 2770|2770]])\n*Dwarves establish [[Thorin's Halls]] ([[Third Age 2802|2802]])\n*Restoration of [[Kingdom Under the Mountain|Erebor]] ([[Third Age 2941|2941]])\n*Establishent of the [[Kingdom of Dale]] ([[Third Age 2944|2944]])\n*[[Balin's Colony]] of Moria ([[Third Age 2989|2989]]-[[Third Age 2994|2994]])\n|\n*[[Watchful Peace]] ([[Third Age 2063|2063]])\n*[[The One Ring]] is found (c.
