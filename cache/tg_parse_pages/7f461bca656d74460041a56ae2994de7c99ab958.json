In the west it bent north a hundred leagues from reaching [[Helcaraxë]].<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, p. 259</ref> \n\n==History==\nOf old the Iron Mountains came close to touching the [[Blue Mountains]] (''Ered Luin'') in the West to the Red Mountains (''[[Orocarni]]'') of the East,<ref>{{SM|A4}}</ref> but in the wars between the [[Valar]] and [[Morgoth|Melkor]] the mountain range was distorted.\n\nMelkor's great fortresses of [[Angband]] and [[Utumno]] were built in the mountains. North of the range lay the regions of ever-lasting cold.\n\nAfter the [[War of Wrath]] the Iron Mountains were broken and disappeared, at least the part of their length that lay directly north of Beleriand.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]], in her book ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'', imagined that remnants of the Iron Mountains after the [[First Age]] could perhaps be all the northern mountain ranges of [[Eriador]] and [[Rhovanion]]: the [[Mountains of Angmar]], the [[Grey Mountains|Ered Mithrin]], and the [[Iron Hills]], still occupied by [[Orcs]] and [[Dragons]] until the [[Third Age]].<ref>[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]], ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'' p. 78</ref> However, this depiction predates publication of ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', where it is revealed that the Grey Mountains and Iron Hills existed in the First Age independently of the Iron Mountains. It was during this age that the [[Dwarves]] of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] first colonized the Iron Hills. They also considered the Grey Mountains, which lay between Khazad-dûm and the Iron Hills, to be part of their territory.<ref name=relations>{{PM|Relations}}, pp. 302-303</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Beleriand]]\n[[Category:Mountain ranges]]\n\n[[de:Ered Engrin]]\n[[fi:Rautavuoret (Esiajat)]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/reliefs/montagnes de fer]]"}}}
