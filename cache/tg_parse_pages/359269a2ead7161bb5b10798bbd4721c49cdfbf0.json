Tall and strong she seemed; for great stature were those of Hador's House...|''[[The Children of Húrin]]'', \"[[The Journey of Morwen and Niënor to Nargothrond]]\"}}</center>\n\n'''Nienor''', also called '''Níniel''', was the second daughter of [[Húrin]] and [[Morwen]] and the sister of [[Túrin]]. Her father was a great foe of [[Morgoth]] and was cursed by the Dark Lord. That curse would also extend to his family, leading to some of the greatest tragedies of the [[First Age]].\n\n==History==\nNienor was born in [[Dor-lómin]], a region in [[Hithlum]], during the year that the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] (\"The Battle of Unnumbered Tears\") was fought. In the aftermath of the battle, her father Húrin was captured, and the treacherous [[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterlings]] had settled into the land of [[Dor-lómin]], oppressing the [[House of Hador|People of Hador]]. Fearing for her son's life, Morwen sent Túrin to the kingdom of [[Doriath]] for safety. As a result, Nienor never knew what her brother looked like.<ref name=\"Departure\">{{CH|4}}</ref>\n\nWhen Túrin had reached Doriath safely, [[Thingol]] had messengers sent to Dor-lómin to have Morwen and Nienor brought to Doriath. While Nienor remained with her mother in [[Dor-lómin]] due to Morwen's pride,<ref name=\"Departure\" /> messengers brought tidings to Túrin of Morwen and Nienor and, as Túrin grew to be taller than many [[Elves]], Nienor grew to be \"a flower in the grey North\". For nine years this continued, until travel to and from Hithlum became more dangerous and Thingol stopped sending messengers, causing Túrin to fear that Morwen and Nienor had met some ill-fate.<ref name=\"Doriath\">{{CH|5}}</ref>\n\nMany years later, due to the actions of the mysterious [[Mormegil]] at [[Nargothrond]], Morgoth's grip over Hithlum was loosened, allowing Morwen and Nienor (whom the Easterling chieftain [[Lorgan]], having heard of her beauty, was eager to take by force)<ref name=\"Wanderings\">{{WJ|Hurin}}, entry for the year 494, p. 256</ref> to escape at last to seek for Túrin in Doriath. Despite finding Túrin gone with no evidence of where he went, Morwen and Nienor were treated in Doriath with honor as the guests of [[Melian]] and Thingol.<ref>{{CH|10}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Fall of Nargothrond]], many survivors fled to Doriath, bringing many rumors which Nienor and her mother heard. Of which, they all claimed that the [[Mormegil]] was actually Túrin. Morwen intended to leave Nienor in Doriath while she journeyed out to seek the truth of Túrin's survival. Nienor wished to stop her mother, but Morwen had left before she could even try. A company of [[Elves]] led by [[Mablung]] set off on Thingol's orders to keep Morwen safe, yet none of them expected that Nienor would sneak into their company. Nienor had initially hoped that she could convince Morwen to turn back, but Morwen refused, and tried to command her to go back to Doriath, but Nienor rebuked her saying that she had a will of her own. In the end, Morwen relented, and Mablung brought them to [[Amon Ethir]] while he sought for tidings.<ref name=\"Journey\" />\n\nUnfortunately, the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Glaurung]] had just sacked the Elven city, and, sensing their approach, caused a cloud of foul vapor to rise from the river [[Narog]]. The guards and horses of Nienor and Morwen panicked fled, and Nienor was thrown from her horse, at which point she decided to not give into despair and climbed the Amon Ethir to gain a better perspective of the situation. Upon reaching the hilltop, Nienor found herself faced with the eyes of the golden head of Glaurung, who happened to have been climbing the other side. Upon the sight of Nienor, Glaurung forced her into revealing that she was the daughter of Húrin, after which he used his enchantments to draw a great darkness filled with emptiness upon Nienor, thrusting her suddenly into a state of total amnesia.<ref name=\"Journey\" />\n\n[[Image:John Howe - Nienor and Glaurung.jpg|left|thumb|250 px|''Nienor and Glaurung'' by [[John Howe]]]]\n\nEventually, [[Mablung]] had returned to Amon Ethir, and intended to take her back to Doriath, but despaired upon the next morning when Nienor stumbled and collapsed. Yet he regained his hope when three of the dispersed guards returned. Though their journey was slow, Nienor slowly regained some of her strength, yet her mind was still blank.<ref name=\"Journey\" />\n\nEventually, after many days, they neared the western border of [[Doriath]], intending to cross the [[Taeglin]] by a guarded bridge near [[Esgalduin]]. When the Elves decided to rest there, they were caught unaware \"by a band of [[Orc-hunters]]\" that roamed the region. Upon waking in the confusion and terror, Nienor let out a cry if alarm and sped into the [[Forest of Brethil]] with the Orcs in pursuit. While the Elves quickly slew the orcs, Nienor was lost to them. Mablung and his company hunted far, between the [[Ered Wethrin]] and the [[Mouths of Sirion]], yet their search was in vain,<ref name=\"Journey\" /> and Nienor fled deep into Brethil, tearing off her garments one by one, and running naked through the forest that whole day until she fainted into \"a deep brake of fern\" when evening came.<ref name=\"Brethil\">{{CH|15}}</ref>\n\nThe next morning, she awoke with a darkness preventing her from remembering anything but a shadow of fear. This shadow of fear made her wary of her surroundings and, as a result, she always searched for \"hidings\", slipping into thickets or climbing trees whenever she became frightened, only going forth again after peering out long with shy eyes. While running in the direction that she first entered the forest, she crossed the river Taeglin after quenching her thirst. Yet she was still cold and famished, not being able to seek any food. Eventually, she stumbled upon a [[Haudh-en-Elleth|green mound]]. Upon sensing the darkness from her past catching up to her, she fell upon the mound, intending to rest, but was prevented when a \"black storm\" of great rain and lightning from the South came upon the forest. Terrified of the thunder, she lay cowering without words as the dark rain fell over her.<ref name=\"Brethil\" />\n\nIn that same hour, a group of [[Haladin]] happened to be passing by, coming from a skirmish against Orcs heading to a shelter nearby. Upon a flash of lightning, they found her, naked and terrified, at the [[Haudh-en-Elleth]]. The leader of the group, a man named Turambar, lifted her up, gave up his cloak to her, and took her to the [[Hunters' lodge]] that they were heading to. When they reached the lodge, a fire was lit and the woodmen wrapped her in coverlets. Upon opening her eyes and glancing on Turambar, she felt comforted, sensing that he was someone from before her darkness. When Turambar asked her for her name, kin, and what evil she had faced, all she could do was shake her head and weep. After giving her food, Turambar asked her the questions again, this time assuring her that she was safe with them. But again, she only wept a second time. At this, Turambar assumed that her story was a sad one and ceased his questioning, giving her the name \"Níniel, Maid of Tears\". Responding, Níniel repeated the name, voicing her approval, saying her first word since her darkness. Níniel rested at the lodge that night before Turambar and the Haladin took her with them to their home upon [[Amon Obel]].<ref name=\"Brethil\" />\n\nUpon halting at [[Dimrost]], Níniel began shivering uncontrollably - so much so that the name was changed to \"Nen Girith, the Shuddering Water\". The woodmen quickened their pace as a result. However, before they reached [[Obel Halad]], Níniel caught a fever.<ref name=\"Brethil\" />\n\nAs Níniel lay sick, [[Brandir]] tended to her, and she was watched day and night by the wives of the woodmen. Yet she was only ever able to lie in peace without moaning whenever Turambar was with her. All throughout her fever, everyone who watched her noticed that she never spoke a word in any language. Eventually, when she was healed and began to eat food again, the women of Brethil taught her word-for-word how to speak again.<ref name=\"Brethil\" />\n\nNíniel loved Turambar and, after three years, they were wed. By the next spring, she was halfway through her first pregnancy.\n\nIt was then that rumors of Glaurung's approach reached Turambar, who went out to slay him. The dragon cast a spell on Turambar as he dealt the worm a mortal blow, and Turambar fell into a swoon. At this moment, Níniel, who feared for her husband's life, arrived and found him apparently dead. The dying Glaurung then removed Níniel's amnesia with his last words, forcing her to confront the revelation that Turambar, the man who she had married, was her own brother Túrin, and that she was carrying his unborn child. Nienor threw herself into the gorge of [[Cabed-en-Aras]].\n\n[[Image:Steamey - The last moments of Nienor.jpg|left|thumb|250px|''The last moments of Nienor'' by Steamey]]\n\nWhen Túrin finally awoke, he was told of Nienor's fate by Brandir, but he refused to believe it, and slew him in anger. Then [[Mablung]] of Doriath arrived and corroborated Brandir's tale. In utter misery, Túrin killed himself on his sword [[Gurthang]].\n\nNienor's body was never found, but her name was written on the [[Stone of the Hapless]] beside her brother's. Years later, the poet [[Dírhaval]] composed the ''[[Narn i Chîn Húrin (tale)|Narn i Chîn Húrin]]'' about the tragedy of the children of Húrin.<ref>{{UT|2n}}, p. 146</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Nienor'' is a [[Quenya]] name meaning \"Mourning\",<ref name=\"Departure\" /> although the only clear element is ''[[nie]]'' (\"tear\"). In ''[[The Children of Húrin]]'', [[Christopher Tolkien]] chose to write Nienor's name as '''''Niënor'''''.<ref>{{CH|Names}}, p. 308</ref>\n\n'''''Níniel''''' is [[Sindarin]] for \"Tear-maiden\",<ref name=\"Brethil\" /> from ''[[nín]]'' (\"tear\") + ''[[-iel]]'' (feminine suffix).\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | BRE | | | | HAL | | HAD | BRE=[[Bregolas]]|HAL=[[Halmir]]|HAD=[[Hador|Hador Lórindol]]}}\n{{familytree | |,|-|^|-|.| | | |!| | | |!|}}\n{{familytree | BEL | | BAR | | HAR |y| GAL | BEL=[[Belegund]]|BAR=[[Baragund]]|GAL=[[Galdor (Lord of Dor-lómin)|Galdor of Dor-lómin]]|HAR=[[Hareth]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |!| | | |,|-|^|-|.|}}\n{{familytree | | | | | MOR |y| HUR | | HUO | | |MOR=[[Morwen|Morwen Eledhwen]]|HUR=[[Húrin|Húrin Thalion]]|HUO=[[Huor]]}}\n{{familytree | | | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|.| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | TUR | | URW | | NIE | | | | TUR=[[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]]|URW=[[Urwen|Urwen Lalaith]]|NIE='''NIENOR NÍNIEL'''}}\n{{familytree | | | |L|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|J| | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn an early pencilled preliminary draft fragment of the tale of ''[[Turambar and the Foalókë]]'', Nienor was called '''Vainóni''', and her spell of forgetfulness was caused by a baneful drink given to her by [[Kurúki]], an evil magician that Vainóni and her mother, [[Mavwin|Tirannë]], stumble across,<ref>{{LT2|IIn}}, pp. 138-9</ref> though the spell was broken by [[Glaurung]] as it is in later versions.
