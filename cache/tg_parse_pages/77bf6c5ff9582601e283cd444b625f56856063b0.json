Pinch, Nab!.jpg|thumb|250px|right|\"Grip, Grab! Pinch, Nab!\" by [[:Category:Images by Blake Henriksen|Blake Henriksen]]]]\n'''Clap! Snap! the black crack!''' is the song sung by the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains|goblins]] as they descend into [[Goblin-town]] after capturing [[Thorin]], the dwarves, and [[Bilbo Baggins]] (but not [[Gandalf]]).  The goblins kept time by the flap of their flat feet upon the stone floor of the passage.  As they sang they brought out whips to force the dwarves and the hobbit to run as fast as they could.<ref>{{H|Hill}}</ref>\n\nThe first stanza refers to the capture of Thorin's company in their \"[[Front Porch]]\", the seemingly small cave the company had taken shelter in while traversing the [[Misty Mountains|mountains]].  The second and third stanzas indicate that the captives will be turned into hard-working slaves of the goblins far within the mountains.\n \n==Poem excerpt==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">Clap!

It has minor differences from the version written in the book translation that the film is based upon,\n\n'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''\n:In the Extended Edition, the Great Goblin is introduced singing the song with the rest of his subjects as the Dwarves arrive, just before he interrogates them. Once he finishes, he asks the Dwarves what they think of his composition. [[Balin]] retorts that it isn't a song, but an \"abomination\". \n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nClap! Snap! The black crack!\nGrip, grab, pinch, and nab!\nBatter and beat!
