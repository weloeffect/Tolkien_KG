While Sam sleeps, Frodo strokes the [[The One Ring|Ring]], but quickly hides it as he hears [[Gollum]] approaching. Gollum tells them they need to move on quickly. He moves off as Frodo and Sam eat some [[lembas]] bread. Frodo learns from Sam that he has been rationing the remaining lembas bread so they will have enough for the journey home. Upon hearing this, Frodo pauses and says nothing. \n\nThe two hobbits trudge through the dying landscape following Gollum who tells them they are now \"very close to [[Mordor]]\". \n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King scenes|02]]"}}}
