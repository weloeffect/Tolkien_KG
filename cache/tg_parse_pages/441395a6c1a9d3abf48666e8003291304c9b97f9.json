In young adulthood, [[Húrin]] and [[Huor]] were involved in an orc skirmish where they were overrun. They were saved by the grace of [[Ulmo]] and taken by [[eagles]] to the hidden city of [[Gondolin]] where they stayed for a year and learned of [[Elves|Elven]] lore. They soon yearned for their own people and were given leave to return to their homeland; however they were forced to swear an oath never to reveal the secrets of Gondolin.\n\nOn his return, Húrin married [[Morwen]], and shortly after [[Túrin]] and [[Lalaith]] were born.\n\n[[File:Alan Lee - The Childhood of Túrin.jpg|left|thumb|''The Childhood of Túrin'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]\nAs Túrin grew up he was loved less than his sister and matured quickly; he had a fierce temper much like his father but was also quick to pity. Sorrowfully, Lalaith was soon consumed by the [[Evil Breath]] and perished, though her beauty was not forgotten.\n\nHúrin was little at home, and Morwen was stern with her children, so Túrin looked toward his friend [[Sador]] for comfort, who was also called [[Hopafoot]] as his foot had been lost to an axe stroke gone awry. Sador was a lowly servant from whom Túrin learned much that he perhaps should have gathered from his mother; but she was a strong woman and cool in her emotions. \n\nAs the [[Great Enemy]] grew, Húrin set out to wage war at the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] leaving his family.\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Childhood of Turin}}\n[[Category:The Children of Húrin chapters]]\n[[fi:Túrinin lapsuus (HLT)]]"}}}
