The game describes them as rough Men, sometimes outlaws, gathered under the banner of Beorn. One of their cultural Virtues is the ability to take control of a 'spirit animal' whilst sleeping, a talent taught to some Beornings by Beorn himself.<ref>{{TOR|Adventures}}, pp. 41-6</ref>\n\n'''2013: [[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]:'''\n:Beorn tells [[Thorin and Company]] that in the past Azog hunted him and his people for sport and that, as a result, few of his kind are left. It is one of his prime motivations to help them in [[Quest of Erebor|their Quest]].\n\n'''2014: [[The Lord of the Rings Online]]:'''\n:The ancestors of the Beornings were taught the art of [[Skin-changers|skin-changing]] as a gift by [[Radagast]] the Brown, \"master of shapes and hues\". Evil men jealous of this gift captured a skin-changer and tortured him until he gave the secret away. Hearing of this, Radagast grieved and changed the gift so it could no longer be taught, only passed down to progeny. But the two new [[Skin-changer]] tribes - \"Gauredain\", men of the wolf, and \"Ungoledain\", men of the spider, - persisted and remained the most bitter enemies of the Beornings, even moreso than the [[goblins]].\n\n:In the present day, Beornings live in and around the [[Vales of Anduin]]. Outside [[Beorn's Hall|Beorninghús]] they have two notable settlements: Limlók, a village to the north, and Vegbár, a toll-collecting station on the road to the [[Misty Mountains]]. Other Beornings live in the wild in small groups or by themselves, as far north as the [[Grey Mountains]], but even those who have little to no contact with their kin to the south still acknowledge [[Grimbeorn]] as their chieftain. All Beornings have a special love for honey-cakes, dedicating a large amount of attention and effort to their baking.\n\n:The Beornings were made playable in 2014, uniquely combining the race and the class. They can transform into the shape of the bear at will and perform skills in both man- and bear-form. The player's character is the youngest child of [[Grimbeorn]] who is sent by their sire to deliver a message to [[Strider]] from [[Radagast]] and takes on the adventuring life. Other Beornings also travel away from their home on various errands, ranging from the [[Lone-lands]] in the west to the [[Elvenking's Halls]] in the east and as far south as the river [[Limlight]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Images of Beornings|Images of Beornings]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://middle-earth.xenite.org/2014/11/05/what-kind-of-army-did-the-beornings-maintain/ What Kind of Army did the Beornings Maintain?] by [[Michael Martinez]]\n\n{{references|n}}\n\n[[Category:Beornings]]\n[[Category:Demonyms]]\n[[Category:Northmen]]\n\n[[de:Beorninger]]\n[[fr:encyclo:peuples:hommes:beornides]]\n[[fi:Beorningit]]"}}}
