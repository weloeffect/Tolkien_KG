Though all but impassable to an enemy, the Gate ultimately failed to prevent the [[Fall of Gondolin]].\n\nThe gate was like a great steel fence across the Orfalch Echor. The fence had seven great needle-like pillars of steel and between these pillars there were seven cross-bars of steel and forty-nine vertical rods with heads like broad blades of spears. In the centre, above the midmost pillar, was raised a mighty image of the king-helm of [[Turgon]], the [[Crown of the Hidden Kingdom]], set about with diamonds. When [[Elemmakil]] struck the gate, rather than opening, the current [[Warden of the Great Gate]], [[Ecthelion]], rode from the north tower on a white horse with an esquire and a company of riders from both towers. The gate opened inward on either side of the pillar of the Crown. This gate followed the [[Gate of Gold]], and when [[Tuor]] and [[Voronwë]] went through, they came to a high sward that looked over [[Tumladen]]. A host of the army of [[Gondolin]] were stationed on either side. The host consisted of representatives from each of the guards of the Seven Gates, likely including members of [[Elemmakil|Elemmakil's]] own [[Dark Guard]]. The captains and chieftains of each Guard sat upon white and gray horses. As Tuor stood before them in the livery of [[Nevrast]], they gazed upon him since many of them were with [[Turgon]] when he first set his armor upon the [[High Seat of Vinyamar]].<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}, pp. 49-50</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n{{gondolin}}\n[[Category:Doors and gates]]\n\n[[de:Sieben Tore von Gondolin#Siebtes Tor]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/villes tours et forteresses/beleriand/gondolin/porte d acier]]\n[[fi:Teräsportti]]"}}}
