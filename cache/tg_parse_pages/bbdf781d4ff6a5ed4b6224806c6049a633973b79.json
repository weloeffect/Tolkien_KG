[[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] did not like him, and even less when they were arguing in ''[[The Green Dragon]]'' about the strange news reaching [[the Shire]] from afar. Ted claimed he didn't believe in [[dragons]] (except the green one) derided Sam's story that his [[Hal Gamgee|cousin Hal]] had seen an [[elms|elm]]-like [[Ent|Tree-man]] walking in the [[North Downs]], and the bystanding hobbits laughed and clapped at his remarks. He also laughed with Sam's sadness for the [[Elves]] leaving [[Middle-earth]], saying that nobody saw them doing so, and considered [[Bilbo]] and [[Frodo Baggins]] \"cracked\" who told Sam about those topics. With that, he drained his mug and went out noisily.<ref>{{FR|Shadow}}</ref>\n\nTed collaborated with [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins|Lotho]] and [[Saruman|Sharkey]], in exchange for a new and much improved mill. When Sam and the [[Travellers]] returned to Hobbiton, Ted taunted Sam over his grief at seeing the [[The Party Tree|Party Tree]] felled and questioned why he returned. When an angry Sam threatened him, Ted boasted of being a friend to the Boss. When he saw the reinforcements riding up behind the Travelers, Ted sounds a horn to warn [[Sharkey]] but Merry promptly winded the [[Horn of the Mark]] to summon the inhabitants of Hobbiton.<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>  Ted's fate afterwards is unmentioned.\n\n==Inspiration==\nIt is possible [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] was inspired by the miller's son, George Andrew junior, at [[Sarehole Mill]], Warwickshire, England.\n\n{{quote|There were two millers [at Sarehole Mill], father and son. The old man had a black beard, but it was the son who frightened the boys with his white dusty clothes and sharp-eyed face. Ronald named him 'the White [[Ogres|Ogre]]'.
