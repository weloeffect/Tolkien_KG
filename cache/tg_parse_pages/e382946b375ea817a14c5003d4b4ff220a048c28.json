It should not be confused with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize maize]. \n\n==History==\nCorn was one of the creations of [[Yavanna]].<ref name=\"Vala\">{{S|Vala}}</ref> Corn grew in [[Aman]] which had in it the strong life of the Blessed Realms. This corn grew swiftly and needed only a little sunlight to ripen, and if it was sown at any season (save in frost), it soon sprouted. This corn was brought to [[Middle-earth]] although it did not thrive and would not endure northern winds that came from [[Angband]]. None were permitted to handle this grain, save the elven-maidens of Yavanna, the [[Yavannildi]], who also knew the art of making [[lembas]].<ref>{{PM|Lembas}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Treebeard]], [[Men]] learned the cultivation of corn by the [[Entwives]] of the [[Brown Lands]], and they were greatly praised for it. That information, however, passed into legend.<ref>{{TT|Treebeard}}</ref>\n\nCorn was also introduced to [[Númenor]], who learned to cultivate it. During the [[Ban of the Valar]], the [[Númenóreans]] spread their knowledge of corn and agriculture throughout [[Middle-earth]], and so, this crop was introduced to the [[Middle Men]].<ref name=\"Aka\">{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>\n\nThe area that would later be known as [[the Shire]] was known for its fertility. The [[Kings of Arnor]] made many farmlands there, and aside from wine, corn was the main produce. Though the land was deserted by the time they came to live there, the [[Hobbits]] continued used their land for similar crop.<ref name=\"Concerning\">{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>  In {{TA|3018}} as he prepared to leave the Shire, [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] noticed that due to the fine weather in the summer and autumn \"the corn was tall and full\".<ref>{{FR|I3}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''\n:Probably due to the dialectical homonym of the New World crop (''[[wikipedia:Maize|Zea mays]]''), [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] and [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] walk through a field of maize.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', \"[[A Short Cut to Mushrooms (scene)|A Short Cut to Mushrooms]]\"</ref>\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Plants]]"}}}
