Annael explained to her how Huor had died, and she left to die at the [[Hill of the Slain]].<ref name=\"Tuor\" /><ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref> Thus Annael became the foster-father of Tuor during his early years.<ref name=\"Quenta\">{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>\n\nAs years passed, in order to seek refuge from [[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterlings]] and [[Orcs]], Annael led his small group of people to the caves of [[Androth]]. When Tuor was sixteen years of age, Annael had to prevent him from going to fight against the enemies of [[House of Hador|his House]], [[Foresight|foreseeing]] that [[Morgoth|Morgoth's]] power would not be defeated until [[Thangorodrim]] [[War of Wrath|was overthrown]], and that they had to march South to [[Annon-in-Gelydh]], which was built by [[Turgon]] long ago. Tuor was much intrigued by the name of Turgon and wished to meet him, but Annael told him how well hidden Turgon's [[Gondolin|realm]] was.<ref name=\"Tuor\" />\n\nDespite having parted in secret from Androth, Annael's people were located and ambushed by a large force of Orcs and Easterlings. The Elves were all scattered, and Tuor was captured. However, Annael and many of his folk escaped [[Dor-lómin]] and joined [[Círdan]] in the [[Mouths of Sirion|distant south]] of [[Beleriand]].<ref name=\"Tuor\" /><ref name=\"Quenta\" />\n\n==Etymology==\n''Annael'' is clearly [[Sindarin]], but it is never glossed. It may contain the [[Quenya]]/[[Sindarin]] elements ''[[anna]]'' (\"gift\") and ''[[el]]'' (\"star\").\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Children of Húrin]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Moriquendi]]\n[[Category:Sindar]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n[[de:Annael]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/elfes/teleri/sindar/annael]]\n[[fi:Annael]]"}}}
