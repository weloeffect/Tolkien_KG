During a [[The One Ring|ring]]-induced dream, [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] dreams of taking the Ring and storming the Tower, but his common sense gains the upper hand in time.<ref>[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]], \"Samwise the Strong\"</ref>\n\n'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''\n:Barad-dûr is one of the first sites visited.

Using the size scale for the model implemented for the films, the Dark Tower is  depicted as being over 1500 meters (5,000 feet) tall.\n:''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' also shows Barad-dûr as clearly visible from the [[Black Gate]] of Mordor. Even granting its enormous size, it was located one hundred miles away and to the east of the Gate, and behind the inner mountain ridges of [[Udûn (valley)|Udûn]] so [[Aragorn]]'s army would probably not have been able to see it. In the film version, the geography of Mordor seems generally to have been compressed somewhat, perhaps for artistic reasons related to rendering such complex stories in a visual medium. In the case of the Black Gate scene, having Barad-dûr visible from the Gate means that the army can see the Eye of Sauron staring at them.\n\n'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''\n:The Tower is briefly visible in the opening scene. [[Galadriel]] narrates a vision from her [[Mirror of Galadriel|Mirror]]. It is only referred to as \"The Dark Tower of Mordor\", and it is the base of the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]] (as opposed to [[Minas Morgul]]). The Eye of Sauron is portrayed as a fiery eye at the top, but is only visible for a split second.\n\n'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'':'''\n:Barad-dûr is shown in the introduction scene. It's design is similar to that of the tower in the movies. It does not play a role in any of the campaigns, and does not appear on any of the maps.\n\n'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''\n:Like in its predecessor, the tower of Barad-dûr plays no active role in this game. In the \"War of the Ring\" mode, it can be seen in the territory of Mordor, but is absent on the map itself.\n\n'''2017: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:With the destruction of the One Ring, the main tower of Barad-dûr had collapsed, but the foundations remain standing and teeming with Sauron's servants. The dungeons of Barad-dûr, the \"Mordath\", have been exposed to the sky above through the cracks in the earth.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Siege of Barad-dûr]]\n*[[Mordor]]\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Barad-dur}}\n[[Category:Fortresses]]\n[[Category:Mordor]]\n[[Category:Towers]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n\n[[de:Barad-dûr]]\n[[fi:Barad-dûr]]\n[[fi:Musta Torni]]\n[[fr:encyclo:geographie:villes tours et forteresses:mordor:barad-dur]]"}}}
