Tom countered the bird by saying that if the bird did tell Old Man Willow, he would burn her and roast her on a willow-spit to end her prying. Willow-wren responded by teasing Bombadil that he would need to catch her first before she reaches Old Man Willow. After Willow-wren flew away from the area, Tom decided to go in that direction anyway to visit [[Hays-end]].<ref name=Bombadil/>\n\nLater, when the [[Otter-folk]] found Tom's boat docked at Hays-end, she helped them loose it alongside [[Fisher Blue]] and [[Old Swan]]. They waited for Tom to come and look for it, but he was already heading for home by the time they loosed his boat, and so they waited for a long time.<ref name=Bombadil/>\n\n{{references}}\n{{legend}}\n\n[[Category:Birds‎]]\n[[Category:Forest-folk]]"}}}
