A precursor to Thû can be found in [[The Book of Lost Tales]] as [[Tevildo]]. The character would later evolve into '''[[Sauron]]'''.\n\n==Lost Tales==\nIn the earlier versions of the story of [[Beren and Lúthien]], the villain was [[Tevildo]], the Prince of [[Cats]].\n\nIn early drafts of that era, ''Túvo'' was a [[fay]] who met Melko in the [[halls of Mandos]] during Melko's imprisonment, and was corrupted by him. Túvo was said to have learned \"much black [[magic]]\" from Melko, and that after the [[darkening of Valinor]], he went to the [[Great Lands]] where he set up a \"wizard kingship\".<ref name=Glo>{{LT1|X}}, p. 234</ref>\n\nHowever, in later texts, the character, renamed Tû, lost these negative connotations, and instead became King of the [[Hisildi]] and the protector of Elves and Men.<ref name=Thu>{{LT1|X}}, ''The Awakening of Men according to the earlier outlines'', p. 236</ref>\n\n==Thû==\nThû, also referred to as the Lord of the Werewolves, replaces Tevildo, and also assumes some of the traits of [[Fankil]]. He is the chief captain of [[Morgoth]], as well as a [[necromancer]] in command of [[Orcs]], [[Phantoms]], [[Werewolves]] and other \"misbegotten or spell-wronged\" foul things.<ref name=FGConclusionp262>{{FG|Conclusion}}, p. 262</ref> \n\nIn the ''[[Lay of Leithian]]'' Thû, also known as ''Gorthû'', holds the [[Wizard's Isle]] and is a [[necromancer]] who controls [[phantoms]]. He spots [[Beren]] and [[Felagund]]. After he interrogates them, he engages with Felagund into a battle of mind and songs, until Felagund's power fell, and they returned to their own original forms. Thû then places them in his dungeons sending a werewolf to devour one of them, hoping to learn their errand.<ref>{{LB|C7}}</ref> Later he sends werewolves, and [[Draugluin]] against [[Lúthien]] and [[Huan]], and takes the form of the greatest werewolf to defeat him. However Huan bites him on his throat and is obliged to give them the keys to his tower. He then transforms into a [[vampire]] and flees.<ref>{{LB|C9}}</ref>\n\nThû is further briefly mentioned in the ''[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]'', in connection with the renown of a young [[Túrin]] on the marches of [[Doriath]]:<ref>{{LB|1b}}</ref>\n<poem>\nEre manhood’s measure   he met and slew\nthe Orcs of Angband   and evil things\nthat roamed and ravened   on the realm’s borders.\nThere hard his life,   and hurts he got him,          \nthe wounds of shaft   and warfain sword,\nand his prowess was proven   and his praise renowned,\nand beyond his years   he was yielded honour;\nfor by him was holden   the hand of ruin\nfrom Thingol’s folk,   and Thû feared him –          \nThû who was thronéd   as thane most mighty\nneath Morgoth Bauglir;   whom that mighty one bade\n‘Go ravage the realm   of the robber Thingol,\nand mar the magic   of Melian the Queen.’\n</poem>\n\nThû escaped the [[War of Wrath|Battle Terrible]] which saw Morgoth's ousting. Following his old master's downfall, his [[Shadow]] falls over Middle-earth and some Men are corrupted to his allegiance, becoming his followers and worshippers.<ref name= FGConclusionp262/>\n\n==Sûr and the Fall of Númenor==\n[[File:Roger Garland - The Haven of Moriondë.jpg|thumb|''The Haven of [[Moriondë]]'' by [[Roger Garland]], depicting Sauron's triumphal arrival to Númenor according to the early version published in ''The Lost Road''.]]\nIn the 1930s, when Tolkien introduced the legend of \"[[Wikipedia:Atlantis|Atlantis]]\" to the Legendarium of the [[Elder Days]], Thû is connected with the [[Downfall of Númenor]]. Known as '''''Sûr''''' in [[Qenya]] and ''Thû'' in [[Gnomish]], he arrives to [[Númenor]] in the form of a great bird, during the reign of King Angor and Queen Istar. In a later version, '''Sauron''' is a conqueror to whom the proud King [[Ar-Pharazôn#Other versions of the Legendarium|Tar-kalion]] summons with messengers; Sauron complied as he was afraid of the [[Númenoreans]] and preferred to destroy them by malice. Approaching the isle, the sea launched his ship upon a hill whence Sauron preached deliverance from death and prophesied the return of Morgoth and among those who believe his lies are Tar-kalion and queen [[Tar-Míriel#Other versions of the Legendarium|Tar-ilien]]. A [[temple]] was built in the midst of the land, where he dwelt. In both versions Sûr/Sauron convinced the king to conquer the West to gain eternal life, events that led to the Downfall.\n\nThe King of the faithful Númenoreans who survived was [[Agaldor]]/[[Amroth]]/[[Elendil]], who allied with the Elven King [[Elrond]]/[[Gil-galad]] of the Elves against Sûr's fortress in the inner land (in the second version of that text, that land is named [[Mordor]] for the first time). In the fight Sûr slays the king but is defeated. In the first text he is driven out to the dark [[Mirkwood|Iron-forest]] in the center of the Earth and the Men destroy his dwellings; in the second text his bodily shape is destroyed for many ages and his servants dispersed.<ref>{{LR|P1II}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Thû'' is related with the [[root]] [[THUS]]-, \"stench, evil mist, darkness\".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 393, entry \"THUS-\"</ref> In subsequent stories, his name evolved to '''''Gorthû''''', '''''Sûr''''', and finally to '''''Thauron''''' (pronounced ''[[Sauron]]'' in common [[Quenya]]), with similar meanings.\n\nIn another source, ''Thū'' is given as a [[Sindarin]] translation of ''Súlimo'', an epithet of [[Manwe]], which shows that the name could also be related with ''[[sûl]]'' (\"wind\").<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 124</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Noldorin names]]\n[[Category:Werewolves]]"}}}
