During the [[Fall of Gondolin]], [[Turgon]] sent Salgant to the [[Great Market]] to reinforce [[Glorfindel]] and the [[house of the Golden Flower]], but being deep in his cowardice, Salgant lied to his company, the [[host of the Harp]], and took them to the Lesser Market. There his men fretted and rebelled from his orders, and came back to the king's halls in time to save Glorfindel.<ref>{{LT2|III}}, p. 182</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Gondolin]]\n[[Category:Great Lands]]\n[[fi:Vähätori]]"}}}
