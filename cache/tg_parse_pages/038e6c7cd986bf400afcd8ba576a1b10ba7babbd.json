This scene was not featured in the theatrical release of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] stand waist-deep in water following the aftermath of the [[Battle of Isengard]]. They watch as [[Saruman]] looks hopelessly out of a window of [[Orthanc]] at the destruction of his work. Pippin realises he is hungry; at this moment, an apple happens to float across his path. Pippin follows a trail of apples and turkey to the storeroom of [[Isengard]]. The two hobbits look in wonder at the multitude of food before them, however their gaze falls on two barrels of pipe-weed; they joyously discover that they have found [[Longbottom Leaf]].\n\nThey debate whether they should share it with [[Treebeard]] before deciding not to. Merry and Pippin then smoke by themselves in the storeroom in delight. \n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers scenes|63]]"}}}
