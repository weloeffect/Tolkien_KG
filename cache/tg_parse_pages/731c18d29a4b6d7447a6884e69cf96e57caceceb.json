The captain of the Hobbitry-in-arms was the [[Thain]], who summoned it at a [[Shire-muster]] in times of emergency.<ref name=\"OrderingShire\">{{FR|Ordering}}</ref>\n\nThe last battle to take place within the borders of the Shire before the [[War of the Ring]], and so presumably the last time the Hobbitry-in-arms was mobilised, was the [[Battle of Greenfields]] in {{TA|2747}} ([[Shire Reckoning|S.R.]] 1147). Hobbits did not fight amongst themselves, and for the next centuries they had been sheltered from the dangers of the outside world by the efforts of the [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]], of which they were largely unaware. By the end of the [[Third Age]] the existence of an armed hobbitry was largely a relic of harder times. What store of weapons remained in the Shire were trophies hanging on walls or displayed in the [[Mathom-house]] at [[Michel Delving]].<ref name=\"ConcerningHobbits\">{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|3019}} a hastily-assembled hobbitry under the command of [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] ejected the [[Ruffians]] from the Shire in the [[Battle of Bywater]]. It is not clear whether this constituted an official mobilisation of the Hobbitry-in-arms, although the contingent from [[Tookland]] was raised by Thain [[Paladin Took II]] and led by his son and heir [[Peregrin Took]].<ref name=\"Scouring\">{{RK|VI8}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Watch]]\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Armies]]\n[[Category:Organisations in the Shire]]\n\n[[de:Hobbit-Wehren]]\n[[fi:Hobittiväki]]"}}}
