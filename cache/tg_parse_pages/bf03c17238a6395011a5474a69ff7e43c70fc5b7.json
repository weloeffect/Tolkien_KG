It is said that they were the descendants of Dwarves who had left their communities as fugitives for some evil deeds, or been driven out, being deformed, undersized, slothful or rebellious.<ref name=Quendi/>\n\n==History==\nThe Petty-dwarves were Dwarves of [presumably] several [[:Category:Dwarven clans|clans]], which descended from Dwarves exiled for evil deeds from the mansions of their kind.<ref name=Nargothrond>{{NM|P3}}, pp. 304-305</ref> They were the first to cross the [[Ered Luin]] in the [[First Age]], and established strongholds in [[Beleriand]] before the [[Elves]] arrived, at [[Nulukkizdîn]] and [[Sharbhund]] (also known as ''Bar-en-Nibin-noeg'', the \"House of the Petty Dwarves\"). In Beleriand they diminished in physical stature and in smith-craft.<ref name=\"Turambar1\">{{S|21}}</ref>\n[[File:Steamey - Hunting.jpg|thumb|left|''Hunting'' by Steamey]]\nThe [[Sindar]], not acquainted with Dwarves yet, thought the Petty-dwarves were animals, and hunted them. Not until the Dwarves of [[Belegost]] and [[Nogrod]] established contact with the Sindar did they realize what the \"animals\" were and named them ''Noegyth Nibin''; Petty-dwarves.<ref name=Quendi>{{WJ|AB}}, pp. 388-389</ref>\n\nWhen [[Finrod]] decided to build his realm in their old dwellings, he first received their help. Pretending friendship with him, they helped him in the building of [[Nargothrond]] in exchange of a generous reward. But their chieftain [[Mîm]] tried to kill Finrod in his sleep and they were expelled.<ref name=Nargothrond/>\n\nThereafter they were mostly left alone, but they had already dwindled and hated all [[Elves]] with a passion; especially the [[Noldor]] whom they saw as usurpers who took their lands ([[Nargothrond]] was built in Nulukkizdîn).<ref name=\"Turambar1\"/> In the time of the [[Wars of Beleriand]] the Petty-dwarves had nearly died out. The last remnant of their people were [[Mîm]] and his two sons [[Ibun]] and [[Khîm]], who lived at [[Amon Rûdh]].<ref name=\"Turambar1\"/>\n\n==Other names==\nWhen the Sindar still belived they were mere animals, the name for the Petty-dwarves was '''''Levain tad-[[tal|dail]]''''' (\"Two-legged Animals\"), or simply ''Tad-dail''.<ref name=Quendi/> Later they were given other names in [[Sindarin]]: '''''Nibin-Nogrim''''', collective name of sing.
