In amazement and disbelief, he finds himself looking at [[Gandalf]].<ref group=note>This is the first time Frodo sees Gandalf since the wizard [[The Bridge of Khazad-dûm (scene)|fell]] at the [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm]].</ref> The wizard and the hobbit both laugh joyfully, and [[Merry]] and [[Pippin]] rush in to the room and jump on Frodo's bed to hug him, thrilled to see him awake. [[Gimli]], [[Legolas]], and [[Aragorn]] join Frodo, reuniting the remaining members of the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]]. \n\nLast of all, [[Sam]] enters, standing in the doorway. As Frodo sees him, the two hobbits share a long, meaningful look, and simply smile at each other.\n\n==Differences==\nThe events in this scene correspond to parts of the chapter [[The Field of Cormallen]]. In the books, the events are told from the point-of-view of Sam, who wakes up in a bed in [[Ithilien]] next to Frodo, with Gandalf watching over them. He had been asleep and awoke on \"the [[8 April|eighth day of April]] in the [[Shire-reckoning]]\", according to Gandalf. The two hobbits are reunited with the rest of the surviving members of the Fellowship in the woods, where Aragorn bows before them and praises them<ref>{{RK|Cormallen}}, pp. 951-5</ref> (much like he does in the following scene, [[The Return of the King (scene)|The Return of the King]]).\n\n{{references|notes}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King scenes|73]]"}}}
