It had three minor tributaries: [[Glithui]], [[Malduin]]<ref>{{CH|Map}}</ref> and [[Celebros]].<ref>{{CH|17}}</ref>\n\nIn its pass by the southeast of Brethil, it descended through the [[Ravines of Taeglin]] that skirted the eaves of the Forest. Further south, the river could be forded at the [[Crossings of the Taeglin]], near the western border of Brethil. A road ran through it from [[Nargothrond]] to [[Minas Tirith (Beleriand)|Minas Tirith]].\n==Etymology==\nThe element ''[[taeg]]'' means \"boundary\".<ref name=\"WJ\">{{WJ|Hurin}}, pp. 309-10</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Etymologies]]'' the name appears in its earlier form \"Taiglin\" and its second element appears to be ''[[lin]]'' \"pool\".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry LIN(1)</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn earlier writings, the river was called '''Teiglin'''. As revealed in the ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' series, the name of the river should actually have been spelt ''Taeglin'' (\"Boundary River\").<ref name=\"WJ\"/> This was a relatively late change which was not adopted into the published ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', which uses the old name, as does ''[[The Children of Húrin]]''.\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Rivers of Beleriand]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n\n[[de:Teiglin]]\n[[fi:Teiglin]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/eaux/beleriand/teiglin]]"}}}
