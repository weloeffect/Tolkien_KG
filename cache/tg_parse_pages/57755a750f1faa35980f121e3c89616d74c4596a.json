The music was written by [[Maury Laws]]. It is the fourth track of the [[1977]] [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|film adaptation]] of ''[[The Hobbit]]''. The song was reprised in the [[1980]] follow-up, [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'']], where it was given a new lyric by [[Jules Bass]], and its melody also used for another song in the film called \"[[It's So Easy Not to Try]]\" (for which Bass also wrote the lyric).\n\n==Lyrics==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nRoads go ever, ever on, \nOver rock and under tree,\nBy caves where never [[sun]] has shown,\nBy streams that never find the sea.\n\nRoads go ever, ever on,\nUnder cloud and under [[Stars|star]],\nYet feet that wandering have gone\nWill turn at last to home afar.\nOver snow by winter sown,\nAnd through the merry flowers of June,\nOver grass and over stone,\nUnder the mountains in [[Moon|the moon]].\n\nRoads go ever, ever on, \nOver rock and under tree,\nBy caves where never sun has shown,\nBy streams that never find the sea.\n</poem>\n{{title}}\n[[Category:The Hobbit (1977 film) soundtrack]]"}}}
