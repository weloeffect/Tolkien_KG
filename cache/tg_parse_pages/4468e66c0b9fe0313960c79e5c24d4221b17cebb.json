Founded around {{SA|100}}, it was unique in the region for its republican government and its mixed population of Kirani Men and Elves.<ref name=koronande>{{ICE|2500}}, p. 16</ref><ref name=\"history\">{{ICE|2500}}, pp. 11-12</ref>\n\nKoronandë was the primary commercial power of the Mûmakan. To protect its merchant interests, the republic maintained a powerful navy. It was the only maritime force in the region capable of contesting the navy of neighbouring [[Tantûrak]].<ref name=koronande/>\n\nThe republic was governed by a senate of twelve members, each of its six districts electing two representatives. Political posts were generally held by Kirani, while Elves preferred to advise rather than bother with complicated politics. <ref name=koronande/>\n\n== History ==\nDuring the middle of the Second Age, Koronandë's status as the primary commercial hub of the Mûmakan was challenged by the rapid expansion of the neighbouring colony of Tantûrak. As the imperialist policies of [[Tar-Ciryatan]] intensified, maritime traffic shifted from Korlan to its port of Sarûl, and the appearance of warships in the Bay of Ûsakan sparked fears that the republic would soon be conquered. \n\nIn {{SA|1977}}, this anxiety facilitated a coup in which the senate was dissolved. A governor and merchant, [[Fourth of the Nazgûl|Jí Indûr]], centralized the government to address the Númenórean threat more effectively, though supported by an advisory council of oligarchs. By {{SA|1978}}, the republic was formally reorganized into a kingdom, with the \"King of Korlan\" ruling over a centralized state. This radical transition plunged the region into twenty-three years of civil rebellion. The monarchy ultimately collapsed shortly after {{SA|2000}}. During a public rally intended to mobilize the populace against the threat of the Magician in Tantûrak, Korlan's governor Loran Klien successfully appealed to the crowd for a return to traditional republican rule. The resulting riots drove king into exile and restored the Republic.\n\nTantûrak declared war on Koronandë in {{TA|1365}}, and during the seven years of conflict, the republic came close to losing. It was only through the intervention of the Mûmakani emperor Jí Amaav III, in truth their now-immortal former king, that a treaty was brokered in {{TA|1372}}. Koronandë was saved, but came under the influence of the empire that had saved it.<ref name=\"Nazgul\">{{ICE|8003}}, pp. 89-90</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe capital of the republic was Korlan, a major centre of commerce located at the mouth of the Koros River.\n\nWhile the Kirani dominated the cities, the Elves inhabited the more rural, forested areas of the country, often building their homes high in the trees.<ref name=koronande/>\n\n===Tauronde===\nThe most significant Elven settlement was Tauronde, a city presiding over a district of the same name located north and west of Korlan. Unlike the rest of the republic, Tauronde was almost entirely Elven in population, and both its governor and senate representatives were thus Elves.\n\nThe city was built into a cluster of Lurak trees, which grew to heights exceeding 200 feet.<ref name=koronande/>\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Middle-earth Role Playing locations]]"}}}
