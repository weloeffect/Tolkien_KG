It ran for seven series, between [[2002]] and [[2007]].\n\n==Series 3==\nIn Episode 1, the use of [[Bigatures]] by [[Weta Workshop]] for ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings Trilogy]]'' was referenced in a sketch wherein [[wikipedia:Tony Blair|Tony Blair]] claimed the [[wikipedia:Iraq War|Iraq War]] was all faked with the use of models; Blair asks [[wikipedia:Kirsty Wark|Kirsty Wark]], \"''I take it you've seen ''The Lord of the Rings''?''\" to which she replies, \"''No, I fear [[dwarves]].''\". Also, the show parodied [[wikipedia:How Clean Is Your House?|How Clean Is Your House?]] with [[wikipedia:Aggie MacKenzie|Aggie MacKenzie]] calling herself \"''the [[Gollum]] of grime''\" and the owner's house being described as \"''a cross between [[Mordor]] and Afghanistan''\".<ref name=\"S3E1\">''[[wikipedia:Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]'', Series 3, Episode 1 (see 3:26 - 4:56 and 17:00 - 18:13).

They are employed by [[Gandalf]] to rebuild [[The Shire]] following the [[Scouring of the Shire]], but - in common with all series of Auf Wiedersehen, Pet -  a nasty foreman turns up ([[Saruman]]) and one of the team falls in love with a local (an [[orcs|orc]]) who is then taught to speak [[wikipedia:Geordie|Geordie]].<ref name=\"S3E3\">''[[wikipedia:Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]'', Series 3, Episode 3 (see 16:30 - 18:16).

Yes, all of the extra endings to ''Return of the King'' that they couldn't fit in the film.''\" [[Gandalf]] suggests they could catch a later boat - which [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] suggests will come \"''about 9''\" -  and that in the meantime they could play [[wikipedia:Scrabble|Scrabble]]. \"''We know how disappointed you were that the cinema release of ''The Return of King'' had only 23 final scenes, now experience the DVD director's cut with all 98 endings.''\" Every time [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and Gandalf are about to leave, they have a reason to come back: Gandalf tells [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] that [http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_V:_The_Empire_Strikes_Back he is Merry's father]; they have a custard-pie fight; they destroyed the [http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Death_Star Death Star]. As they are about to leave (now with Merry, [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] reading newspapers in a bored manner), [[wikipedia:Jaws (film)|a shark arrives]]. \"''You can relive the cinematic experience of starting to leave because you think the film has finished, only having to sit back down again and again... this time from the comfort of your own home.

Bilbo refuses, saying that he wants to go home and the [[elves]] dislike him; acting like an obstinate - and paranoid - elderly man, refusing to go into care, he insists, \"''I'm not getting on any boat! ...
