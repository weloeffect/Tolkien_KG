Tolkien]], enclosed by him in a [[Letter to Eileen Elgar (5 March 1964)|1964 letter to Eileen Elgar]] (together with [[Kinship of the Half-elven]]).\n\nThe manuscript, consisting of nine pages, gives an outline of '[[The Silmarillion]]' by relating his poem ''[[The Hoard]]'' to this still unpublished work. An extract from the manuscript appeared in ''[[Sotheby's English Literature and English History 6-7 December 1984]]'', and was reproduced in [[Beyond Bree May 1985|''Beyond Bree'' May 1985]].<ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 617</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.tolkienbooks.net/php/details.php?reference=65820|articlename=Beyond Bree.

Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] have commented that:\n\n{{blockquote|Christina examined the manuscript on one of the pre-auction viewing days at [[Sotheby's]], and found that it gives some indication of Tolkien's then-current thoughts on some parts of ''The Silmarillion''. She had just read ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two|The Book of Lost Tales, Part Two]]'' (published 16 August 1984) and had reviewed it for ''[[Beyond Bree]]'', so that text was fresh in her mind; and in relation to it, she noted developments by Tolkien since the ''Lost Tales'' as well as differences from the published ''Silmarillion''. With regard to the [[ruin of Doriath]], the story told in the 1964 manuscript is closer to the ''[[Quenta Noldorinwa]]'' (not published until 1986) than to ''[[The Nauglafring]]'' in ''The Book of Lost Tales'', but differs in some respects from any published version — for instance, before beginning work on the treasure, the dwarves agree to accept a payment of a tenth of the unwrought metals. [[Thingol]], however, is still killed outside [[Menegroth]], with Tolkien giving two possible reasons why the dwarves were able to pass the [[Girdle of Melian]].<br>\n\n<br>''Presumably Tolkien made no file copy of this manuscript, and otherwise left no record in his papers to assist [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]] in his work on ''The Silmarillion''. A few years ago, Christina sent Christopher a copy of the notes she made at Sotheby's ..., which he found very interesting. The manuscript and covering letter sold for £2,000 to [[Charles James Sawyer Limited.|'Sawyer']], presumably a bookseller acting for a buyer, and we have seen no sign of it in later years, in public or private collections or in the marketplace.''<ref name=Plaza/><ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://www.grolierclub.org/default.aspx?p=v35ListDocument&ID=756962237&listid=11461&listitemid=150401&ssid=322536&dpageid=&listname=|articlename=Guide to the Charles J.

But after the disaster, when [[Morgoth]] contrived to destroy the [[Two Trees of Valinor]] (which illuminated that land) they acquired a special value — since Feänor had imprisoned in them the light of the Trees before Morgoth poisoned them.
