[[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] opened the box [[Galadriel]] had given him<ref>{{FR|Farewell}}</ref> and found a small silver seed, which he planted. In the [[Party Field]], a [[Mallorn]] sprang up to replace the old tree that had been cut down. Many children were born that year. [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] became heroes in the Shire, but [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] quietly retired. That spring, Sam married [[Rose Cotton]], [[Tolman Cotton Senior|Farmer Cotton]]'s daughter, and they lived at [[Bag End]] with Frodo.\n\nFrodo decided to travel to [[Rivendell]] to see [[Bilbo Baggins]]. Frodo entrusted to Sam a history of the War, written in part by Bilbo. Frodo, Sam, and others set out. As they entered the [[Woody End]], they met [[Elrond]] and [[Galadriel]], who now wore two of the [[Three Rings|Three Elven Rings]]. Riding slowly behind the two elves was Bilbo himself. Sam and Frodo accompanied the travellers to the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]]. When they reached the gates of the [[Grey Havens]], they found [[Gandalf]], wearing the [[Narya|last]] of the Three Rings, waiting for them. Beyond him was a great white ship, ready to sail to the West across the sea.\n\nPippin and Merry appeared, wishing to be present at Frodo's departure. Frodo sadly bade farewell to his three friends, kissed them, and boarded the ship. Gandalf entreated the three hobbits to enjoy each other's friendship as they quietly returned to the Shire. Sam entered his warm home, where he found [[Rosie Cotton|Rosie]] waiting. She put their young daughter, [[Elanor Gardner|Elanor]], in his lap, and Sam drew a deep breath and said, \"Well, I'm back.\"\n{{references}}\n[[Category:The Return of the King chapters|Grey Havens]]"}}}
