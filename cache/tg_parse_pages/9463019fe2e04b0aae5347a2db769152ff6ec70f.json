Tolkien]]'s [[legendarium]], compiled and edited by his son, [[Christopher Tolkien]].\n\nThe series shows the development over time of Tolkien's conception of [[Middle-earth]] as a fictional place with its own peoples, languages, and history, from his earliest notions of a \"mythology for England\" through to the development of the stories that make up ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. \n\nVolumes 6-9 have been published independently as a boxed set, by HarperCollins in [[1998]] and [[2002]], as ''[[The History of The Lord of the Rings]]''. In this set, ''[[Sauron Defeated]]'' retained only content related to ''The Lord of the Rings'', and was published under the title ''[[The End of the Third Age]]''.\n\n==Volumes and contents==\n* I. ''[[The Book of Lost Tales: Part One]]'' - (1983)\n\n* II. ''[[The Book of Lost Tales: Part Two]]'' - (1984)\n\n* III. ''[[The Lays of Beleriand]]'' - (1985)\n\n* IV. ''[[The Shaping of Middle-earth]]'' - (1986)\n\n* V. ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]'' - (1987)\n\n* VI. ''[[The Return of the Shadow]]'' - (1988)\n\n* VII. ''[[The Treason of Isengard]]'' - (1989)\n\n* VIII. ''[[The War of the Ring]]'' - (1990)\n\n* IX. ''[[Sauron Defeated]]'' - (1992)\n\n* X. ''[[Morgoth's Ring]]'' - (1993)\n\n* XI. ''[[The War of the Jewels]]'' - (1994)\n\n* XII. ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'' - (1996)\n\n* ''[[The History of Middle-earth Index|Index]]'' - (2002)\n\nThe first two books introduce us to ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', the first conception of Tolkien's [[legendarium]]. The third volume deals with long poems concerning some of the main stories. The following two books follow developments from ''The Book of Lost Tales'' to the first so called ''Quenta Silmarillion''. Volumes 6 through 9 discuss the development of ''The Lord of the Rings'', while the second half of book 9 discusses the tale of Númenor. Books 10 and 11 discuss the later developments of ''The Silmarillion'', which served as source material for ''[[The Silmarillion|the published edition]]''. The final book entails the development of [[The Lord of the Rings Appendices|''The Lord of the Rings'' Appendices]], followed by some assorted essays J.R.R. Tolkien wrote in the last years of his life.\n\nA thirteenth volume was published in 2002, ''[[The History of Middle-earth Index]]''. This book has completely integrated all the indices from the set in one large index.\n\n==Conception==\nAfter the publishing his edition of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' in [[1977]], Christopher Tolkien continued investigating the earlier manuscripts of his father, preparing a book which he called ''The History of The Silmarillion''. In [[1981]], he wrote to [[Rayner Unwin]] (then chairman of [[Allen and Unwin]]), informing him of the work acomplished till that point: a book of 1,968 pages so far, 16,5 inches across.<ref>{{BL|Preface}}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|If and/or when you see this book, you will perceive immediately why I have said that it is in no conceivable way publishable. The textual and other discussions are far too detailed and minute; the size of it is (and will become progressively more so) prohibitive. It is done partly for my own satisfaction in getting things right, and because I wanted to know how the whole conception did in reality evolve from the earliest origins...\n\nIf there is a future for such enquiries, I want to make as sure as I can that any later research into JRRT's \"literary history\" is not turned into a nonsense by mistaking the actual course of its evolution. The chaos and intrinsic difficulty of many of the papers (the layer upon layer of changes in a single manuscript page, the vital clues on scattered scraps found anywhere in the archive, the texts written on the backs of other works, the disordering and separation of manuscripts, the near or total illegibility in places, is simply inexaggerable...\n\nIn theory, I could produce a lot of books out of the History, and there are many possibilities and combinations of possibilities. For example, I could do \"[[Beren]]\", with the [[The Tale of Tinúviel|original Lost Tale]], ''[[The Lay of Leithian]]'', and an essay on the development of the legend. My preference, if it came to anything so positive, would probably be for the treating of one legend as a developing entity, rather than to give all the Lost Tales at one go; but the difficulties of exposition in detail would in such a case be great, because one would have to explain so often what was happening elsewhere, in other unpublished writings.}}\n\n==Publication history and gallery==\n:''Here gives the publication history of the three-volume set.
