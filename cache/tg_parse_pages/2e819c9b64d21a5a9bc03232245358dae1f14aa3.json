This scene was not featured in the theatrical release of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe [[Riders of Rohan]] come upon the bodies of men of Rohan and horses at the [[Fords of Isen]]. Éomer instructs them to search for [[Théodred]], the son of King [[Théoden]]. He recognises the [[White Hand]] of [[Saruman]] painted on the armour of the orcs. They find Théodred badly wounded, but alive, and bring him to [[Edoras]]. \n\n==Differences==\nIt is told in [[Unfinished Tales]] that Théodred was found near the brink of death by [[Elfhelm]] and [[Grimbold]] rather than Éomer as happens in this scene. However, Théodred died at the Fords of Isen after asking the two men to \"Keep the Fords until Éomer comes\".<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers scenes|07]]"}}}
