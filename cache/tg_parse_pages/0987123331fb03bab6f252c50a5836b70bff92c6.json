It is probable that ''loss'' referred to the blossoms of the fruit trees. The words for flower, ''[[loth]]'', and for snow, ''loss'' are very similar in Sindarin.<ref name=VT18/> The [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] settlers, mariners, soldiers and other emigrants, who gave names to the places in Gondor in the [[Second Age]],  did not know Sindarin well.<ref name=VT17/> As a consequence, it is possible that they confused the Sindarin word for flowers with the Sindarin word for snow.\n\n==Inspiration==\n[[Letter to Jennifer Brookes-Smith (28 July 1955)|Writing in a letter]] about an impending trip in [[1955]], [[J.R.R.

It was across the river [[Erui]] from Upper [[Lebennin]] to the west and across the river [[Anduin]] from South [[Ithilien]] to the east. The [[Rammas Echor]] divided it from the [[Pelennor Fields|Pelennor]] to the north-east. Settlements in Lossarnach included the capital city of Arnach, [[Imloth Melui]], [[Harlond (Gondor)|Harlond]], and \"Ost Norhir\", though the latter two have fallen to the [[Minas Morgul|Morgul]]-host. The emblem of Lossarnach was three red roses on a white field. Baranor, Captain of the Guard of Arnach, and the Lady Vanyalos, sister of [[Denethor]] and wife of [[Forlong]], were in charge of the land when Forlong went to [[Minas Tirith]].\n\n{{references|n}}\n[[Category:Mannish names]]\n[[Category:Regions of Gondor]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]"}}}
