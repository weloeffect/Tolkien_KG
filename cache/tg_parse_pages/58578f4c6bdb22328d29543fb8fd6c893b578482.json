Tolkien - Beren Gamlost heraldic device.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Beren Gamlost's heraldic device by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]\nBeren was the son of [[Barahir]] and [[Emeldir]] and was named after [[Beren (son of Belemir)|Beren, his maternal grandfather]].<ref>{{WJ|West}}</ref> He was a Man of the royal [[House of Bëor]] of [[Dorthonion]] for his father was most likely the last Chieftain of the House of Bëor. The [[Dagor Bragollach]] (\"Battle of Sudden Flame\") befell during his youth, bringing about the ruin of his land. The young Beren lived with his father and ten loyal followers in the highlands of Dorthonion, and the twelve of them performed many acts of bravery, to the great frustration of [[Morgoth]], the Dark Lord of [[Angband]]. But due to the treachery of [[Gorlim the Unhappy]], Barahir's [[Barahir's outlaws|outlaws]] in [[Dorthonion]] were slain at the hands of the [[Orcs]] of [[Sauron]]. Beren swore an oath to avenge his father. But he \"wept not, for his heart was ice\".<ref>{{LB|C2}}</ref> He slew the orcs responsible for the death of his people and recovered from them the [[Ring of Barahir]].<ref name=\"S19\" />\n\nLiving as an outlaw, his daring feats won renown throughout the free world, and earned the hatred of Morgoth, who set upon his head a bounty. Thus, he was forced to abandon the land of his birth and the grave of his father. He passed through the horrors of [[Nan Dungortheb]] by paths traversed by no other elves or men, and came into [[Doriath]], where he met and fell in love with Lúthien — princess of the [[Sindar]], and daughter of [[Thingol]], King of Doriath and [[Melian]] the [[Maia]] — upon seeing her dancing in the woods of [[Neldoreth]], and she loved him too.<ref name=\"S19\" />\n\n===Quest for the Silmaril===\n[[File:Peter Xavier Price - Beren leaves Menegroth.jpg|thumb|left|''Beren leaves Menegroth'' by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]]\n{{Main|Quest for the Silmaril}}\nThingol refused to give Lúthien's hand in marriage, as Beren was a mortal. He charged Beren that he would allow the marriage to take place only if he brought back a [[Silmaril]] from the [[Iron Crown]] of Morgoth. The task was intended to be impossible, but Beren was determined. He set out on his quest with the aid of [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] of [[Nargothrond]], but was soon captured by [[Sauron]] and imprisoned in [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]]. There Finrod succumbed to death, at the hands of the wolves of Sauron, saving the life of Beren with his dying act. Lúthien, along with [[Huan]] the great hound, eventually came to his rescue, and they departed that place. Near to [[Brethil]], they were ambushed by two of the [[Sons of Fëanor]], [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]], the latter of whom had swept Lúthien up into his saddle. To rescue her, Beren carried out his [[Leap of Beren|leap of renown]] to the steed of Curufin. Stripping him of his horse and knife, [[Angrist]], Beren bade the two brothers be gone. Curufin fired arrows at Lúthien as they fled, and Beren was hit. He was nursed back to health by Lúthien and Huan.<ref name=\"S19\" />\n\n[[Image:Ted_Nasmith_-_Transformed.jpg|thumb|''Transformed'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nAfter a time, Beren continued upon his quest. Leaving Lúthien in the care of Huan, he travelled to the borders of [[Anfauglith]] and despairing, there sung the [[Song of Parting]]. Unlooked for, Lúthien and Huan heard his lament and came to him, and Beren tried to dissuade her from joining his quest, but then Huan spoke, counselling that their fates were now entwined. Then, disguising themselves as fell servants of Sauron, they crossed leagues of desert, ashes and dust until they came to the [[Gates of Angband]].<ref name=\"S19\" />\n\nUsing Lúthien's powers to place Morgoth's court into a deep sleep, they were able to enter Angband where Beren cut a Silmaril from the [[Iron Crown]] of Morgoth. However, as they escaped from Angband, the great wolf [[Carcharoth]], whom Morgoth had personally bred, awoke. Beren held out the Silmaril, hoping that its radiance would avert the beast, but he was mistaken. Carcharoth bit off his hand, swallowing it along with the Silmaril, and proceeded to run rampant through Doriath. Thus Beren was called '''''Erchamion''''', \"One-handed\". Lúthien and the unconscious Beren were rescued by the Eagles of [[Manwë]]. Coming back to Thingol's court, both told him the tale of their quest and how Beren had fulfilled Thingol's demand, as he had one Silmaril in his hand. Thus, Thingol relented, and Beren and Lúthien were married; this was the first [[Unions of Elves and Men|union of Elves and Men]].\nBeren participated in the hunting of Carcharoth, where the beast was slain and the Silmaril recovered; the quest was accomplished, but in the process Huan was slain and Beren was mortally wounded.<ref name=\"S19\" />\n\nSuccumbing to grief over the death of her beloved, Lúthien died, and her soul fled to the [[Halls of Mandos]], where she moved [[Mandos]] to pity. So it came to pass that Lúthien and Beren were granted a life together in [[Middle-earth]].<ref name=\"S19\" /> Both she and Beren were restored to life, but both of them would die the mortal death of Men, and go beyond the walls of [[Arda]] to the  unknown [[Doom of Men]].<ref name=\"doriath\">{{S|Doriath}}</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\n{{Quote|(...) and whether the second span of his life was brief or long is not known to Elves or Men|''The Lost Road and Other Writings'', \"VI. Quenta Silmarillion\"}}\nThus Beren and Lúthien lived again, and dwelt on [[Tol Galen]] in the middle of the [[Adurant|River Adurant]] in [[Ossiriand]]. There they stayed apart from other mortals. Lúthien bore Beren a son, named [[Dior]], Thingol's heir.<ref name=\"S20\" /> He was considered to be one of the fairest beings to ever live, for in him flowed the blood of Men, the blood of Elves, and the blood of the [[Ainur]]. Through his descendants, the blood of Beren and of Lúthien was preserved among the [[Eldar]] and the [[Edain]].\n[[File:Turner Mohan - Beren and Luthien.jpg|thumb|''Beren and Luthien'' by [[:Category:Images by Turner Mohan|Turner Mohan]]]]\n\nThe taking of the Silmaril from Angband by Beren and Lúthien led [[Maedhros]], the eldest of the [[sons of Fëanor]] to lead a [[Union of Maedhros|union]] of Elves and Men in an assault upon Angband in the ill-fated [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]. It was here that Morgoth gained a greater control over Beleriand and where [[Húrin]] of the [[House of Hador]] was taken prisoner to Angband.<ref name=\"S20\">{{S|20}}</ref>\n\nBeren was involved with the events of the [[First Age]] only one further time. After the murder of Thingol, [[Mablung]] was sent by Melian to warn Beren. He gathered the [[Green-elves]], and with the aid of some [[Ents]]<ref>{{L|248}}</ref> they waylaid a group of the [[Dwarves of Nogrod]] who had [[battle in the Thousand Caves|destroyed]] Doriath and stolen its treasures. They ambushed the Dwarves and vanquished them in the [[Battle of Sarn Athrad]]. Because the [[Naugladur|Lord of Nogrod]] cursed the treasure, Beren threw it in the river [[Ascar]], but salvaged the [[Nauglamir]] which he brought to his wife. Their son Dior left to restore and rule [[Menegroth]].<ref name=\"doriath\" />\n\nBeren and Lúthien died together on Tol Galen. Among the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] the final death of Beren and Lúthien is accounted in {{FA|503}}, for in the Autumn of that year Dior received the Silmaril in Doriath, and it was taken as a sign of his parents' death.

In this version, Beren was an Elf: one of the [[Gnomes]] of [[Dor-lómin]], the son of [[Egnor bo-Rimion]] the Forester.<ref name=\"LT2 Tinuviel p.11\">{{LT2|In}}, p. 11</ref> \n\nHe arrived in [[Artanor]] (an early form of Doriath) and saw Tinúviel (the early name of Lúthien) as in the later work, although the backstory regarding the outlaws of Barahir is absent in the early tale. The displeasure of King [[Tinwelint]] against him was because the [[Dark Elves]] of [[Artanor]] considered those Elves treacherous.<ref>{{BL|Introduction}}</ref> After being sent to obtain a Silmaril by Tinwelint, Beren heads directly to [[Angamandi]], and is captured by orcs and brought before [[Melko]]<ref name=\"LT2 Tinuviel pp.14-5\">{{LT2|In}}, pp. 14-5</ref> rather than going to seek the aid of King Finrod Felagund. Throughout this early tale, the entire \"Nargothrond element\" is absent.<ref name=\"LT2 Tinuviel p.53\">{{LT2|In}}, p. 53</ref> Instead of being imprisoned in Tol-in-Gaurhoth by Sauron, Beren is put to work as a scullion in the kitchens of [[Tevildo]], Prince of Cats, a very early narrative forerunner to Sauron.<ref name=\"LT2 Tinuviel p.54\">{{LT2|In}}, p. 54</ref> Upon his rescue from the castle of Tevildo by Tinúviel, he emerged with a kitchen knife<ref name=\"LT2 Tinuviel p.29\">{{LT2|In}}, p. 29</ref> which he later used to cut a Silmaril from the Iron Crown of Melko.<ref name=\"LT2 Tinuviel p.33\">{{LT2|In}}, p. 33</ref> This weapon is used in place of Angrist, since the encounter with Celegorm and Curufin is absent in this early tale. \n\nAfter obtaining the Silmaril, the jewel and the hand of Beren were bitten off by the wolf Karkaras (an early name for Carcharoth).<ref name=\"LT2 Tinuviel p.34\">{{LT2|In}}, p. 34</ref> Beren and Tinúviel then fled and were found by Huan, who brought them to Artanor.<ref name=\"LT2 Tinuviel pp.35-7\">{{LT2|In}}, pp. 35-7</ref> This contrasts with the rescue of Beren and Lúthien from the gates of Angband by Thorondor and the [[Eagles]] in the published version of [[The Silmarillion]]; Christopher Tolkien remarks that \"far more is made of the healing of Beren's wound\" in the final work.<ref name=\"LT2 Tinuviel p. 58\">{{LT2|In}}, p. 58</ref>\n\nThe death of Beren in the early tale follows a similar story arc, however Christopher Tolkien discusses the consequences of Beren's Elvish nature in the early tale here.<ref name=\"LT2 Tinuviel pp. 59-60\">{{LT2|In}}, pp. 59-60</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nThe story of Beren and Lúthien, though mentioned only briefly in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', was a central part of the [[Legendarium]]. Tolkien once referred to it as \"the kernel of the mythology\".<ref>{{L|165}}</ref> He went on to say that it \"arose from a small woodland glade filled with 'hemlocks'\", which he visited while serving in the Humber Garrison in 1918 (during [[World War I]]).\n\nTolkien seemed to be somehow connected to this character, and parallels can be drawn with his relationship with [[Edith Tolkien|Edith Bratt]]. Furthermore it is possible that ''Beren'' (meaning 'brave') is a reference to the original meaning of his Germanic surname (Toll kühn) of similar meaning. It is said that, like the story of Lúthien dancing in the woods before Beren, that one day while Tolkien and his wife were on a picnic in the woods she danced for him, thus creating another parallel to Beren and Luthien. \n\nTolkien was buried in [[Wolvercote Cemetery]] (North [[Oxford]]) and this name appears on the stone:\n\n:JOHN RONALD REUEL TOLKIEN Beren 1892 – 1973\n\nThe name of Lúthien also appears on the stone:\n\n:EDITH MARY TOLKIEN Lúthien 1889 – 1971\n\n\n\n[[John Garth]] has theorized that the name Beren could have originally come from Beren’s Hill in [[Wikipedia:South Oxfordshire|South Oxfordshire]].<ref name=\"VanityFair\">{{webcite|authorJohn Garth|articleurl=https://steadyhq.com/en/john-garth-on-tolkiens-life-and-works/posts/40c3274b-ffc1-4c1e-aba4-547f4d15bd6b?utm_campaign=steady_sharing_button|articlename=Where did Tolkien’s Silmarillion hero Beren get his name?|dated=22-March-2024|website=Steady|accessed=23-March-2024}}</ref>{{references}}\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n| name=Beren\n| race=edain\n| house=[[House of Bëor]]\n| born={{FA|432}}\n| died={{FA|466}}/{{FA|503|n}}\n}}\n{{seq\n| prow=\n| pvac=\n| prev=[[Barahir]]\n| list=8th Head of the [[House of Bëor]]\n| dates={{FA|460}} - {{FA|466|n}}\n| next=''House of Bëor ceased to exist''\n| nvac=None\n| nrow=\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n{{Outlaws}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:Edain]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Gnomish names]]\n[[Category:House of Bëor]]\n[[Category:Noldorin names]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n[[de:Beren Erchamion]]\n[[fr:encyclo:personnages:hommes:1a:peuple de beor:beren]]\n[[fi:Beren]]"}}}
