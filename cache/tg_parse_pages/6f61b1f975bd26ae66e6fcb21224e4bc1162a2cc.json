They are divided into two varieties: sand-drakes, animalistic beasts that can mimic the characteristics of objects they touch, and true were-worms, intelligent beings that use sorcery to take on the forms of other things.<ref>{{ICE|2012}}</ref>\n\n'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''\n:[[Azog]]'s forces use giant worms, which Azog calls \"earth eaters\", to tunnel underground towards the city of [[Dale]]. When the creatures appear during the [[Battle of Five Armies]], [[Gandalf]] identifies them as \"were-worms\". In the film, they are depicted as absolutely gigantic, with [[Weta Digital]] stating that they are 400 feet long and 75 feet in diameter. They are apparently used only for tunneling, not fighting, as they do not take part in the ensuing battle.  \n\n{{References}}\n{{Legend}}\n[[Category:Enigmas]]\n[[Category:Other races]]\n[[fi:Hirmukäärmeet (Viimeinen erämaa)]]"}}}
