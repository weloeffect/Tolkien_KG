Argon and his elder brothers also had only one sister, ''[[Aredhel]]'' (only daughter of Fingolfin and Anairë) who was elder to Argon.\n\nHis [[Quenya]] name was '''''Arakáno''''' (\"High Commander\"), named so partially for his impetuous character. Argon set foot on [[Middle-earth]] with his father and siblings, but he was killed during the [[Battle of the Lammoth]]. Argon distinguished himself during the fighting by hewing a path through his foes and slaying the captain of the [[Orcs]].<ref name=\"Shibboleth\"/><ref name=\"Note\">{{PM|XINotes}}, p. 362 (Note 38)</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Argon'' is the [[Sindarin]] form of '''''Arakáno''''', although he never used it. It was devised posthumously for him in the records. It is recorded that this later became a popular name of Argon which was used by the [[Eldar]].<ref name=\"Shibboleth\"/>\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| MIR |y| FIN |y| IND | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |FIN=[[Finwë]]<br /><small>''d. {{YT|1495}}''</small>|IND=[[Indis]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|MIR=[[Míriel]]<br /><small>''d. {{YT|1170}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | |!| | | |)|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | FEA | | FDS | | FNG |y| ANA | | IRM | | FIR | | |FEA=[[Fëanor]]<br /><small>''{{YT|1169}} - {{YT|1497|n}}''</small>|FDS=[[Findis]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|FNG=[[Fingolfin]]<br /><small>''{{YT|1190}} - {{FA|456}}''</small>|ANA=[[Anairë]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|IRM=[[Írimë]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|FIR=[[Finarfin]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT|1230}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| |,|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree| FIN | | TUR |y| ELE | | ARE |y| EOL | | ARG|FIN=[[Fingon]]<br /><small>''{{YT|1260}} - {{FA|472}}''</small>|ARE=[[Aredhel]]<br /><small>''{{YT|1362}} - {{FA|400}}''</small>|TUR=[[Turgon]]<br /><small>''{{YT|1300}} - {{FA|510}}''</small>|ELE=[[Elenwë]]<br /><small>''d. {{YT|1500}}''</small>|EOL=[[Eöl]]<br /><small>''d. {{FA|400}}''</small>|ARG='''ARGON'''<br /><small>''d. {{YT|1500}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | TUO |y| IDR | | | | | | MAE | | | | | ||MAE=[[Maeglin]]<br /><small>''{{FA|320}} - {{FA|510|n}}''</small>|IDR=[[Idril]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|TUO=[[Tuor]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA|472}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | | | EAR | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | ||EAR=[[Eärendil]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA|503}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nArgon does not appear in the published ''[[The Silmarillion|Silmarillion]]'' at all, as he only came to light in very late writings by [[J.R.R.
