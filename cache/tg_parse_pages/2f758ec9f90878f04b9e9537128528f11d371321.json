Half-elven are not a distinct race ''per se''; rather, they were fertile offspring as the result of a union between [[Elves]] and [[Men]]. There are four recorded unions of the [[Eldar]] with the [[Edain]]. \n\nIn the late [[First Age]], [[Lúthien]] married [[Beren]] and [[Idril]] married [[Tuor]].<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref><ref name=\"Gondolin\">{{S|Gondolin}}</ref> These two lines of Peredhil were then joined by the marriage of [[Eärendil]] and [[Elwing]]. Eärendil and Elwing were the first to receive the choice of fates which passed to their line. Their sons, [[Elros]] and [[Elrond]], chose different fates and the line was sundered until the end of the [[Third Age]].\n\nIn the end of the [[Third Age]], when [[Arwen|Arwen Undómiel]] wed [[Aragorn|Aragorn II Elessar]],<ref>{{RK|Steward}}</ref> a distant descendant of Elros Tar-Minyatur, it united the long-sundered lines of those descended from both Elves and Men.

Dior wed [[Nimloth of Doriath]], and they had three children: [[twins]] [[Eluréd]] and [[Elurín]], and [[Elwing|Elwing the White]]. Dior wore the [[Nauglamir]] with the [[Silmaril]], passed to him from his mother, thus awakening the oath of the [[Fëanorians]] and the [[Second Kinslaying]].\n\nThe next bond came about through the union of [[Tuor]] son of [[Huor]] and [[Idril Celebrindal]], from which another son, [[Eärendil]], was born. While Eärendil was truly half-elven, his Adan father, Tuor, had been granted the fate of the elder race.<ref name=\"Gondolin\" /> Eärendil and Elwing begat another pair of twin sons: [[Elrond]] and [[Elros]]. Of the half-elves, Eärendil and Elwing were specifically given a choice in their fates when they journeyed to Valinor with the Silmaril to beg pardon for the [[Noldor]] and plead the plight of Elves and Men to the Valar. Only after that event was the choice passed to their children, to be counted as one of the [[Eldar]] (Elves), thus being immortal, or one of the [[Edain]] (Men), thus being mortal.<ref name=\"Voyage\">{{S|Voyage}}</ref> Elrond Half-elven chose the fate of Elven-kind, but Elros chose the [[Gift of Men]], and none of [[House of Elros|his descendants]] bore the title of \"Half-Elven\".\n\n[[Image:Līga Kļaviņa - Family.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Līga Kļaviņa - ''Family'']]\nElrond wed [[Celebrían]], daughter of [[Celeborn]] and [[Galadriel]], and bore three children: twin sons [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]], and daughter [[Arwen Undómiel]]. Aragorn and Arwen were parents to a son, [[Eldarion]], as well as at least two daughters, thus leaving a remnant of the proud Elven lineage even after the Firstborn had long passed over the sea and out of time and memory. Though these children were long-lived, like Númenóreans had been and Eldarion ruled for at least 100 years,<ref>{{L|338}}</ref> they were mortal.   \n\nThere is no evidence that any other mixed bloodline shared in the choice of fate as Earendil's and Elwing's. The children of [[Mithrellas]], [[Galador]] and [[Gilmith]], were enobled but mortal like their father, as were their descendants.<ref name=\"Debate\" />\n\n===The half-elven lines===\nThose sharing a divine heritage and didn't make a choice are bold faced; those who chose to be counted as an Elda rather than an Adan are italicized; those who were counted among the Edain (or who had not made the choice either way) are not. Their actual mathematical descent from elves is in a fraction in parentheses.\n\nThe important members of the half-elven lines were:\n*'''[[Dior]]''', son of Man [[Beren]] and Elf [[Lúthien]], grandson of the [[Maia]] [[Melian]]. (1/4)\n:Dior and his descendants were not only half-elven, but also descendants of the divine bloodline of [[Melian]]; Dior was slain in his 30s, far below the lifespan of a mortal, therefore his intended nature, [[Elven life cycle|longevity]] and [[mortality]] are not known.\n*''[[Eärendil]]'', son of the Man [[Tuor]] and Elf [[Idril]] (1/2)\n:Eärendil would rather have chosen the kindred of Men, but he chose the Elves for his wife Elwing's sake (she also chose the Elves). His fate was special; although he was not allowed to stay in [[Valinor]] with the Elves, he had to sail the heavens in his ship [[Vingilótë]], wearing the [[Silmaril]] of Beren and Lúthien on his brow, [[Star of Earendil|shining brightly]] as a sign of hope for [[Middle-earth]].<ref name=\"Voyage\" />\n\n*''[[Elwing]]'', daughter of Dior and [[Nimloth of Doriath|Nimloth]]. (5/8)\n:Elwing's family was slain or lost, with only Elwing surviving, given her choice of kindred and choosing the Eldar. As Eärendil sailed the heavens, Elwing resided in a white tower built northward on the borders of the [[Sundering Seas]] and met him upon his return.<ref name=\"Voyage\" />\n\n*'''[[Eluréd]]''' and '''[[Elurín]]''', sons of Dior and Nimloth. (5/8)\n:While Dior was slain, Eluréd and Elurín were abandoned in the woods outside Doriath by the vengeful Noldor and were never found again, disappearing from history in a very young age.<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref> As with their father, their eventual nature remains unknown.\n*''[[Elrond]]'', son of Eärendil and Elwing. (9/16)\n:His heirs would also have the free choice of kindred.\n\n*[[Elros]], also son of Eärendil and Elwing. (9/16)\n:The heirs of Elros were not given the choice of the children of Elrond; but their lifespan was multiple of that of normal Men. In later times, the [[Kings of Númenor]] regretted their forefather's choice, and this led to the [[downfall of Númenor]].\n*[[Arwen]], daughter of Elrond and [[Celebrían]]. (25/32)\n:She could choose her kindred like her father; however unlike him, after living for millennia as an Elf, she ultimately chose the fate of Men and married [[Aragorn]], distant heir of Elros. Their son [[Eldarion]] and their daughters were not counted as Half-elven, but rather as [[Dúnedain]] restored, as the two Half-elven lines of Earendil were merged in the [[Fourth Age]].\n\n*'''[[Elladan]]''' and '''[[Elrohir]]''', sons of Elrond and Celebrían.  (25/32)\n:Like their sister they \"shall live with the youth of the Eldar\" as immortals; until they made their choice, which they were bound to make only after their father took the [[White Ship]] out from Middle-earth. Their choice(s) and fate(s) is unknown.<ref>{{App|A1v}}</ref>\n\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree|MEL|y|THI| | | |BEO| | | |HAD| | | | | |HAL| |FIN|y|IND|THI=[[Thingol]]|MEL=[[Melian]]|HAD=''[[House of Hador]]''|HAL=''[[House of Haleth]]''|BEO=''[[House of Bëor]]''|FIN=[[Finwë]]|IND=[[Indis]]\n|boxstyle=white-space:nowrap;\n}}\n{{familytree| | | |!| | | | | |F|~|A|~|7| | | |:| | | | | | | |:| | | |,|-|^|-|.|}}\n{{familytree| | | |!| | | | |BAR| |BLG| |GAL|~|~|y|~|~|HAR| |FIN| |FIA|y|EAR| |BAR=[[Barahir]]|BLG=[[Belegund]]|GAL=[[Galdor (Lord of Dor-lómin)|Galdor]]|HAR=[[Hareth]]|FIN=[[Fingolfin]]|FIA=[[Finarfin]]|EAR=[[Eärwen]]\n|boxstyle=white-space:nowrap;\n}}\n{{familytree| | | |!| | | | | |!| | | |!| | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | |!| | | | | |!|}}\n{{familytree| | |LUT|~|y|~|BRN| |RIA|~|~|y|~|~|HUO| | | | | |TUR|y|ELE|!| |TUR=[[Turgon]]|LUT=[[Lúthien]]|BRN=[[Beren]]|RIA=[[Rían]]|HUO=[[Huor]]|ELE=[[Elenwë]]\n|boxstyle=white-space:nowrap;\n}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | |!|}}\n{{familytree| | | | | |DIO|y|NIM| | | | |TUO|~|~|~|~|~|y|~|~|~|~|~|IDR| | |!|DIO=[[Dior]]|TUO=[[Tuor]]|IDR=[[Idril]]|NIM=[[Nimloth]]\n|boxstyle=white-space:nowrap;\n}}\n{{familytree| | | | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|.| | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | |!|}}\n{{familytree| | | |ELD| |ELN| |ELW|~|~|~|~|y|~|~|~|~|EAR| | | | |CEL|y|GAL| | | |ELD=[[Eluréd]]|ELN=[[Elurín]]|ELW=[[Elwing]]|EAR=[[Eärendil]]|GAL=[[Galadriel]]|CEL=[[Celeborn]]\n|boxstyle=white-space:nowrap;\n}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |,|-|-|-|^|-|-|-|.| | | | | | | | | | |!|}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | |ELO| | | | | |ELD|~|~|~|~|y|~|~|~|CEL|ELO=[[Elros]]|ELD=[[Elrond]]|CEL=[[Celebrían]]\n|boxstyle=white-space:nowrap;\n}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |:| | | | | | | | | | | | | |!|}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | |NUM| | | | | | | | | | | | |!|NUM=''[[Kings of Númenor]]''\n|boxstyle=white-space:nowrap;\n}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |:| | | | | | | | | | | | | |!|}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | |AND| | | | | | | | | | | | |!|AND=''[[Lords of Andúnië]]''\n|boxstyle=white-space:nowrap;\n}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |:| | | | | | | | | | | | | |!|}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | |ARR| | | | | | | | | | | | |!|ARR=''[[Kings of Arnor|High Kings of Arnor]]''\n|boxstyle=white-space:nowrap;\n}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |:| | | | | | | | | | | | | |!|}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | |ART| | | | | | | | | | | | |!|ART=''[[Kings of Arthedain]]''\n|boxstyle=white-space:nowrap;\n}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |:| | | | | | | | | | | | | |!|}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | |CDN| | | | | | | | | | | | |!|CDN=''[[Chieftains of the Dúnedain]]''\n|boxstyle=white-space:nowrap;\n}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |:| | | | | | | | | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|.|}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | |ARA|~|~|~|y|~|~|~|ARW| |ELL| |ELR| | |ARA=[[Aragorn]]|ARW=[[Arwen]]|ELL=[[Elladan]]|ELR=[[Elrohir]]\n|boxstyle=white-space:nowrap;\n}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |,|-|^|-|.|}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |ELD| |DAU|ELD=[[Eldarion]]|DAU=Many daughters\n|boxstyle=white-space:nowrap;\n}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn an older version of the ''Quenta Silmarillion'', Manwë spoke this judgment to Eärendil: \n\n{{quote|To Eärendel I remit the ban, and the peril that he took upon himself out of love for the Two Kindreds shall not fall on him; neither shall it fall upon Elwing who entered into peril for love of Eärendel: save only in this: they shall not ever walk again among Elves or Men in the Outer Lands.
