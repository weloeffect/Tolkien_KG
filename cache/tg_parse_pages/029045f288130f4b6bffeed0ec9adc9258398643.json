The [[Sun]] that gave it light was larger then the Earth's sun, though it was dimmer and the [[Stars]] were faint and arranged in a strange way. A little later on, Ramer suggested that this could be because what he thought was air may actually have been water or another liquid and he \"''may have been on the floor of a wide shallow sea''\". While he could not be sure, he suspected that Tekel-Mirim was in a solar system that was perhaps within a nebula much larger than one in [[Wikipedia:Andromeda|Andromeda]].<ref name=\"Tekel\"/>\n\nThe planet of Tekel-Mirim itself was a land of crystals. Of which, Ramer likened the greatest among them to the Egyptian pyramids. However, he was unable to judge the exact size, believing this to be due to not having his body to contrast with. According to Ramer, it was the inanimate matter that grew into the countless crystalline formations varying in complexity.<ref name=\"Tekel\"/>\n\nAs time passed in contemplation, Ramer noticed these forms also suffered a beautiful process of disintegration, although there were some basic structures that remained. On one occasion when he was visiting this planet, he had the urge to come back to his body, but while doing so, he was distracted by a sphere, which took him to a scene completely different of Tekel-Mirim.<ref name=\"Tekel\"/>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nIn an earlier draft that [[Christopher Tolkien]] referred to as ''A'', The original name of the planet was '''Tekel-Ishtar''' before it was changed to the name ''Tekel-Mirim'' within the final version.<ref>{{SD|2cn}}, note 67</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [https://www.steelpillow.com/blocki/culture/tolkien.html Tekel-Mirim – Tolkien's Polyhedra]\n\n{{References}}\n{{LegendLoc}}\n[[Category:Cosmology]]\n[[Category:The Notion Club Papers]]"}}}
