She was said to be the fairest maiden amongst all the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] to have ever lived, a beauty that would appear again only millennia later on [[Arwen]]. She wedded [[Beren]], a [[Men|Man]], with whom she shared the fate of [[mortality]]. \n\n==History==\n[[File:Alice Falto - Birth of Luthien.jpg|thumb|left|''Birth of Luthien'' by [[:Category:Images by Alice Falto|Alice Falto]]]]\nLúthien was born during the [[Years of the Trees]] of the [[First Age]], at the end of the first age of the [[Chaining of Melkor]]. She was born in the [[Forest of Neldoreth]] under the [[stars]], and [[niphredil]] first grew at the moment of her birth.<ref>{{GA|17}}</ref>\n\nShe would often [[Ir Ithil ammen Eruchín|sing]]<ref>{{LB|Song}}, lines 99-103</ref> and dance in the woods, while her friend [[Daeron]], the minstrel of Thingol, would play his flute. Daeron came to love her, and while she enjoyed his company, she did not return his love.<ref name=\"Beren\">{{S|Beren}}</ref>\n\n===Quest for the Silmaril===\n{{Main|Quest for the Silmaril}}\nDuring such an occasion she was discovered by [[Beren]] as he wandered the woods of her father's kingdom, and instantly fell in love with her.  Daeron chirped out a warning, and she hid.  While he searched for her, he accidentally laid his hand on her arm.  He caught her alone some months later, and they grew to love one another. When Lúthien took Beren before her father, he was appalled that his royal daughter should wish to wed a mortal, and as is recounted in the ''[[Lay of Leithian]]'' so set Beren what he thought was an unachievable task, to recover a [[Silmaril]] from the [[Iron Crown]] of [[Morgoth]] himself. So Beren left Doriath in pursuit of his hopeless quest.\n[[File:Elena Kukanova - Encounter of Beren and Luthien.jpg|left|thumb|''Encounter of Beren and Luthien'' by [[Elena Kukanova]]]]\nAfter a time, a darkness fell on Lúthien's heart, and she learned from her mother Melian what this meant; Beren had been captured by [[Sauron]], and was held in the dungeons of [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]]. Though Thingol sought to stop her, Lúthien set out from Doriath to rescue Beren, if she could. Passing through many adventures, she gained the help of [[Huan the Hound]], and together they came to [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth|Sauron's Isle]]. She nearly fell to the force of Sauron's hatred alone, but through her magic and Huan's strength they defeated Sauron and rescued Beren. Eventually Beren set out for [[Angband]] once again, but this time Lúthien accompanied him.\n[[File:The Brothers Hildebrandt - The Silmarillion.jpg|thumb|175px|left|\"The Silmarillion\" by [[The Brothers Hildebrandt|Greg Hildebrandt]]]]\n[[File:Alan Lee - fluttering before his eyes, she wound a mazy-wingéd dance.jpg|thumb|''Fluttering before his eyes, she wound a mazy-wingéd dance'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]\nThrough Lúthien's powers, they passed the gates of Angband, and the great wolf [[Carcharoth]] that guarded them. Coming before the Dark Throne itself, Morgoth prepared to have both of them captured and killed, but Lúthien wove a spell and conducted a dance that put even Morgoth and his court into a deep sleep, and Beren cut a Silmaril from the Iron Crown. Returning to the gates, they found that Carcharoth barred their escape. Lúthien had been drained of her strength after putting the slumber over Angband and could not fight against the werewolf. Beren held up the hallowed jewel to protect them, but the monstrous wolf bit off his hand and, with it, consumed the Silmaril. But the Silmarils were blessed by [[Varda]] herself, so that any unclean flesh that touched them would be withered and burnt. The wolf's innards were consumed with that burning, and it ran howling into the south. Before the servants of Morgoth awakening beneath the mountains could pursue them, three [[Great Eagles]] came to the aid of Beren and Lúthien, bearing them away from [[Thangorodrim]].\n\nLúthien healed Beren, and they came at last back to her father's halls at [[Menegroth]]. There they heard tidings that the maddened wolf had entered Thingol's realm, and Beren set out with the King to the [[Hunting of the Wolf]]. After nightfall they returned; the wolf was slain and the Silmaril recovered, but Beren and Huan both were wounded mortally. Both passed away shortly after returning, and soon after Lúthien too wasted of grief.<ref name=\"Beren\">{{S|Beren}}</ref>\n\n===Aftermath and death===\n[[File:Tuuliky - The Death.jpg|thumb|left|''The Death'' by [[:Category:Images by Tuuliky|Tuuliky]]]]\nTheir spirits were gathered in the [[Halls of Mandos]] in the [[Uttermost West]], and there Lúthien sang a song of such extraordinary power and beauty that it moved even the implacable heart of [[Mandos]] himself. So she was granted a unique fate, to become mortal and return to [[Middle-earth]] with Beren, where they dwelt for a time in happiness on the green island of [[Tol Galen]] in the River [[Adurant]].<ref name=\"Beren\">{{S|Beren}}</ref> The lands surrounding the isle were later known as [[Dor Firn-i-Guinar]], \"Land of the Dead that Live\".<ref>{{S|20}}</ref>\n\nAfter the destruction of [[Doriath]] Beren participated in battle for the last time. He ambushed the routed [[dwarves]], and in the process also acquired the Silmaril he once took from Morgoth's crown. He brought the Silmaril, which was inside the [[Nauglamir]], to Lúthien, and she wore it until the day she and Beren died of old age. It is said that their deaths came quicker than expected because of the Silmaril, for the flame of the beauty of Lúthien as she wore the jewel was too bright for mortal lands.<ref>{{WJ|Years}}, p. 348</ref> After their death, the Silmaril was passed to their son [[Dior]], which caused the [[Second Kinslaying]].<ref>{{S|22}}</ref>\n\n===Final death===\nAmong the Children of [[Ilúvatar]] the final death of Beren and Lúthien is accounted in {{FA|503}} for in that year's autumn Dior received the Silmaril in Doriath, and it was taken as a sign of his parents' death.<ref name=\"TL351\">{{WJ|Years}}, p. 351.

The first element in the name is ''[[lúth]]'' (\"blossom, inflorescence\").<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 15</ref> The second element is the feminine suffix ''[[-ien]]'' (\"daughter\").\n\nIn early writings, [[Doriathrin]] ''Luthien'' and [[Noldorin]] ''Lhūthien'' meant \"enchantress\", deriving from [[Primitive Quendian]] ''luktiēnē'' (\"enchantress\"; from [[Sundocarme|root]] ''LUK'' \"magic, enhantement\").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry \"LUK\"</ref>\n\n''[[Tinúviel]]'' (from Primitive Quendian ''tindōmiselde'') means \"Nightingale\", or, more literally, \"Daughter of Twilight\".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry \"SEL-D\"</ref><ref>{{PE|19}}, p. 73</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| | ELU |y| MEL | | BEO | | | |ELU=[[Thingol|Elu Thingol]]|MEL=[[Melian]]|BEO=[[House of Bëor]]}}\n{{familytree| | | | |!| | | | | |!| | | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | | LUT |~|y|~| BER | | | |LUT='''LÚTHIEN'''|BER=[[Beren]]}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | DIO |y| NIM | | |DIO=[[Dior]]|NIM=[[Nimloth of Doriath|Nimloth]]}}\n{{familytree| | | | | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree| EAR |y| ELW | | ELD | | ELU |EAR=[[Eärendil]]|ELW=[[Elwing]]|ELD=[[Eluréd]]|ELU=[[Elurín]]}}\n{{familytree| |,|-|^|-|.| | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| ELR | | ELS | | | | | | | | |ELR=[[Elrond]]|ELS=[[Elros]]}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Inspiration==\nLúthien was largely inspired from [[Edith Bratt]] and when she died, Tolkien asked his son [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]] to include ''Lúthien'' in her gravestone, as he considered her \"my Lúthien.\"<ref>{{L|340}}, p. 420</ref> \n\n{{blockquote|I never called Edith 'Lúthien' – but she was the source of the story that in time became  the chief pan of the Silmarillion. It was first conceived in a small woodland glade filled with hemlocks at Roos in Yorkshire (where I was for a brief time in command of an outpost of the Humber Garrison in [[1917]], and she was able to live with me for a while).

The Welsh tale of [[Wikipedia:Culhwch and Olwen|Culhwch and Olwen]] is one such story. \n\nThe travel of Lúthien to Mandos and softening Námo with her song, in order to release her beloved, is a usual theme in mythology and religion: the Greek tale (as told by Ovid) of [[Wikipedia:Orpheus and Eurydice|Orpheus and Eurydice]] (see also the poem ''[[Sir Orpheo]]'', a medieval retale), the Japanese myth of [[Wikipedia:Izanagi|Izanagi and Izanami]], the Akkadian version of the Sumerian myth of [[Wikipedia:Inanna#Descent into the Underworld|Inanna's descent to the Underworld]], the Mayan myth of Ix Chel and Itzamna or the Indian legend of [[Wikipedia:Savitri and Satyavan|Savitri and Satyavan]].\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n[[File:Alan Lee - But Tevildo caught sight of her where she was perched.jpg|thumb|\"But Tevildo caught sight of her where she was perched\" by [[Alan Lee]]]]\nWhen the story of her love with Beren first appeared in the ''[[Lost Tales]]'', ''Tinúviel'' was her birth name and [[Daeron|Dairon]] was her brother.<ref>{{LT2|I}}, p. 41</ref> The idea that the name ''Tinúviel'' was given to her by Beren emerged in the early ''[[Lays of Beleriand]]'', along with her birth name ''Lúthien'' (although at first Tolkien tentatively gave her the birth name of ''[[Melilot Brandybuck#Other versions of the legendarium|Melilot]]'').<ref>{{LB|3}}, pp. 159, 179-180</ref>\n\nIn a crossed out note, her brother was [[Tinfang Warble|Timpinen]] and the two \"returned to the Eldar\" while their father never did.<ref>{{LT1|IVn}}, note 1</ref>\n\nIn some of the earlier writings, the story of Beren and Tinúviel was slightly different.
