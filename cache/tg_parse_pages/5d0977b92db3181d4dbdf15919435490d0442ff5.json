Its bearer was the nominal overlord of all the [[Noldor]]in realms, but had little practical authority due to the disunity of the Noldor. The [[House of Fëanor]] acknowledged the Kingship but paid it little heed, following their own agenda under the general leadership of [[Maedhros]].\n\n==Earlier Kings==\n{{main|King of the Noldor}}\n[[File:Marya Filatova - Refusal - Maedhros.jpg|thumb|''Refusal - Maedhros'' by [[Marya Filatova]]]]\nThe founder of the [[House of Finwë]] and first '''[[King of the Noldor]]''' was [[Finwë]], the lord of the [[Tatyar]] who led his people in the [[Great Journey]] from [[Cuiviénen]] into [[Aman|the West]] to dwell in [[Valinor]]. He was slain by [[Morgoth]] at [[Formenos]]. \n\nHis eldest son [[Fëanor]] succeeded to the Kingship and led the [[Rebellion of the Noldor]] to Middle-earth to avenge his father's death and recover the [[Silmarils]] from Morgoth.<ref>{{S|Darkening}}</ref> Fëanor died before establishing a realm, and the claim to the kingship passed to his eldest son [[Maedhros]], who was captured by Morgoth.\n\n[[Fingon]], son of [[Fingolfin]], rescued Maedhros from his captivity in a daring raid on [[Thangorodrim]]. Out of gratitude to Fingon, and regret that Fëanor had abandoned the other Noldor in [[Araman]], Maedhros surrendered his house's claim to the Kingship to Fingolfin. At that time, Maedhros said: \"''If there lay no grievance between us, lord, still the kingship would rightly come to you, '''the eldest''' here '''of the house of Finwë''', and not the least wise.''\" Thus the Kingship passed from the [[House of Fëanor]] to the [[House of Fingolfin]], fulfilling the [[Doom of Mandos]] that the [[Sons of Fëanor]] would become the ''Dispossessed'', and the two Houses made peace. However, not all of the seven Sons of Fëanor accepted this in their hearts.<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===First Age===\n'''[[Fingolfin]]''' became the first High King of the Noldor, ruling from [[Hithlum]] as the \"King of the North,\" mostly during the [[Siege of Angband]]. When Morgoth broke the leaguer in the [[Dagor Bragollach]] and slew many Noldor, Fingolfin rode in wrath to the gates of [[Angband]] and died in single combat with Morgoth.<ref name=Ruin>{{S|18}}</ref>\n\nFingolfin was succeeded by his eldest son '''[[Fingon]]''', whose short reign was consumed by endless war. He and Maedhros formed an [[Union of Maedhros|alliance]] that brought together all the realms of the Noldor to make a [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad|final assault]] on Morgoth. The attempt ended in the slaughter of the Noldor and Fingon's death at the hands of [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]], Lord of Balrogs.<ref name=Fifth>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>\n\nFingon's brother '''[[Turgon]]''' succeeded him, but he was High King in name only, as it was not possible for the \"Hidden King\" to rule the other Noldor from his [[Gondolin|Hidden City]], the location of which was unknown even to his own kin. When [[Maeglin]] betrayed this secret to Morgoth, the city swiftly [[Fall of Gondolin|fell]] and Turgon with it.\n\nGondolin was the last of the Noldorin realms in Beleriand and Turgon was the last son of the [[House of Fingolfin]]. With his death, the Kingship passed to the [[House of Finarfin]], which was by this time reduced to a single dynast: '''[[Gil-galad|Ereinion Gil-galad]]''', the young son of [[Orodreth]]. Gil-galad had been sent to take refuge with [[Círdan]] after the fall of [[Minas Tirith (Beleriand)|Minas Tirith]] in the aftermath of the Dagor Bragollach, and thus survived the ruin of the Noldor. Gil-galad was acclaimed High King when news of Turgon's death reached the [[Isle of Balar]], to which he and Círdan had fled from the fall of the [[Falas]].<ref>{{S|23}}</ref> Gil-galad lived to see the end of the [[Battles of Beleriand|War of the Jewels]] and held the Kingship throughout the [[Second Age]], far longer than any of his predecessors.\n \n===Second Age===\nAfter the cataclysmic [[War of Wrath]] that ended the [[First Age]] and destroyed Beleriand, the surviving [[Noldor]] who did not depart for the [[Undying Lands]] established the realms of [[Lindon]] and later [[Eregion]] in northwestern Middle-earth. In Lindon, Gil-galad was acknowledged as the \"High King of the Elves of the West\".<ref>{{App|B}}</ref> He was the chief enemy of [[Sauron]] in the [[Dark Years]], at the end of which he appointed Elrond as his vice-regent in [[Eriador]].<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Downfall of Númenor]], Gil-galad and [[Elendil]] formed the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] to destroy Sauron. In the ensuing [[War of the Last Alliance|war]] Gil-galad commanded the Elven forces, save for the host of [[Silvan Elves]] under [[Amdír]] and [[Oropher]]. After the Last Alliance broke into Mordor and [[Siege of Barad-dûr|besieged Barad-dûr]] for seven years, Sauron personally came forth and fought Gil-galad and Elendil. The battle ended in the deaths of all three, but Sauron's spirit and malice endured through the power of his [[One Ring]].<ref>{{UT|6b}}</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\nGil-galad was the last High King of the Noldor, for he fathered no children. With his death, the [[House of Finwë]] was extinguished in the male line in Middle-earth. The only living descendants of Finwë remaining in Middle-earth at the dawn of the Third Age were [[Galadriel]], [[Celebrían]], [[Elrond]], and the descendants of [[Elros]], who were counted among the race of Men.<ref>{{App|A1i}}</ref><ref group=\"note\">[[Maglor]]'s fate is unknown, so he may have been alive during the Third Age. Even if so, he was not seen again after end of the First Age.</ref>\n\n==List of High Kings==\n<!--Please do not add Finwë and Féanor to this list; they were never styled as \"High Kings\" in the published Silmarillion. -->\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
