It found its origin during the Soviet era, when dissident works were published and distributed privately.\n\n[[Mark T. Hooker]] first used the term to describe the many unauthorized or \"pirate\" translations of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s work in Russian, but over time the term has been adopted for translations in all languages. According to Olga Markova, there were at least ten unauthorized translations of [[The Lord of the Rings]] between [[1990]] and [[2005]].<ref>Olga Markova, [[Mark T.
