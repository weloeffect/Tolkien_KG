He asks her why she has come, to which she replies, \"Do you not know?\" He stops and tells her he cannot return her love for him. \n{{blockquote|I have wished you joy since first I saw you.|[[Aragorn]] to [[Éowyn]]}}\nHe leads his horse away and encounters [[Gimli]] and [[Legolas]], who tell him they are going with him. \n\nThe men of [[Rohan]] watch Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli leave the camp. They wonder why Aragorn is leaving with the coming battle now imminent. [[Gamling]] tells them that it is because there is no hope. [[Théoden]] enters the cluster of men and tells them all that \"he leaves because he must\", and that even though there is no hope of victory against the forces of [[Sauron]], the men of Rohan will nevertheless meet them in battle. \n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King scenes|31]]"}}}
