This scene was extended in the latter edition.\n\n==Synopsis==\nGandalf enters the [[Shire]], singing the lyrics to \"[[The Road Goes Ever On (song)|The Road Goes Ever On]]\".  He is ambushed by [[Frodo]], who has been excitedly waiting for Gandalf to arrive. Gandalf makes his way further into the Shire, going to [[Hobbiton]]. Frodo informs Gandalf of recent events, such as Bilbo's troubling behaviors.\n\nIn the extended edition, Bilbo has a brief panic attack when he thinks he has lost the [[Ring]], only to discover it is in his pocket. Bilbo's narration from the previous scene also completes.\n\n==Differences==\nThe scene is largely invented for the movie, but shows some inspirations from the text.\n\n*The song \"The road goes ever on and on\" is in fact a composition of Bilbo's, though Gandalf could possibly have heard it.\n*Frodo is not shown to meet Gandalf. His first proper appearance in the books is at the [[Farewell Party]].\n*Bilbo is not shown as having lost the ring, but the scene is consistent with his monologue in Chapter 1 regarding how he feels about the Ring.\n*Gandalf does not show off any fireworks before the party.\n\n{{title}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring scenes|03]]"}}}
