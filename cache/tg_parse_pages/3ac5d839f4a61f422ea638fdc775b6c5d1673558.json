It is held to be the national epic of Finland and is traditionally thought of as one of the most significant works of Finnish literature.\n\n\"Kalevala\" is the name of the homeland of the heroes in the book ''Kalevala''. \n\n==Tolkien and the ''Kalevala''==\nThe Finnish mythology, as presented in the ''Kalevala'', had a profound impact on the young [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], and became an inspiration for the creation of his [[Legendarium]]. In an early letter to [[Edith Bratt]], Tolkien mentions that he is doing a reworking of one of the stories from the ''Kalevala'' (resulting in the manuscript \"[[The Story of Kullervo]]\").<ref>{{L|1}}</ref> In [[1955]], writing to his friend [[W.H. Auden]], he says that ''\"the beginning of the legendarium [...] was in an attempt to reorganize some of the Kalevala, especially the tale of Kullervo the hapless, into a form of my own\"''.<ref>{{L|163}}</ref>\n\n===Túrin Turambar and Kullervo===\n[[Image:Gallen Kallela Kullervos Curse.jpg|thumb|\"Kullervo's Curse\" by [[:Wikipedia:Akseli Gallen-Kallela|Akseli Gallen-Kallela]]]]\n{{quote|The germ of my attempt to write legends of my own to fit my private languages was the tragic tale of the hapless Kullervo in the Finnish ''Kalevala''.

But soon the maid gives birth to Kullervo. Later Kullervo is sold to Ilmarinen, from who he soon escapes. Kullervo finds out that her parents are alive as well, and hears from them that his sister has disappeared. Kalervo has to go to pay the families taxes, and on his way back Kullervo meets a fair maiden and seduces her. Afterwards she realizes that Kullervo is her brother, and out of shame she jumps into rapids and drowns. Desperate and self destructive Kullervo returns home and attacks Untamo and slays him. After the killing he talks to his sword, and says that it has bled a lot of innocent blood, and tells it that now the sword can bleed some guilty blood as well. The sword replies: \n\n{{blockquote|Thus his trusty sword makes answer,<br />\nWell divining his intentions:<br />\n'Why should I not drink thy life-blood,<br />\nBlood of guilty Kullerwoinen,<br />\nSince I feast upon the worthy,<br />\nDrink the life-blood of the righteous?'|Canto XXXVI, vv.302-309}}\n\nAfter the sword replies, Kullervo thrusts himself to the blade and dies.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[The Story of Kullervo]]''\n*''[[The Children of Húrin]]''\n\n==External links==\n*{{WP|Kalevala}}\n*[http://jultika.oulu.fi/Record/nbnfioulu-201804201498 Researching J.R.R.
