[[Old Man Willow]] lived within the valley and seemed to have some measure of control over the forest, inspiring much of the anger that permeated the limbs of the trees.<ref name=\"FRforest\" />\n\nThe [[Hobbits]] believed the trees of the Old Forest were in some manner 'awake', and hostile. They swayed when there was no wind, whispered at night, and misled travellers deeper into the forest. The trees did indeed carry malice and a hatred, but this hatred was not connected to the evil stemming from the East and Mordor. The forest had been angered by the years of tree-felling and destruction that they had witnessed, and the trees would lash out at travellers, whether they meant good or ill.<ref name=\"FRforest\" />\n\nHobbits who passed through felt a sense of being watched by the forest itself. The paths in the forest, which seemed at first to be true, would angle downward into the valley of the [[Withywindle]].<ref name=\"FRforest\" /> The hobbits mostly referred to the forest as queer, and dangerous rather than evil.<ref>{{FR|Conspiracy}}, p. 107</ref> Hobbits also blamed the Old Forest for the queerness of the [[Brandybucks]] due to its proximity to [[Buckland]]<ref>{{FR|Party}}, p. 22</ref>\n==History==\n[[File:Chechula Čupová-Hobbit at the Old Forest.jpg|thumb|left|''Hobbit at the Old Forest'' by [[:Category:Images by Chechula Čupová|Chechula Čupová]]|261x261px]]The Old Forest was one of the few remains of the vast primordial forests which covered most of [[Eriador]] before the [[Second Age]],<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref> being its northern edge. What became known as the Old Forest was what survived the deforestation by the [[Númenóreans]] and the [[Dark Years|wars]] against [[Sauron]].<ref>{{UT|4}}</ref> It was part of [[Arnor]] (and [[Cardolan]]) during the existence of the North-kingdom.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 148</ref>\n\nWhen [[Angmar]] attacked Arnor in {{TA|1409}}, some [[Dúnedain of Arnor|Dúnedain of Cardolan]] fled into the Forest.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>\n\nIn the later years, [[Gorhendad Oldbuck]] colonized the stripe of land between the [[Baranduin|Brandywine]] and the Old Forest; the Hobbits of Buckland cut the forest to make room for their new homes, and also built [[High Hay|the Hedge]], a large wall separating their country from the Forest. When the trees grew too close to the hedge, hobbits cut down the trees nearest and created a clearing by a [[Bonfire Glade|bonfire]]. After that, the trees were more hostile.<ref name=\"FRforest\">{{FR|Forest}}</ref>\n\nJust before the [[War of the Ring]], the Hobbits [[Frodo Baggins]], [[Samwise Gamgee]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and [[Peregrin Took]] crossed through it trying to escape from the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]]. While passing through the forest, Old Man Willow cast a spell on the hobbits, causing them to feel sleepy. Merry and Pippin leaned against the trunk and fell asleep, and were subsequently trapped in cracks in the trunk, while Frodo sat on a root to dangle his feet in the water, before also falling asleep and being pushed in by Old Man Willow. Sam managed to fight off the spell and rescued Frodo from the stream. They attempted to save Merry and Pippin by lighting a fire at the tree's base, but this only angered Old Man Willow more. They were saved by the timely arrival of [[Tom Bombadil]] who knew \"the tune for him\".<ref name=\"FRforest\" />\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===The Old Forest in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:War in Middle Earth - The Old Forest.png|Old Forest in ''[[J.R.R.
