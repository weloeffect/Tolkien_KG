His wife was [[Vairë (wife of Lindo)|Vairë]], and his father was [[Valwë]].<ref name=Cottage>{{LT1|I}}</ref>{{rp|14}}\n\n== History ==\nThe mariner [[Eriol]], who searched for strange lands, eventually came to the isle of Tol Eressëa. There he wandered, until reaching the center of the isle and the city of [[Kortirion]]. Growing tired as the night drew in, he sought for a place to rest. He spotted The [[Cottage of Lost Play]], with its many small windows curtained snugly, filled with a warm light. He knocked on the door as was greeted by the Lord of the Cottage, Lindo and his wife Vairë.\n\nAfter introductions, Lindo explained that the dwelling was called Mar Vanwa Tyaliéva, or the Cottage of Lost Play. Alongside him there were many other elves, and mannish children of various sizes. He perceived Eriol's curiosity and said: \"''Small is the dwelling, but smaller still are they that dwell here - for all who enter must be very small indeed, or of their own good wish become as very little folk even as they stand upon the threshold''.\"<ref name=Cottage/>{{rp|13–4}}\n\nLindo and Vairë accepted Eriol's request for entrance and lodging, and invited him in. Soon after, they made their way to the great hall, where an evening meal was set out. [[Gong of the Children|Tombo]], the Gong of Children rang out and all the children of the dwelling joined them for supper, including [[Littleheart]], the Gong-warden. They sang the song of the [[Bringing in of the Meats]] and Lindo blessed the food and company.\n\nDuring dinner, Eriol asked Lindo and his wife about the isle of Tol Eressëa. Lindo explained Eriol had come into the region of [[Alalminórë]], or the Land of Elms at the center of the isle, which was the fairest of the realms of Tol Eressëa, and then to the city above it of Kortirion. He told of the isle's leader [[Meril-i-Turinqi]], who was a descendant of [[Ingwë|Inwë]], the King of all the Eldar when they dwelt in [[Kôr]]. At this isle is where many of the wisest and fairest of all the Eldar gathered, including Lindo's father [[Valwë]], and his wife's father [[Tulkastor]].<ref name=Cottage/>{{rp|14–6}}\n\nAll but Eriol filled their cups with [[limpë]], which was a special drink that would give youth, but that only Meril-i-Turinqi could give to one who was not Eldar or that already dwelt with them. The gong sounded again, and the company moved to the [[Room of Logs]] where a magic fire burnt endlessly. There they would gather often for story time and now Vairë told him the history of the land. She spoke of [[Olórë Mallë]], or the Path of Dreams, and of a white cottage that stood in its fairest garden. None knew of what it was built or when. This was then called the Cottage of Children and the Eldar guarded it fiercely, goading the children of men to play there. This was to protect them from straying into Valinor and abandoning their parents or returning and being unsatisfied with the world ever after. After the elves left Kôr, the Cottage of Children was abandoned and blocked off forever.<ref name=Cottage/>{{rp|17–9}}\n\nMeril-i-Turinqi chose Lindo and Vairë to care for the remainder of the children who had been to Kôr. The two built the new Cottage of Lost Play where the children then lived, though some would depart to the [[Middle-earth|Great Lands]], and stay, becoming lost in the wonderous lands there. The rest return and bring stories to Lindo and Vairë.<ref name=Cottage/>{{rp|20}}\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Lindo'' is a [[Qenya]] name, probably meaning \"Singer\". The [[Gnomish]] version of the name was '''''Glinda''''' (probably related to ''glin'' \"sound, voice, utterance\").<ref>{{PE|15}}, pp. 6-7, 9</ref>\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| | | WOD | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |WOD=[[wikipedia:Odin|Wóden]]}}\n{{familytree| | | |:| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | |:| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | HED | | | | | | | | TUL | | | | VAL |HED=[[Heden]]|TUL=[[Tulkastor]]|VAL=[[Valwë]]}}\n{{familytree| |,|-|^|-|.| | | | | |,|-|^|-|.| | | |!| |}}\n{{familytree| BEO | | EOH | | | | SIB | | VAI |~| LIN |BEO=[[Beorn (son of Heden)|Beorn]]|EOH=[[Eoh]]|SIB=''unknown<br />sibling''|VAI=[[Vairë (wife of Lindo)|Vairë]]|LIN='''LINDO'''}}\n{{familytree| | | | | |!| | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| CWE |y| ERI |~|~|y| NAI | | | | | | | | |CWE=[[Cwén]]|ERI=[[Eriol]]|NAI=[[Naimi]]}}\n{{familytree| |,|-|^|-|.| | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| HEN | | HOR | | HEO | | | | | | | | | | |HEN=[[wikipedia:Hengist and Horsa|Hengest]]|HOR=[[wikipedia:Hengist and Horsa|Horsa]]|HEO=[[Heorrenda]]}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Elves]]\n[[Category:Qenya names]]\n[[de:Lindo]]"}}}
