The only excerpt from these songs is \"''Mithrandir, Mithrandir, O Pilgrim Grey!''\".<ref>{{FR|II7}}</ref>\n\nThis was expanded and set to music by [[Philippa Boyens]] and [[Howard Shore]], respectively, for [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]. It was sung in the said film by [[Elizabeth Fraser]] in the track ''[[Lothlórien (song)|Lothlórien]]''. Notable about this song is that it assumes that the elves of Lothlórien were aware that Gandalf was an incarnate Maia. This is debatable. As well, the lyrics ask \"''What drove you to leave/That which you loved?''\". This suggests that Gandalf was well aware that he would fall in [[Moria]]. Other debatable verses include the claims that Gandalf was the wisest of the Maiar, and that with him the [[Flame of Anor]] would leave the world (assuming that it and he were one, or he was the only wielder of the Flame).\n\n==Lyrics in Peter Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring==\nThe first part is in [[Quenya]]:\n:''A [[Gandalf|Olórin]] i yáresse''<br>''Mentaner i Númenherui''<br>''Tírien i Rómenóri ''<br>''[[Maiar]]on i Oiosaila''<br>''Manan elye etevanne''<br>''Nórie i melanelye?''\n\nThe Second part is in [[Sindarin]]:\n:''Mithrandir, Mithrandir, A Randir Vithren''<br>''ú-reniathach i amar galen''<br>''I reniad lín ne mór, nuithannen''<br>''In gwidh ristennin, i fae  narchannen''<br>''I lach [[Sun|Anor]] ed ardhon gwannen''<br>''Caled veleg, ethuiannen.''\n\n===Translation===\n:''Olórin, who once was...''<br>''Sent by the [[Valar|Lords of the West]]''<br>''To guard the [[Middle-earth|lands of the East]]''<br>''Wisest of all [[Maiar]]''<br>''What drove you to leave''<br>''That which you loved?''\n\n:''Mithrandir, Mithrandir O Pilgrim Grey''<br>''No more will you wander the green fields of this earth''<br>''Your journey has ended in darkness.''<br>''The bonds cut, the spirit broken''<br>''The [[Flame of Anor]] has left this [[Arda|World]]''<br>''A great light, extinguished.''\n\nSee also ''[[Frodo's Lament]]'', another song for Gandalf.\n\n{{references}}\n* [http://elvish.org/gwaith/movie.htm The Fellowship of the Wordsmiths]\n\n[[Category:Songs]]"}}}
