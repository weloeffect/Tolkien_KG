Marigold was invented by [[Amazon Studios]] for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'', where she was portrayed by [[Sara Zwangobani]].<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9788618/fullcredits|articlename=Full Cast & Crew|dated=|website=IMDb|accessed=28 July 2022}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:The Rings of Power (TV series) - Marigold Brandyfoot poster.jpg|thumb|200px|The ''Marigold Brandyfoot poster'' for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'']]\nMarigold was born during the latter half of the [[Second Age]]. After Largo had lost his first wife, [[Rose Brandyfoot]], he met Marigold within a clearing of the [[Norfield Glen]]. She helped him move on from his grief, healing him from feeling \"''like the wheels broke out from under''\" him. Afterwards, they became married, and Marigold took on the [[Brandyfoot family|Brandyfoot]] name. Eventually they had two children together: [[Elanor Brandyfoot|Elanor]] and [[Dilly Brandyfoot|Dilly]].\n\nAfter Largo broke his left ankle when a rope snapped, Marigold grew afraid that that the caravan would be forced to leave them behind on the migration due to the wound. However, Largo attempted to heal her despair by reminding her that she had helped him when he was grieving for Rose Brandyfoot.\n\nLater, when [[The Stranger]] accidentally destroyed the Harfoot [[Harvest Festival]] during [[Sadoc Burrows|Trailfinder Sadoc's]] remembrance speech, Elanor's rule breaking was made known, and Sadoc forced the Brandyfoot cart to be put at the back of the caravan during the migration from the [[Norfield Glen]] to the [[Grove]], dooming them to the very real possibility of being left behind. Despite this, Marigold allows the Stranger to aid them in keeping up with the caravan.\n\nUpon arriving at the shockingly ruined Grove, the Stranger attempts to heal the orchard. Despite this, however, a tree branch broke off, nearly harming Elanor and Dilly, putting Marigold into a panic.\n\nAfter the Stranger leaves and the [[Mystics]] burn the carts to the ground in their pursuit, Marigold, alongside [[Sadoc Burrows]], Elanor, and [[Poppy Proudfellow]], leave the Grove to warn the Stranger and seek revenge on the Mystics. After the battle against the Mystics within the [[East Bight]], Marigold and the other [[Brandyfoot family|Brandyfoots]] say their farewells to Elanor, who decides to accompany the Stranger on a journey to find out more about the [[Hermit's Hat]].\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | ROS |~| LAR |y| MAR | | | | |ROS=[[Rose Brandyfoot]]<br/><small>''b. {{SA}}-unknown''</small>|LAR=[[Largo Brandyfoot]]<br/><small>''b. {{SA}}''</small>|MAR='''MARIGOLD BRANDYFOOT'''<br/><small>''b. {{SA}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | |,|-|^|-|.| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | ELA | | DIL | | | | |ELA=[[Elanor Brandyfoot]]<br/><small>''b. {{SA}}''</small>|DIL=[[Dilly Brandyfoot]]<br/><small>''b. {{SA}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Hobbits from adaptations]]\n\n[[fi:Marigold Brandyfoot (televisiosarjan hahmo)]]"}}}
