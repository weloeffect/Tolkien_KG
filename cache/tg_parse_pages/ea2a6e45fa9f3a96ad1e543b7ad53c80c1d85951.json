''Lemba''s was made first by [[Yavanna]] from special [[corn]] that grew in [[Aman]], and [[Oromë]] gave it to the Elves for the purpose of the [[Great Journey]]. For this reason, it was an Elven custom that only women should make ''lembas''; they were called ''[[Yavannildi]]'' who knew the secret of its recipe from Oromë.<ref name=\"Making\">{{NM|P3iv}}, \"Text 2\", p. 296</ref> Also, the custom mandated that only an Elven Queen should keep and distribute the ''lembas''; for this reason she was called also ''[[massánië]]'' or ''besain''.<ref name=\"Lembas\" />\n\n[[File:Elena Kukanova - The Light of Valinor.jpg|200px|thumb|left|''The Light of Valinor'' by [[Elena Kukanova]]]]\nOnly on rare occasions was it given to non-Elves, because it was believed that mortals who ate it would become weary of their mortality and would desire to live among the Elves.<ref name=\"Lembas\">{{PM|Lembas}}, pp. 403-404</ref>\n\nThe corn was an enduring plant that needed but a little sunlight to ripen and could be sown at any season and then sprouted and grew swiftly. Yet it was harmed by north winds, while [[Morgoth]] dwelt there. The Eldar grew it in guarded lands and sunlit glades. The ears were harvested without scythe or sickle but each one was gathered by hand, and the white stalks were drawn from the earth and used to weave baskets in which the grain was stored.<ref name=\"Lembas\" />\n\n[[Melian]], as the queen of [[Doriath]], was one who held the recipe from Yavanna. By giving ''lembas'' to [[Beleg]] for [[Túrin]],<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref> Melian showed him great favour because it had never before been given to Men and seldom was again. Later it was passed to [[Galadriel]] and other Elves.\n\nWhen ships had been sent forth, at the behest of [[Turgon]], towards the West, its mariners carried a sealed wallet with waybread for their voyage. [[Voronwë]], after surviving the wreck, shared it with [[Tuor]] throughout their journey to [[Gondolin]].<ref name=\"UT1\">{{UT|1}}</ref>\n\nDúnedain, inspired by the elves, made a similar kind of waybread (although it was not true ''lembas''), that they carried on long journeys. So each of Isildur's soldiers on their way north from the [[War of the Last Alliance]] \"carried in a sealed wallet on his belt a small phial of cordial and wafers of a waybread that would sustain life in him for many days\".<ref>{{UT|7}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Galadhrim]] had a large store of ''lembas'' in [[Lothlórien]]. Galadriel gave some of it to the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] upon their departure.<ref name=\"Farewell\">{{FR|Farewell}}</ref> [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]] subsisted on it through the majority of their journey from there into [[Mordor]].\n\nThe tradition of farming the [[Western Corn]] and the making of waybread was lost for ever in Middle-earth after the departure of Galadriel and the death of [[Arwen]].<ref name=\"Making\" />\n\n==Description==\nThe cakes were very nutritious, stayed fresh for months when wrapped in leaves, and were used for sustenance on long journeys. ''Lembas'' had a brownish colour on the outside and a cream colour on the inside. \n\nAccording to [[Gimli]], it was a food of the same kind as ''[[Cram]]'', although one of the [[Galadhrim|Elves of Lothlórien]] commented that it was more pleasant, and more strengthening than any food made by [[Men]].<ref name=\"Farewell\" />\n\nLike other products of the Elves, it was offensive to evil creatures; [[Gollum]] refused outright to eat of it.<ref>{{TT|IV2}}</ref> When Frodo was captured by [[Orcs]] in Mordor, the Orcs hated the look of the ''lembas'' even more than Gollum had.<ref>{{RK|VI1}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nLembas is [[Sindarin]] and derived from [[Old Sindarin]] ''lenn-mbass'' which means \"journey-bread\". As a rough translation of this term it was also often called \"waybread\".<ref name=\"Lembas\" /> This word came in turn from [[Primitive Elvish]] ''le''(''n'')''dembassē'', literally meaning \"bread taken on leaving home (for a long journey)\", which in [[Quenya]] was '''''lerembas'''''.<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, pp. 51-52</ref> However, the proper Quenya term for ''lembas'' was '''''coimas''''' which means \"life-bread\".<ref name=\"Lembas\" />\n\n==Inspiration==\n''Lembas'' has been compared with the Eucharist, even as being the most explicit symbol of [[Christianity]] in ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref>[[Bradley J. Birzer]], ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien's Sanctifying Myth]]'', \"Chapter 3: The Created Order\", p. 63</ref> Tolkien himself mentions that the ''lembas'' is one of the few details from which it can be deduced he is a Catholic writer.<ref>{{L|213}}, p. 288</ref> He acknowledged the religious significance of ''lembas'' in a letter about a proposal for a film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings''. (The proposal called lembas a 'food concentrate', which Tolkien objected to as \"scientification\".)<ref>{{L|210}}, pp. 274-275</ref> Like \"''lembas'',\" \"viaticum,\" a term for the Eucharist, means \"provision for a journey.\"\n\nThe name \"waybread\" resembles in a way the [[Old English]] name for the herb [[Wikipedia:plantago|plantain]], which was ''wegbrade''.<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/ed/study_a_s_2.html|articlename=Tolkien Society Anglo-Saxon Study Pack 2|dated=2006|website=[http://www.tolkiensociety.org The Tolkien Society]}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''\n:The redundant term \"''lembas'' bread\" is occasionally used as the gift of ''lembas'' at Lothlórien is not included in the theatrical release of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.
