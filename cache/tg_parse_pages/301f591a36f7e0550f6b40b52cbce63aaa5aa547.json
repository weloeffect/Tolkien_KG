Men speculated that he had gained the displeasure of the king and had fled on a long voyage. However, the truth was that he was on a mysterious mission and would likely never be seen again or be seen again too late.<ref>{{LR|P1III2}}, p. 62</ref> He left behind his daughter, Fíriel, in Elendil's house where she sang a [[Fíriel's song|sad song]] from a high window.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe meaning of ''Oronto'' is never given, but it could include the [[Quenya]] element ''[[oron]]'' (\"mountain\"). The name was created in an early step of Quenya development, but it was later used as an example of ''anessi'' (\"given name\").<ref>{{PE|21}}, p. 86</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\n[[Christopher Tolkien]] points out that Orontor's mission, \"from which he might never return\", could be a precedent of the voyage of [[Amandil]] to the West in the final version of ''[[Akallabêth]]''.<ref>{{LR|P1III2}}, ''Note on the Númenórean chapters'', p. 71</ref> \n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Men]]\n[[Category:Númenóreans]]\n[[Category:The Lost Road]]"}}}
