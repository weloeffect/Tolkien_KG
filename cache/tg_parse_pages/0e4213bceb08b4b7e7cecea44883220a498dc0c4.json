At this time, the Second Marshal was Théoden's son [[Théodred]], whose command was based at [[Helm's Deep]]. Théodred, exceeding the authority of his post as Second Marshall, assumed general command and made orders concerning the [[Muster of Edoras]], normally under the command of the [[First Marshal of the Riddermark|First Marshal]], the bulk of which he placed under the command of [[Elfhelm]].\n\nThéodred's men were defeated by [[Saruman]]'s forces at the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]], in which Théodred was slain. After that time, the traditional ranks were not strictly adhered to.  At the Full Muster ahead of the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], Elfhelm became a Marshall of the Riddermark, commanding the Muster of the East-mark, however the title of Second Marshall was not given. After the [[War of the Ring]], [[Éomer]] (formerly the [[Third Marshal of the Riddermark]]), became King and revised the old tradition of the three marshals, giving Elfhelm the new title of [[Marshal of the East-mark]].<ref>{{UT|11b}}</ref>{{References}}\n{{rohirrimranks}}\n[[Category:Mannish titles]]\n[[Category:Rohan]]\n[[fi:Markin marsalkka]]"}}}
