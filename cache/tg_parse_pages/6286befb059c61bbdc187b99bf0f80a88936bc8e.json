During most of its course it was the border between [[East Beleriand]] and [[West Beleriand]]. From the [[Pass of Sirion]] to its mouth, the river was 130 leagues in length.<ref name=\"Beleriand\">{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n=== Sources ===\nThe Sirion's source was at [[Eithel Sirion]] on the eastern side of the [[Ered Wethrin]], which lay in between [[Ard-galen]] (later Anfauglith) and [[Mithrim]] and [[Hithlum]].<ref name=\"Map\">{{S|Map}}</ref> It was guarded by the tower of [[Barad Eithel]].<ref name=\"Beleriand\"/>\n\n=== Course ===\nSirion flowed southwards along the border of the Ered Wethrin, passing through the [[Fen of Serech]] before entering the narrow steep-sided valley between the Ered Wethrin and the [[Echoriath]] named the Pass of Sirion. Sirion then continued south into Beleriand, with the [[Forest of Brethil]] to the west, and [[Dimbar]] and then [[Doriath]] to the east. After leaving Doriath at Aelin-uial (the [[Fens of Sirion]]) it plunged below ground in the [[Falls of Sirion]] at [[Andram]] (the Long Wall), where the ground fell steeply. Three leagues southwards the Sirion exited the underground caves at the [[Gates of Sirion]]. It then flowed southwards through [[Nan-tathren|Nan-Tathren]] until it reached the [[Bay of Balar]], part of [[Belegaer]], at the [[Mouths of Sirion]].<ref name=\"Map\"/>\n\n=== Tributaries ===\nIn order from north to south, the principal tributaries of the Sirion were the [[Rivil]], flowing from Dorthonion until it met Sirion in the Fen of Serech; the former [[Dry River]], the [[Mindeb]], which had its source in [[Nan Dungortheb]] and the [[Ered Gorgoroth]], the [[Teiglin]], the [[Esgalduin]] of Doriath; the [[Aros]] flowing south from Dorthonion and west along the [[Forest of Region]] (and also containing the waters of the [[Celon]] from the Hills of [[Himring]] and [[Himlad]]) which met at Aelin-uial, and the [[Narog]], which joined Sirion in Nan-Tathren.<ref name=\"Map\"/>\n\n=== Crossing Points ===\nThe main crossing point was the [[Ford of Brithiach]] where the road from Himlad which crossed the Esgalduin at [[Iant Iaur]] crossed Sirion north of [[Brethil]]. There was also a bridge within Doriath.<ref name=\"Map\"/> King [[Thingol]]'s [[Marchwardens]] also kept secret ferries near [[Aelin-uial]] to cross the river.<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>\n\n=== Settlements ===\nBarad Eithel, at the source of the Sirion in the Ered Wethrin, was a chief fortress of [[Fingolfin]] and his son [[Fingon]],<ref name=\"Beleriand\"/> which guarded the pass into their realm of Mithrim. Further south, in the [[Pass of Sirion]], lay [[Tol Sirion]] (see below). After the Coming of Men, the [[Edain]] of the [[House of Haleth]] made their home in the Forest of Brethil,<ref>{{S|West}}</ref> and the [[Sindar]] ruled by [[Thingol]] lay secure within the Girdle of [[Melian]] in their realm of Doriath.<ref>{{S|Sindar}}</ref> At the outflow of Sirion into Belegaer, after the destruction of [[Eglarest]] and [[Brithombar]], the Havens of Sirion were built by [[Círdan]] and his people.<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>\n\n=== Islands ===\nThe most important island in Sirion was Tol Sirion.<ref name=\"Map\"/> The original [[Minas Tirith (Beleriand)|Minas Tirith]] was built here by [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] in the strategic location controlling the Pass of Sirion where it entered Beleriand between the Ered Wethrin and the Echoriath.<ref name=\"Beleriand\"/> Shortly after [[Dagor Bragollach]] it was captured by Sauron and the island became known as [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]].<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Sirion'' is [[Sindarin]] for \"Great River\"<ref>{{S|Index}}, entry \"Sirion\"</ref> or \"Great Stream\",<ref name=Eldarin>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 42</ref> from ''[[sîr]]'' (\"river\")<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entry ''[[sîr]]''</ref> with the suffix ''iaun'' (\"roomy, wide, extensive\") simplified.<ref name=Eldarin>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 42</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\n{{expansion}}\nAccording to one note in the early version of the [[legendarium]] associated with ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', the river Sirion was to be equated with either the river [[wikipedia:Rhine|Rhine]] in [[wikipedia:Europe|Europe]], or with the river [[wikipedia:River Trent|Trent]] (emended to [[wikipedia:Severn|Severn]]) in [[wikipedia:England|England]].<ref>{{PE|15}}, \"[[Names and Required Alterations]]\", Appendix, ''Text IX'', p. 16</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Gnomish locations]]\n[[Category:Noldorin locations]]\n[[Category:Qenya locations]]\n[[Category:Rivers of Beleriand]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n\n[[de:Sirion]]\n[[fi:Sirion]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/eaux/beleriand/sirion]]"}}}
