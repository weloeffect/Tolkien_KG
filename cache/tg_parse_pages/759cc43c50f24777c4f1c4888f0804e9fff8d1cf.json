He was also at one point the [[Warden of the Great Gate]] of [[Gondolin]]. Ecthelion had the most beautiful voice and greatest musical talent with the flute of all the people of Gondolin.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Turner Mohan - Glorfindel and Ecthelion.jpg|thumb|left|''Glorfindel and Ecthelion'' by [[:Category:Images by Turner Mohan|Turner Mohan]]]]\nIn the year {{FA|472}}, Ecthelion fought alongside [[Turgon]] in the battle [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], leading a wing of Gondolin's forces. Upon the defeat of the Noldor, he defended a flank as Turgon retreated.<ref>{{S|20}}</ref> Surviving the disastrous battle, Ecthelion returned towards the Hidden City where he next appeared as Warden of the [[Gate of Steel|Great Gate]].\n\nTwenty-three years after Nirnaeth Arnoediad, [[Tuor]] and [[Voronwë]] traveled towards the Hidden City. After being led by [[Elemmakil]] through the [[Seven Gates of Gondolin|Seven Gates]], Ecthelion appeared before them. He is portrayed as great and lordly, all clad in silver and having a bright glance. Upon his helm there was a spike with a diamond point, and he bore a shield which shimmered as \"a thousand studs of crystal\". At first denying passage for Tuor, he allows it after the latter shows the arms of [[Vinyamar]] and mentions [[Ulmo]], saying that the Lord of the Fountains should not oppose the Lord of the Waters.<ref>{{UT|1}}, pp. 50-51</ref>\n\nIn the year {{FA|510}}, [[Morgoth]] attacked the city. Ecthelion battled there against [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs]] in the [[Square of the Palace|Place of the Fountain]], where they slew each other.<ref>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref> The battle was well detailed in ''[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]'', and long remembered by the elves.\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Ecthelion.mp3|Ardamir}}\nWith the development of the [[Elvish]] languages, the name ''Ecthelion'' had its own evolution. \n\nThe early [[Gnomish]] conception meant \"Lord of the Fountains\",<ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 31</ref> from ''ecthel'' (\"issue of water, spring\").<ref>{{LT2|Appendix}}, entry \"Ecthelion\"</ref> Its [[Qenya]] cognate was '''''Ektelion'''''.<ref>{{PE|13}}, p. 104</ref>\n\nIn the [[Noldorin]] stage of the name, it is composed from ''[[ehtë]]'' (\"spear\") and ''[[thela]]'' (\"point\" of spear).<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries \"EK-\", \"STELEG-\"</ref> Put together they could be translated as \"Spear-point\" or \"Spear-head\".\n\nThe [[Sindarin]] version should have been '''''Ægthelion''''', derived from ''[[aeg]]'' (\"sharp\") + ''[[Estel|thel]]'' (\"intent, resolve\") + ''[[-on]]'' (masculine suffix). However, Tolkien wrote that the early ''Ecthelion'' sounded good and it had already been used in publication (with the name of two [[Ecthelion (disambiguation)|ruling stewards]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''), so he let it as a late colloquial form of the archaic Sindarin name ''Ægthelion''<ref name=\"Maeglin\" />{{rp|318–9}}, which can be translated as \"One with Sharp Will\".<ref>{{HM|GS}}, p. 339</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n===The Book of Lost Tales===\nThe most detailed text about Ecthelion and his deeds during the Fall of Gondolin is the chapter \"[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]\", in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. There it is told that he is the lord of the [[house of the Fountain]], one of the [[twelve houses of the Gondothlim]]. Its people found delight in diamonds and the silver of their arrays was most beautiful to the sight.<ref name=\"Gondolin\">{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|173}} \n[[File:Mysilvergreen - Death of Ecthelion, Lord of the Fountain.jpg|thumb|right|''Death of Ecthelion, Lord of the Fountain'' by [[:Category:Images by Mysilvergreen|Mysilvergreen]]]]\nDuring the siege of the city, Ecthelion led his folk into battle accompanied by the music of their flutes, and great were the damages caused to the enemy by their long, bright swords.<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|173}} He and his forces made their entrance from the South part of the city, after previously being held in reserve. So terrible was his voice when commanding the drawing of the swords and the killings which followed, that his name became a terror among the enemy and a war-cry to the [[Eldar]]. Valiantly fighting side by side with Tuor and his [[house of the Wing]], they drove away the [[orcs]] until the gate was almost regained. It is said that Ecthelion and his house of the Fountain slew more orcs than had ever been slain, in all the battles of elves and orcs combined. Ecthelion killed three [[Balrogs]] and his sword did \"hurt to their fire\". However, [[dragons]] reinforced [[Melko]]'s army. Outnumbered, they had to retreat. When doing so, Ecthelion's left arm was wounded and his shield fell to earth. Tuor carried him away as they joined the remaining leaders in the [[Square of the King]].<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|180–2}} \n\nIn that place the great [[Square of the Palace|Fountain of the King]] stood and Ecthelion regained his strength by drinking from it. As seven dragons lead the enemy's forces towards the Square, the remaining army of Gondolin began retreat. All but Ecthelion, who remained near the fountain in a stand which was remembered as the most valiant \"in all the songs or in any tale\". There Gothmog lord of Balrogs beated down [[Egalmoth]], but Ecthelion came inbetween despite being pale as steel. During the duel, Ecthelion was wounded in the hand and lost his sword. Gothmog then was about to deliver a blow with his whip when Ecthelion jumped and drove the spike of his helmet into Gothmog's body. Twining his legs with the enemy's, both fell into the Fountain of the King. Gothmog died there with Ecthelion, sank because of his steel armor.<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|183–4}} \n\nLater, during the escape of the [[Exiles of Gondolin]], the young [[Eärendel]] asked about him, saying that he wished Ecthelion were there, \"''to play to me on his flute, or make me willow whistles! Perchance has he gone on ahead?''\" After he was informed of Ecthelion's death he \"wept bitterly\" and said that he cared no more to see the streets of Gondolin.<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|191}}\n\n===Aredhel's escort===\nWhile composing the chapter about [[Maeglin]], [[Tolkien]] considered Ecthelion, [[Glorfindel]] and [[Egalmoth]] as the escort of Aredhel when she left the [[Gondolin|Hidden City]] to visit [[Fingon]].<ref name=\"Maeglin\" />{{rp|318}} However, in the published ''[[Silmarillion]]'', [[Christopher Tolkien]] did not mention any of the escorts of Aredhel, based on a note in which Tolkien decided that it was necessary ''not'' to name the most eminent and bravest chieftains as Aredhel's escort, as they would have sought for her beyond the [[Iant Iaur]].<ref name=\"Maeglin\">{{WJ|Maeglin}}</ref>{{rp|328}}\n\n===A note from ''[[The Nature of Middle-earth]]''===\nIn a very late note dated c. 1972-3, Tolkien seemed to imply that Ecthelion and [[Egalmoth]] were of royal lineage, since some [[Steward of Gondor|Ruling Stewards]] of [[Gondor]] were named after \"''renowned heroes in the '''royal lines of old'''''\".<ref>{{NM|P2v}}, footnote, p. 189</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{gondolin}}\n\n{{HousesofGondolin}}\n\n[[Category:Battle cries]]\n[[Category:Calaquendi]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:Gnomish names]]\n[[Category:Gondolindrim]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Noldor]]\n[[Category:Noldorin names]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]] \n\n[[de:Ecthelion (Hauptmann von Gondolin)]]\n[[fr:encyclo:personnages:elfes:noldor:ecthelion]]\n[[fi:Ecthelion (Gondolin)]]"}}}
