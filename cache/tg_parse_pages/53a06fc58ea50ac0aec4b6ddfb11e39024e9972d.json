When [[Eriol]] was playing with the people of the house at the [[Hall of Play Recovered]], they felt tired and sat beside the fire. \nThen Vëannë climbed on Eriol's knee and asked him to recount about Men and their children in Great Lands (\"''...didst thou have a garden there such as we?''\"). He told her about his life and battles he had seen, and Vëannë concluded that wars are terrible. Then Eriol asked the children to tell some tale they had heard instead, and she volunteered to tell the \"[[Tale of Tinúviel]]\".<ref name=Tinuviel>{{LT2|I}}</ref>{{rp|4–8}}\n\nBefore beginning the tale, she argued with [[Ausir (boy)|Ausir]], who suggested [[Qenya|Elvish]] names ''[[Thingol|Tinwë Linto]]'' and ''[[Melian|Wendelin]]'' instead of [[Gnomish]] ''[[Thingol|Tinwelint]]'' and ''[[Melian|Gwendeling]]''. But she claimed that much earlier, when she was on the [[Path of Dreams]], she saw Gwendeling and [[Luthien|Tinúviel]]. She started the story describing Gwendeling.<ref name=Tinuviel/>{{rp|8}} After she finished the tale describing the death of [[Beren]], Eriol said that such a sad story heard from the mouth of a beautiful maiden calls for compassion. She wept and said that she does not remember what was later. Other children, including Ausir, helped her say that Beren and Tinúviel returned to life, but as mortals. Then Eriol said that he was not expecting such a story from little maidens of [[Cottage of Lost Play|Mar Vanwa Tyaliéva]]. She answered that she learned it by heart from books but does not understand it fully.<ref name=Tinuviel/>{{rp|40–41}}\n\n==Etymology==\n''Vëannë'' is clearly [[Qenya]], but it is never glossed. During their conversation, Eriol gave her the name '''''Melinir''''' (while she named him ''Melinon''),<ref name=Tinuviel/>{{rp|5}} which is clearly derived from ''mel-'' (\"love\").<ref>{{LT2|Appendix}}, entry \"Melian\"</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Veanne}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Elves]]\n[[Category:Qenya names]]"}}}
