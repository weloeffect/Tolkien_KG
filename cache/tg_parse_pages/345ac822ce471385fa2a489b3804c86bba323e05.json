Old Maggot still remembered it when Frodo came to his [[Bamfurlong|farm]] years later, and as a parting gift, [[Mrs. Maggot]] gave Frodo a basket of the prized mushrooms.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{HM|FR}}, \"[[A Short Cut to Mushrooms]]\"</ref> \n\n==Inspiration==\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] described himself as a Hobbit in all but size, noting that he was very fond of mushrooms.<ref name=\"L213\">{{L|213}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn a note discussing the [[Drúedain]], Tolkien made mention about the fungi in the [[First Age]]: they were generally considered ugly and dangerous by the [[Elves]] and most of the [[Edain]], and the less wise called them \"ork-plants\", believing them cursed and  blighted by [[Morgoth]]. The Eldar did not eat them and only a few Edain knew how to distinguish the edible ones and could eat them because of great hunger when lost in the wild. The Drúedain had a lore of plants and ate fungi with pleasure (to the astonishment of the other peoples), and they cultured their favorite ones. They passed this knowledge to the [[Haladin]] who ate them when guests out of courtesy, and resolved to them at need. Tolkien later discarded the note believing that this trait made the Drúedain \"too like Hobbits\".<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, n. 52</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Mushrooms in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring - Pippin spotting mushrooms.jpg|[[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] spotting mushrooms - ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''\nFile:The Hobbit (2003) Balfor Baruk-Khazâd.JPG|Mushrooms in [[Goblin-town]] - [[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|''The Hobbit'' (2003 video game)]].\n</gallery>\n'''1984-1997: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]''''' \n:The various books released for the game describe [[Mushrooms in Middle-earth Role Playing|many different kinds of mushrooms]].\n\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''\n:Though the scenes in Maggot's house have been omitted, a nod to mushrooms is given when the four Hobbits escape Farmer Maggot.
