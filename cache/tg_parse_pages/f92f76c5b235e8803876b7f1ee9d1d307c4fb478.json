As such, the anthology also reflects the growing bonds between two national communities of scholars, who over the past decade have consolidated research on Tolkien's legendarium at various large universities on the Iberian peninsula.}}\n\n==External links==\n\n* [http://www.walking-tree.org/books/nole_hyarmenillo.php Official product page]\n* [https://scholar.valpo.edu/journaloftolkienresearch/vol15/iss2/10/ Review by Marjorie Burns in ''Journal of Tolkien Research'']\n* [https://dc.swosu.edu/mythlore/vol42/iss1/27/ Review by Nancy Martsch in ''Mythlore'']\n* [http://journal.finfar.org/articles/book-review-nole-hyarmenillo/ Review by José Manuel Ferrández Bru in ''Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research'']\n\n{{Cormarë}}\n{{title|italics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nole Hyarmenillo}}\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]"}}}
