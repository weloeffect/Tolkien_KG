After a short distance at the [[Rushock Bog]] it split into two branches, which soon rejoined and then turned eastwards, southwards and again eastwards before [[Hobbiton]].<ref name=Part/> Before flowing through Hobbiton the Water was quite narrow and could be crossed by a narrow plank bridge, and was shadowed by alder-trees.<ref>{{FR|Three}}, p. 71</ref> From there, it flowed through Hobbiton and on into the [[Bywater Pool]] at [[Bywater]], where it was joined by a stream from the north. From then on, it flowed eastward alongside the [[East Road]], which ran through the [[Water-valley]].<ref>{{FR|Three}}, p. 71 and p. 77</ref> North of [[Frogmorton]] it split again into two branches that rejoined after a short distance. It continued eastwards where it could be crossed at the Budge Ford by the village of [[Budgeford]]<ref>{{HM|UI}}, entry Budgeford, p. 119</ref> and then continued eastwards to join the [[Baranduin|Brandywine]] just north of the [[Brandywine Bridge]].<ref name=Part/>\n\n==Inspiration==\nThe naming of the Water may be a parody of some sorts of Celtic hydronyms that mean simply \"river\" or \"water\".<ref>[[Mark T.
