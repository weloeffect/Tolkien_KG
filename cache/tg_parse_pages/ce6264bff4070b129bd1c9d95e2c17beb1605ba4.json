In [[Eriador]] they met [[Elves]] and the dwindling [[Dúnedain of Arnor]] and they adopted [[Westron]] and [[tengwar|writing]]. But they kept a few peculiar words and names from old.<ref name=concerning>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>\n\nA small number of [[Stoors]] moved briefly to the [[Angle of Eriador]],<ref>{{App|B2}}, entry for the year [[Third Age 1150|1150]]</ref> where they had some contact with the [[Dunlendings]], picking up a few [[Dunlendish]] words. When the Stoors later moved to the [[Shire]] with the rest of their kin, they quickly adopted the language as spoken in the Shire at the time, but some influences remained, primarily with personal and place names and their words for months and season.<ref name=fhobbits>{{App|Hobbits}}</ref>\n\nAlthough they had adopted and adapted the [[King's Reckoning]] (see: [[Shire Calendar]]) they kept their own names of months and weekdays.<ref name=concerning/> The ''[[Yellowskin]]'' book contained entries dating back to around {{TA|2000}}, and was the oldest record of Hobbitish. There, the day names such as ''Sterrendei'' and ''Sunnendei'' (later [[Sterday]] and [[Sunday]]) and so on, were recorded.<ref name=cal>{{App|Calendars}}</ref>\n\nIn any case, by the time of the [[War of the Ring]], the [[Rohanese]] language and Hobbitish possessed many linguistic similarities which were obvious even to a non-linguist like [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]]; because of their [[Northern Mannish]] background from the Vales of Anduin, Hobbitish retained some archaic elements that didn't exist in Westron. Simply hearing parts of the language of the Rohirrim, Merry noticed several words which clearly sounded like old words used in the Shire.<ref name=records>{{FR|Records}}</ref>\n\nMerry would in his later years author a book of linguistic study on the relationship, \"''[[Old Words and Names in the Shire]]''\".<ref name=records/>\n\n==Grammatical differences==\nHobbitish was a regional dialect spoken in a rustic agricultural region. As such, it was not as \"refined\" as the true form of the language as spoken eg. in [[Gondor]] or [[Rivendell]].<ref name=f2/> More learned Hobbits tended to speak more formal speech.<ref name=f2/>\n===Familiar pronoun===\nHobbit society was made up almost entirely of farmers and with barely any \"government\" to speak of, much less a noble class.<ref>{{FR|Ordering}}</ref> As a result, Hobbitish possesses only the \"familiar\" pronoun of Westron but not the [[wikipedia:T-V distinction|deferential pronoun]]; except in scattered parts of the [[Westfarthing]] where it was used more as a light-hearted term of endearment.<ref name=f2/>\n\nThis prominent peculiarity in actual grammatical structure and accent is what [[Gondorians]] and [[Rohirrim]] are referring to when they repeatedly remark that Hobbit-speech sounds strange.<ref>{{RK|MT}}, p. 762</ref><ref name=road557>{{TT|Road}}, p. 557</ref>\n\nIt was most obvious when [[Peregrin Took]] was speaking to [[Denethor|Denethor II]], [[Steward]] and ruler of Gondor, while he was at court in [[Minas Tirith]]; unintentionally, Pippin was addressing Denethor using the very informal and personalized familiar language, as with a close friend or social equal. Denethor seemed to react with some bemusement but this astonished his servants, and probably gave strength to the rumor that Pippin was of very high social rank within his own country, the \"[[Ernil i Pheriannath]]\".<ref name=f2/>\n\n==Other names==\nPersonal names of Hobbit individuals are varied. Some of them are Hobbitish but many are archaic with forgotten meaning.<ref name=fhobbits/>\n\nPeasants and tradesmen like the [[Gamgee]]s or the [[Hornblower]]s used short archaic names, akin to that of the [[Éothéod]] (cf. [[Fastred of Greenholm|Fastred]], [[Erling]]).{{Fact}}\n\nMembers of old aristocratic families such as the [[Took]]s and the [[Bolger]]s, had names taken mostly from legends of the past.<ref name=f2/> They often had names which referred to weapons, battles and bravery (cf. [[Isengar Took|Isengar]], [[Hildifons Took|Hildifons]]).\n\n[[Bucklanders]] such as the [[Brandybuck]]s wore peculiar names apparently derived from the former southern [[Stoorish]].<ref name=f2/>\n\nHobbit women also wore names of flowers and jewels. Notably, noble Took and Brandybuck women had names of exotic and mythical plants (cf. [[Amaranth Brandybuck|Amaranth]], [[Belladonna Took|Belladonna]]), compared to ordinary names of the Bagginses or Gamgees ([[Marigold Gamgee|Marigold]], [[Poppy Chubb-Baggins|Poppy]]). Jewel names were peculiar to higher class, such as the Tooks, or women marrying into the Took family, and then Boffins, Bolgers and Gardners ([[Adamanta Took|Adamanta]], [[Berylla Boffin|Berylla]], [[Ruby Bolger|Ruby]]).<ref name=f2/>\n\nThe most common names were worn by the middle class, such as the [[Baggins]]es of the late Third Age; they were short and meaningless, perhaps derived from the above legendary names. Male names ended in -o while females ended in -a or -e.<ref name=f2/>\n\n==Vocabulary peculiarities==\nThe major difference between Hobbitish and more proper forms of Westron are many archaic words that Hobbits retained in their vocabulary from whatever languages they spoke in ancient times. Examples would include:\n<!--Definitions in this section are accurate but I'm struggling to find a source to prove they are retained archaic Westron, several seem to be just Hobbitish-->\n*''[[Hobbits|Hobbit]]'' (''[[kuduk]]'') - the word Hobbits called themselves. It is thought to derive from the name the [[Northmen]] gave to them in the [[Vales of Anduin]], the Rohirric \"[[Holbytla]]\" (pl. \"Holbytlan\"), which translates into Westron as \"hole-builder\", due to their habit of living in holes dug into hillsides.<ref name=f2/>\n*''[[Smial]]'' (''[[trân]]'') - \"large excavated hole used as a home\" (i.e. [[Bag End]], [[Brandy Hall]], or [[Great Smials]] of the Tooks).<ref name=records/>  \n*''[[Mathom]]'' (''[[kast]]'') - \"old thing which you no longer have a use for but don't want to throw away; a knick-nack; an antique\" (i.e. the [[Mathom-house]] is a museum)<ref name=f2/>\n*''[[Thain]]'' - the title of the ruler of the Shire after the loss of [[Arvedui]]{{fact}}\n*''[[Withywindle]]'' - river name, peculiar to the language of the Shire.<ref name=\"Nomen\">{{HM|N}}, p. 779</ref>\n*''[[Swertings]]'' - a word referring to the [[Swarthy Men]].{{fact}}\n*''[[Oliphaunts]]'' - archaic name of the gigantic beasts, also known as [[Mûmakil]].{{Fact}}\n*''Goblin'' - the evil race properly termed \"[[Orcs]]\" in Common Speech were referred to as \"''Goblins''\" by the Hobbits. This is apparently some local colloquialism of uncertain origin. However, while this originated as a Hobbit \"slang term\" for Orcs, due to the presence of the Shire on the major trade route of the East Road, over the centuries this term was actually picked up by members of other races (much as how smoking [[Pipe-weed]] was).{{Fact}} The term actually gained a high degree of popularity throughout Middle-earth.  \n\nThe highest concentration of unique \"Hobbitish\" words are of course in the surnames of old families, place names, and calendar words such as names for months, days, seasons, et cetera.<ref name=fhobbits/>\n\n==Real-world background== \n\"Westron\" as it appears in the books written by J.R.R. Tolkien functions under the conceit that \"Common Speech\" is really a separate foreign language which Tolkien \"translated\" into English. For example, the name \"Meriadoc Brandybuck\" is \"translated\" into English from the \"genuine Westron\" name ''[[Kalimac]] [[Brandagamba]]'' (which would make it, actually \"genuine Hobbitish\")<ref name=f2/>\n\nIn order to mirror the peculiar and rustic dialect of Hobbits, Tolkien invented new likely words by \"modernizing\" obsolete archaic [[Old English]] ones;<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 198, entry \"Hobbitish\"</ref> such examples are [[Thain]] from ''þegn'', [[mathom]] from ''māþum'' and [[smial]] from ''smygel''.<ref name=f2/>\n\nThe most obvious linguistic parallel between the \"Hobbitish\" dialect and language of the Rohirrim is in the name \"Hobbit\" itself:  according to [[Théoden]] of Rohan, there are a few legends among the Rohirrim about Hobbit-like creatures that they call the ''[[Holbytlan]]'' in [[Rohanese]].<ref name=road557/> Rohanese is actually \"translated\" into Old English in the books just as Westron is into English, because it is an archaic form of Westron.<ref>{{L|144}}</ref> \"Holbytlan\" in Old English means \"Hole-builders\", an apt name for the Hobbits. However, in \"genuine Westron\", the word translated into English as \"Hobbit\", is actually \"''[[Kuduk]]''\".  The corresponding \"genuine Rohirric\" word from which it evolved is \"''[[Kûd-dûkan]]''\".<ref name=f2/>\n===Parallels===\nAs Tolkien did with the Mannish languages which he rendered with Germanic names, various regional Hobbitish names are usually rendered with variant forms.\n*[[Westron]] = Modern English.<ref>{{App|E1}}</ref>\n*\"Middle Westron\" (of the [[Yellowskin|Yellowskin Book]]) = Middle English\n*\"Old Marish-hobbitish\" = (Old) Welsh.\n*[[Fallohides|Fallohide]] names = [[Wikipedia:Frankish language|Frankish]] and [[Celtic]].<ref name=f2/>\n*\"[[Bree-dialect]]\" = Eastern Brythonic (the variety of the British [[Celtic]] language spoken in Logria, before it became \"England\").\n*\"[[Bucklandish]]\" = Celtic influence, due to the high concentration of Stoor-Hobbit blood. The Stoors used to live near the [[Dunlendings]] and had some linguistic influence from them.<ref name=f2/>\n\nA few hobbit names of Elvish origin are translated as Latin or Frenchified Latin names, such as [[Gerontius Took]], [[Paladin Took II|Paladin Took]], and [[Peregrin Took]].<ref>[[Jim Allan]] (ed.), ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', \"Giving of Names\"</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''1955: ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1956 radio series)|BBC Radio's The Lord of the Rings]]'':'''\n:Adapter [[Terence Tiller]] briefly corresponded with Tolkien about what accents should be used.<ref>{{L|193}}</ref> It is unknown if he followed Tolkien's advice.\n\n'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''\n:There seems to be little contrast in style, other than the rural portrayal of [[Samwise Gamgee]].\n\n'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''\n:Any dialectical difference is completely removed. Sam speaks the same English as the other Hobbits.\n\n'''1992: ''[[Tales from the Perilous Realm (1992 radio series)|BBC Radio's Tales from the Perilous Realm]]'':'''\n:In the two episodes of \"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil\", [[Jonathan Adams]]' portrayal of Sam Gamgee is close to over-the-top rustic. He speaks in a grumbling, low voice.\n\n'''2001: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''\n: Considerable attention was paid to the dialects characters speak with and cast members trained extensively with dialogue coaches. Of the main Hobbit characters:\n*Sam Gamgee speaks with the working-class rustic West Country accent which was used as the standard for all the other minor Hobbit characters.  \n*[[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] and [[Frodo Baggins]], because they are both book-educated, speak with a slightly more refined and less pronounced accent.  \n*The actor who played [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], [[Billy Boyd]], is Scottish, and originally he was supposed to speak like the others, but eventually it was decided that it was adversely affecting his comic timing. The production team then invented the [[wikipedia:Canon (fiction)#Nature of fictional canons|justification]] that the [[Took Family|Took]] region of the Shire is described as very hilly, so much so that when [[Saruman]]'s [[ruffians]] take over the rest of the Shire they are successfully repulsed from Took-land due to its rough terrain, and thus is it loosely analogous to Scotland. Thus, it was decided that Tooks should speak with a Scottish accent as well, and Boyd was allowed to use his normal Scottish accent when portraying Pippin for the entire trilogy of films.\n*Meriadoc Brandybuck is described as being the linguistic \"oddball\" of the group: he was not from any of the four farthings of the Shire, but a Brandybuck from Buckland, and thus is from a region apart. To reflect this, his accent is noticeably distinct from the other Hobbits seen on-screen, something of an invention between actor [[Dominic Monaghan]] and the dialect coaches, to reflect his unique origin.\n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Hobbitish words|Category: Hobbitish words]]\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{languages}}\n[[Category:Hobbitish| ]]\n[[de:Hobbitisch]]"}}}
