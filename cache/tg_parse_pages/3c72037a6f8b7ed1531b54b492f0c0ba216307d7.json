Tolkien}}\n'''Sigelwara Land''' is the title of an essay by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], in which is examined the etymology of ''Sigelwaran'' (and the more usual form ''Sigelhearwan'') — the [[Old English]] word for [[Wikipedia:Ethiopia|Ethiopians]].<ref name=CG>{{CG|RG}}, pp. 889-90</ref><ref name=TB1>[http://www.tolkienbooks.net/php/details.php?reference=13590 Medium Aevum. 1932], [http://www.tolkienbooks.net/php/details.php?reference=13710 Medium Aevum. 1934], at [http://www.tolkienbooks.net/ TolkienBooks.net] (accessed 2 February 2013)</ref>\n\n==Contents==\n\nTolkien discusses the elements of the word ''Sigelhearwan'' and related forms, as found in Old English manuscripts. ''Sigel'' can mean both \"sun\" and \"jewel\", and while the meaning of ''hearwa'' is unknown, he suggests that it is connected to devils and blackness.<ref name=CG/> Tolkien writes that his tentative analysis shows that: \n\n{{Blockquote|[g]limpses are caught, if dim and confused, of the background of English and northern tradition and imagination [...] ''Sigel'' may be taken as a symbol of the intricate blending of the [[Latin]] and Northern which makes the study of Old English peculiarly interesting and controversial.|[[J.R.R.

[[Haradwaith]] has the anglicized name ''(Sun)Harrowland''.<ref>{{TI|Fangorn}}, Note 4</ref>\n\n[[Tom Shippey]] has suggested that Tolkien's discussion of ''Sigelhearwan'' \"helped to naturalise the '[[Balrogs|Balrog]]' in the traditions of the North, and [...] to create (or corroborate) the image of the ''[[silmarils|silmaril]]'', that fusion of 'sun' and 'jewel' in physical form\".<ref>[[Tom Shippey]], ''[[The Road to Middle-earth]]'', p. 39 (1992, 2nd edn.)</ref> (In [[Aelfwine]]'s [[Old English]] translations, the name ''[[Silmaril]]'' is rendered phonetically as ''Sigelmaerels'' containing ''sigel'' = sun, jewel).<ref>{{SM|QA1}}, p. 209</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\n\nThe essay was originally published in two parts: part one appeared in [[Medium Ævum (Vol. 1, No. 3)|''Medium Ævum'' (Vol. 1, No. 3)]] in [[1932]], and part two appeared in [[Medium Ævum (Vol. 3, No. 2)|''Medium Ævum'' (Vol. 3, No. 2)]] in [[1934]].<ref name=CG/><ref name=TB1/> Both parts of the essay also appeared as separate offprints.<ref>[http://www.tolkienbooks.net/php/details.php?reference=13600 Sigelwara land - I. 1932], [http://www.tolkienbooks.net/php/details.php?reference=13720 Sigelwara land - II. 1934], at [http://www.tolkienbooks.net/ TolkienBooks.net] (accessed 2 February 2013)</ref>\n\n==External links==\n*{{WP|Sigelwara Land}}\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Published articles by J.R.R.
