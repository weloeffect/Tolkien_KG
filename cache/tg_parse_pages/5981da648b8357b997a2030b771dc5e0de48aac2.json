Tolkien]], edited by [[Christopher Tolkien]] as a single book, published on [[1 June]] [[2017]]. It contains the various versions of the story previously published throughout the volumes of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''. \n\nThe common plot is the story of the love and adventures of the mortal [[Men|Man]] [[Beren]] and the immortal [[Elf]]-maiden [[Lúthien]], and how they stole a [[Silmaril]] from the [[Dark Lord]] [[Morgoth]]'s crown.\n\nTolkien wrote several versions of their story, the latest published in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', although the tale is also mentioned in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n\nThe story is one of three \"[[Atanatárion|great tales]]\" set in the [[First Age]] of Tolkien's [[Middle-earth]], the other two being ''[[The Children of Húrin]]'' and ''[[The Fall of Gondolin]]''.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe tale of Beren and Lúthien was, or became, an essential element in the evolution of the mythology of ancient [[Arda]] (the Creation through the [[First Age]]) conceived by J.R.R. Tolkien, which were published as ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. Returning from France and the battle of the Somme at the end of 1916, he wrote the tale in the following year.\n\nEssential to the story, and never changed, is the fate that shadowed the love of Beren and Lúthien: for Beren was a mortal man, but Lúthien was an immortal elf. Her father, a great elvish lord, in deep opposition to Beren, imposed on him an impossible task that he must perform before he might wed Lúthien. This is the kernel of the legend; and it leads to the supremely heroic attempt of Beren and Lúthien together to rob the greatest of all evil beings, Melkor, called ''Morgoth'', the Black Enemy, of a Silmaril. \n\nIn this book Christopher Tolkien has attempted to extract the story of Beren and Lúthien from the comprehensive work in which it was embedded; but that story was itself changing as it developed new associations within the larger history. To show something of the process whereby this legend of Middle-earth evolved over the years, he has told the story in his father's own words by giving, first, its original form, and then passages in prose and verse from later texts that illustrate the narrative as it changed. Presented together for the first time, they reveal aspects of the story, both in event and in narrative immediacy, that were afterwards lost. \n\n==Contents==\n* Preface\n* Notes on the Elder Days\n\n* '''Beren and Lúthien'''\n:{|\n|◦ ''[[The Tale of Tinúviel]]'' || [''[[The Book of Lost Tales: Part Two|LT II]]'', [[The Tale of Tinúviel|ch. 1]]]\n|-\n|◦ A Passage from the '[[Sketch of the Mythology]]' || [''[[The Shaping of Middle-earth|Shaping]]'', [[The Earliest 'Silmarillion'|ch. 2]]]\n|-\n|◦ A Passage Extracted from ''[[The Lay of Leithian]]'' || [''[[The Lays of Beleriand|Lays]]'', [[The Lay of Leithian|ch. 3]], [[Lay of Leithian Canto II|canto II]]]\n|-\n|◦ The ''[[The Quenta#Qenta Noldorinwa|Quenta Noldorinwa]]'' || [''[[The Shaping of Middle-earth|Shaping]]'', [[The Quenta|ch. 3]]]\n|-\n|◦ A Passage Extracted from the ''Quenta'' || [''[[The Shaping of Middle-earth|Shaping]]'', [[The Quenta|ch. 3]], §9]\n|-\n|◦ A Second Extract from ''The Lay of Leithian'' || [''[[The Lays of Beleriand|Lays]]'', [[The Lay of Leithian|ch. 3]], [[Lay of Leithian Canto VI|cantos VI]]-[[Lay of Leithian Canto VII|VII]]]\n|-\n|◦ A Further Extract from the ''Quenta'' || [''[[The Shaping of Middle-earth|Shaping]]'', [[The Quenta|ch. 3]], §10]\n|-\n|◦ The Narrative of ''The Lay of Leithian'' to Its Termination || [''[[The Lays of Beleriand|Lays]]'', [[The Lay of Leithian|ch. 3]], [[Lay of Leithian Canto VIII|cantos VIII]]-[[Lay of Leithian Canto XIV|XIV]]]\n|-\n|◦ The ''[[Quenta Silmarillion (Lost Road)|Quenta Silmarillion]]'' || [''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings|Lost Road]]'', pt. 2, [[Quenta Silmarillion (Lost Road)|ch. 6]]]\n|-\n|◦ The Return of Beren and Lúthien According to the ''Quenta Noldorinwa'' || [''[[The Shaping of Middle-earth|Shaping]]'', [[The Quenta|ch. 3]], §14]\n|-\n|◦ Extract from the ''[[The Book of Lost Tales|Lost Tale]]'' of [[the Nauglafring]] || [''[[The Book of Lost Tales: Part Two|LT II]]'', [[The Nauglafring|ch. 4]]]\n|-\n|◦ The Morning and Evening Star || [''[[The Silmarillion|S]]'', [[Of the Voyage of Eärendil and the War of Wrath|ch. 24]]]\n|-\n|◦ Appendix: Revisions to ''The Lay of Leithian'' || [''[[The Lays of Beleriand|Lays]]'', [[The Lay of Leithian Recommenced|ch. 4]]]\n|}\n* List of Names\n* Glossary\n\n==Conception and development==\nThe first iteration of the tale of Beren and Lúthien was written in late [[1917]]<ref name=UnnamedIntro>{{BL|Introduction}}</ref> and was one of the first tales written by J.R.R. Tolkien which would form part of his [[legendarium]]. Tolkien later erased this original draft and wrote over it; the resultant text constitutes the earliest surviving copy of the tale, and was named \"[[The Tale of Tinúviel]]\".<ref name=UnnamedIntro/><ref>{{LT2|In}}</ref> There are a number of differences present in this early text when compared to the tale in the published version of ''The Silmarillion''. Notably, Beren is an [[Elf]], the character of [[Felagund]] is not present, and there is no mention of [[Nargothrond]]. This version includes a narrative predecessor to [[Sauron]]: [[Tevildo|Tevildo, Prince of Cats]]. \n\nIn [[1926]], the tale was incorporated into the earliest known version of what would become The Silmarillion, namely, the [[Sketch of the Mythology]], by Tolkien. This was written as a brief synopsis of events, and would be the first in a line of directly evolving texts that would culminate in the final, published version of The Silmarillion. A notable alteration from the Tale of Tinúviel is that Tolkien had changed Beren to be a [[Men|man]].<ref name=Sketch>{{BL|Sketch}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, Tolkien composed ''[[The Lay of Leithian]]'' (from [[1925]]<ref>{{BL| Passage}}</ref> to [[1931]]<ref name=LBLeithian_pp150To151>{{LB|Leithian}}, pp. 150-151</ref>), a poem telling the tale of Beren and Lúthien, which was refined to include the characters [[Felagund]], [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]], and the Necromancer [[Thû]], the ''direct'' predecessor to the character [[Sauron]]. Tolkien abandoned the Lay before its completion.<ref name=LBLeithian_pp150To151/> Nonetheless, it is still an extensive piece of work, standing at over 4,000 lines long.<ref>Power, Rebecca. \"Tolkien's Penchant for Alliteration: Using XML to Analyze ''The Lay of Leithian''.\" ''Journal of Tolkien Research'' 11.1 (2020): 7.</ref>\n\nSubsequent to the Sketch of the Mythology, the ''[[Quenta Noldorinwa]]'' was written in [[1930]]. This was \"the only complete and finished version of ''The Silmarillion''\" Tolkien wrote.<ref>{{BL|Quenta}}</ref> As in the ''Lay of Leithian'', the character of Felagund is present in the story of Beren and Lúthien. The next main iteration in development of the tale was also the final version, as found in the ''[[Quenta Silmarillion (Lost Road)|Quenta Silmarillion]]''.\n\n==Publication history and gallery==\n;UK editions\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"125px\" heights=\"125px\">\nFile:Beren and Lúthien 2017.png|2017 hardcover\nFile:Beren and Lúthien 2017 deluxe.png|2017 hardcover deluxe edition\nFile:Beren and Lúthien 2017 large.png|2017 paperback large print\nFile:Beren and Lúthien 2018.png|2018 paperback \nFile:Beren and Lúthien 2022.jpeg|2022 paperback\nFile:Beren and Lúthien 2023.jpg|2023 paperback\nFile:Beren and Lúthien 2017.png|2025 hardcover (boxed set)\n</gallery>\n*[[HarperCollins]] hardcover ([[2017]]), pp.&nbsp;288.
