Ever since they claimed [[Harondor|South Gondor]].<ref name=\"Gondor\">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>\n\nThey allied with the [[Haradrim]] against Gondor; in {{TA|1540}} King [[Aldamir]] was slain during that war.<ref name=\"ta\">{{App|TA}}</ref>\n\n[[Angamaite]] and [[Sangahyando]], the descendants of Castamir, led the Corsairs to ravage [[Pelargir]], killing King [[Minardil]] who was there ({{TA|1634}}). In the following years, Gondor suffered by the [[Great Plague]] and Corsairs raided the Gondorian [[Outlands|coasts]] up to [[Anfalas]], until [[Umbardacil]] avenged Minardil's death, slew the last descendants of Castamir, drove away the Corsairs and retook Umbar ({{TA|1810}}).<ref name=\"Gondor\" /><ref name=\"ta\" /> \n\nEventually, Umbar was taken by the [[Haradrim]].<ref name=\"Gondor\" />\n\nDuring the reign of Steward Cirion ({{TA|2489}}-{{TA|2567|n}}),<ref>{{App|South}}, ''Ruling Stewards'', year after Boromir and year after Cirion, p. 1039</ref> the Corsairs of Umbar attacked the coasts of Gondor.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, ''The Stewards'', p. 1053</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|2746}}, the Corsairs were involved in a conflict with the fifteenth [[Princes of Dol Amroth|Prince of Dol Amroth]] and killed him.<ref name=\"Elendil\">{{PM|Elendil}}, ''The House of Dol Amroth'', entry for the 15th prince of Dol Amroth, p. 221</ref>\n\nThe Corsairs took a long time to prepare a great fleet. In {{TA|2758}} three fleets sailed from Umbar and [[Harad]] and landed at many places along the coasts of Gondor and even at the mouth of the river [[Isen]]<ref name=\"Beren\">{{App|Stewards}}, ''The Stewards'', entries about Steward Beren and Steward Beregond, p. 1054</ref> and in the mouth of the river [[Lefnui]].<ref name=\"Helm\">{{App|Eorl}}, entries about King Helm, p. 1066</ref> The troops from Umbar and Harad supported the Dunlendings who were led by Wulf to invade Rohan from the west over the river Isen and down from Isengard.<ref name=\"Helm\" /> Before the spring of {{TA|2759|n}}, [[Beregond (Steward of Gondor)|Beregond]] defeated the Corsairs of Umbar and the Men of Harad that had invaded Gondor and subsequently sent troops to Rohan to help the Rohirrim to defeat the invaders.<ref name=\"Beren\" /> As a result the Dunleandings were driven from Rohan and from Isengard.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}, entries about King Fréaláf, p. 1067</ref> \n\nIn the time of [[Ecthelion II]], a man under his service known as [[Thorongil]], warned him that the Corsairs were a great peril for the [[Southern Fiefs]]. With a small fleet, Thorongil made a [[Surprise Attack on Umbar|surprise attack]], burning a great part of their ships and overthrowing the [[Captain of the Haven]].<ref name=\"Stewards\">{{App|Stewards}}, ''The Stewards'', entries about Steward Ecthelion II, p. 1055</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], a fleet of Corsairs was raiding [[Lebennin]] when [[Aragorn]] captured their ships<ref>{{RK|Debate}}</ref> and rowed them to [[Minas Tirith]] to relieve the siege of the city.<ref name=\"pelennor\">{{RK|Battle}}</ref>\n\nIt is possible that the threat posed by the Corsairs of Umbar to the coastlands of Gondor and to sea traffic was completely subdued during the reign of King Elessar<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entries about the reign of King Eldacar, p. 1047</ref> in a war between the forces of Gondor led by King Elessar supported by the cavalry of the Rohan led by King Éomer on the distant fields of the South.<ref>{{App|Mark}}, ''Third Line'', last paragraph, p. 1071</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nThe corsairs's fleet included [[Wikipedia:Dromon|dromunds]], and ships with deep hulls and many oars and with black sails.<ref name=\"pelennor\" /> Others were recognizable by their red sails, adorned with a black star or eye.<ref>{{webcite|website=TS|articleurl=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/2015/11/tolkiens-annotated-map-of-middle-earth-transcribed|articlename=Tolkien’s annotated map of Middle-earth transcribed|dated=10 November 2015|accessed=11 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the course of the [[Third Age]] Westron had become the native language of nearly all [[Men]] that lived within the borders of the old kingdom of [[Gondor]], including all along the coasts from Umbar northward and inland as far as the [[Ephel Dúath]]. At the time of the [[War of the Ring]] Westron was still the native tongue in this area.<ref name=\"F1\">{{App|Languages}}, first and second paragraph, p. 1127</ref><ref>{{PM|Atani}}, penultimate paragraph and its preceeding paragraph</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] described in his [[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings|notes for the translation of names in ''The Lord of the Rings'' into other languages]] that the Corsairs \"are imagined as similar to the Mediterranean corsairs: sea-robbers with fortified bases\".<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 755</ref>\n\nJohn Bowers suggests that the Corsairs of Umbar were inspired by the [[Wikipedia:Barbary Pirates|Pirates of the Barbary Coast]].<ref>[[John M. Bowers]], ''[[Tolkien's Lost Chaucer]]'' ([[2019]]), p. 170</ref> These pirates included the [[Wikipedia:Salé Rovers|pirates]] of [[Wikipedia:Republic of Salé|Salé]] in [[Wikipedia:Morocco|Morocco]]. In the 17th century thousands of muslims or former muslims fled from Spain to Salé where they established a republic that engaged in piracy and made raids in Spain and even on the coasts of England where they took members of the popluation with them as slaves.\n\nMyriam Librán-Moreno seems to see parallels between the Corsairs of Umbar and the conquest of Crete by the Arabs in A.D. 824, who established an emirate there with Crete becoming a center of Arab pirates in the Mediterranean that caused hardships for the Byzantine Empire.<ref>Myriam Librán-Moreno, Byzantium, New Rome! in Jason Fisher (editor), Tolkien and the Study of his Sources, McFarland & Company, Inc., 2011, p. 105</ref>\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien wrote on [[General Map of Middle-earth|his son's map of Middle-earth]] for [[Pauline Baynes]] that Umbar and the City of the Corsairs are approximately at the latitude of [[Wikipedia:Cyprus|Cyprus]] and that [[Minas Tirith]] is approximately at the latitude of [[Wikipedia:Ravenna|Ravenna]], but more to the east near [[Wikipedia:Belgrade|Belgrade]]. He wrote that these references are so that Pauline Baynes can roughly judge the climate and the fauna and flora for her [[A Map of Middle-earth|map of Middle-earth]]. In addition, he wrote in a [[Letter 294|letter to Charlotte and Denis Plimmer]] that the city of [[Pelargir]] is approximately at the latitude of ancient [[Wikipedia:Troy|Troy]]. Cyprus is approximately on the same latidue as [[Wikipedia:Carthage|Carthage]], an ancient city in northern Africa at the Mediterranean Sea and a historic enemy of the [[Wikipedia:Roman Empire|Roman Empire]], and as [[Wikipedia:Tangier|Tangier]], an ancient city in northwest Africa at the southern entrance to the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''\n:Corsairs are from the [[Mordor]] faction, and are equipped with knives and fire-bombs.\n\n'''2014: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Corsairs were led by four brothers who falsely call themselves the Heirs of [[Castamir]]. These were Azruthor, Dolgimil, Azgarzôr, and the eldest Balakhôr the Scourge. The player negotiated with a Corsair named Jajax, who ended up siding with the player against the Heirs and their followers.\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Black Númenóreans]]\n[[Category:Haradrim]]\n[[Category:Men]]\n[[Category:Servants of Sauron]]\n[[de:Korsaren]]\n[[fi:Umbarin Merirosvot]]"}}}
