Due to the king's anger at Aldarion's long absences from the realm they did not discuss the letter when it was delivered.  Later though the king did read the document. Upon the outside it stated that it had been given in Mithlond to the King's Heir and was to be delivered in person.\n\nWithin, the letter opened with a greetings to the king. Gil-galad then thanked the king for sending his son to him so many times and asked for his pardon for detaining him at times for his knowledge and counsel. The Elvish king then imparted information only for the Númenórean king's eyes. A new shadow was arising in the East which Gil-galad declared was a servant of [[Morgoth]]. This power was gaining strength and he asked Meneldur for help. Gil-galad stated that it was Aldarion's wise counsel that the [[Eldar]] and the men of Númenor should seek to hold the westlands together. [[Eriador]] was identified as the core holding to be maintained. The [[Gap of Rohan|gap]] in the [[Misty Mountains]] in the land of [[Calenardhon]] was a defensive weak point that required a seat of power nearby. Gil-galad praised Aldarion for his establishment of [[Vinyalondë]] at the mouth of the [[Gwathló]] but stated that it needed men. Gil-galad then appealed to the ancient friendship of the Eldar and the [[Dúnedain]] to withstand the new threat.\n\nMeneldur was sorely troubled by this letter, both for its contents and because of his estrangement from his son which had kept their minds apart. Pondering whether or not to give aid, Meneldur decided that it would be best to pass the [[Sceptre of Númenor]] to his son, whose knowledge of the situation was greater than his own. The [[Council of the Sceptre]] sought to delay the king's passing of the Sceptre<ref>{{UT|Aldarion}}</ref> but Meneldur only waited until the Spring of {{SA|883}}.<ref name=\"Chronology\"/>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Books and documents within the legendarium]]"}}}
