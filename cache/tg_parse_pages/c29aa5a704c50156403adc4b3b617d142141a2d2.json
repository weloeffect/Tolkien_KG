[[Belegaer]] broke through the mountains of the Ered Luin, creating a gulf. The course of the river Lhûn was altered so that it flowed into the gulf, giving it its name.<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref>\n\nThe remnant of Beleriand north of the gulf became known as [[Forlindon]], and the part south of it as [[Harlindon]]. At the eastern end of the Gulf the [[Grey Havens]] were established, but smaller havens were established in Forlindon and Harlindon as well: [[Forlond]] and [[Harlond (Lindon)|Harlond]].\n\nDuring the [[Second Age]] the ships of the [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]]s first came to the Gulf of Lune to visit the [[Noldor]] and [[Sindar]] under [[Gil-galad]] who remained behind, and during the [[Third Age]] from it the ships of the [[Eldar]] passed away into the [[Aman|West]].\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''\n:For the maps produced for use in the movies, [[Daniel Reeve]] changed the coastline of the Gulf of Lune by giving it the shape of New Zealand's Wellington Harbour.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Bays]]\n[[Category:Lindon]]\n[[de:Golf von Lhûn]]\n[[fi:Luninlahti]]"}}}
