It was centred around [[Amon Lanc]], the former site of the [[Necromancer]]'s fortress of [[Dol Guldur]]. Many of its people were [[Galadhrim]] formerly of [[Lothlórien]] who chose to abandon the Golden Wood and resettle in the cleansed eastern forest. [[Celeborn]] was its first and last known ruler.\n\nThe borders of East Lórien included all the forest from its southern eaves north to the [[Narrows of the Forest|Narrows]]. At its greatest extent, the realm stretched two hundred miles east to west and over a hundred miles north to south. The forest north of the Narrows was populated by [[Beornings]] and [[Woodmen]].\n==History==\nIn the [[Second Age]], [[Oropher]] established the capital of his [[Woodland Realm]] upon the hill of [[Amon Lanc]], but the Silvan Elves abandoned this settlement for unclear reasons. The ruin lay empty until roughly {{TA|1000}}, at which time the [[Necromancer]] claimed it as his abode and the place became known as [[Dol Guldur]].\n\nDuring the [[War of the Ring]], [[Galadriel]], Celeborn, and the [[Elves of Lórien]] [[Fall of Dol Guldur|tore down]] the stronghold of Dol Guldur. After the victory, on the day of the [[Yestarë|New Year]] [[Reckoning of Rivendell|of the Elves]] (6 April {{TA|3019}}), Celeborn met with the Elvenking [[Thranduil]] of the Woodland Realm in the midst of the forest. The two agreed to rename the cleansed Mirkwood to Eryn Lasgalen and divide it between themselves and the Beornings and Woodmen. Thranduil claimed the northern third of the forest, Celeborn claimed the south, and the Beornings and Woodmen were granted the middle.\n\nCeleborn ruled his new realm into the [[Fourth Age]], though he did not remain there long. After a span of only \"a few years,\" he retired to [[Rivendell]] to stay with his grandsons, the sons of Elrond. It is unknown if East Lórien continued as a realm after the departure of its founder, and if so, who may have succeeded him – if anyone. All that is known is that \"in the Greenwood the [[Silvan Elves]] remained untroubled\" for some time thereafter.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Regions]]\n[[Category:Rhovanion]]\n[[Category:Elven realms]]\n\n[[de:Ost-Lórien]]\n[[fi:Itä-Lórien]]"}}}
