After sleeping deep within the [[Misty Mountains]] for thousands of years, he was awoken by the [[Dwarves of Moria]] in the [[Third Age]] and was responsible for the death of [[King of Durin's Folk|King]] [[Durin VI]] and the ruin of [[Moria]]. It was this Balrog that was encountered by the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] during the [[Quest of the Ring]].\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nDurin's Bane was first created as a [[Maia]]. However, like other [[evil spirits]], the Balrog followed [[Morgoth]] to [[Arda]] soon after its creation, contending with [[Manwë]] and other [[Valar]].<ref>{{S|IId}}</ref>\n\nIt is not known in which of the [[Battles of Beleriand]] Durin's Bane fought in until the end of the [[First Age]], nor whether he served under [[Gothmog (Lord of Balrogs)|Gothmog]], the Lord of Balrogs. When the [[Host of the Valar]] defeated the hosts of Morgoth in the [[War of Wrath]], Durin's Bane managed to flee the overthrow of [[Thangorodrim]] and escaped into the east and hid in the roots of the [[Misty Mountains]] beneath [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]].<ref name=\"Durin\">{{App|Durin}}, fourth paragraph, p. 954</ref><ref>{{L|144}}, p. 180</ref>\n\n===Awakening and the Third Age===\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Dwarves Delve Too Deep.jpg|thumb|left|''The Dwarves delve too deep'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nFor more than five millennia, Durin's Bane hibernated in his deep hiding place at the roots of the mountains in Khazad-dûm. He remained undisturbed throughout the [[Second Age]] and most of the [[Third Age|Third]], before the ''[[mithril]]''-miners of [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] King [[Durin VI]] awoke him in {{TA|1980}}.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1980, p. 1087</ref> Durin was slain by the Balrog, at which point he became known as \"Durin's Bane\".<ref name=\"Durin\" />\n\nThe Dwarves attempted to fight the Durin's Bane, but his power was far too great. Despite their efforts to hold Khazad-dûm against it, [[Náin I|King Náin]] and many of the Dwarves were killed in {{TA|1981}}<ref name=\"Year1981\">{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1980, p. 1087</ref>, and the survivors were forced to flee.<ref name=\"Durin\" /> [[Orcs]] were able to creep into Moria<ref>{{UT|Amroth}}, p. 241</ref> and, as a result, many of the [[Silvan Elves]] of [[Lothlórien]] fled to the south.<ref name=\"Year1981\" />\n\nFor five hundred years, Moria was left to the Balrog.<ref name=\"January\">{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019, 15 January, p. 1092</ref> Over the course of many years, he became acquainted with the ancient tunnels delved by mysterious [[nameless things]] underneath Moria and the Mountains.<ref name=\"White\">{{TT|White}}, p. 501</ref>\n\nAround {{TA|2480}}, [[Orcs]] began to make secret strongholds in the Misty Mountains to block all of the passes, and [[Sauron]] began to send some of his creatures to Moria.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year ''c.'' 2480, p. 1087</ref> The Balrog allowed the Orcs and trolls to remain in Moria while he dwelt there, but they feared him.<ref name=\"Bridge\" /><ref group=\"note\">It is unknown whether the Balrog knew about Sauron being a new [[Dark Lord]], or if he would submit. Anycase he served Sauron's purposes indirectly.</ref>\n\nThe [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] was the climactic battle in the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]]. It took place before the [[Great Gate]] of Moria in [[Third Age 2799|T.A. 2799]] and was a victory for the Dwarves. However, the victors did not conquer Moria because [[Dáin Ironfoot]], having slain the Orc [[Azog]], felt the terror of the Balrog at the gate.<ref>{{App|Durin}}, p. 1075</ref> Despite a failed attempt to recolonize Moria by [[Balin]] in [[Third Age 2989|T.A. 2989]],<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2989, p. 1090</ref> Durin's Bane remained a menace in the ancient kingdom of the Dwarves, and its nature remained hidden to the outside world.\n\n===Passing of the Fellowship===\n[[File:Manuel Castañón - Flame of Udûn.jpg|thumb|<nowiki>'</nowiki>''Flame of Udûn''<nowiki>'</nowiki> by Manuel Castañón]]\nIn January of [[Third Age 3019|T.A. 3019]], the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] travelled through Moria on the way to [[Mount Doom]], reaching the [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm]] on [[15 January]] of that year.<ref name=\"January\" /> It was there they encountered the terrible creature, and the Elf [[Legolas]] instantly recognized it as a Balrog, while [[Gimli]] dropped his axe in awe, recognizing Durin's Bane. At once, the [[Wizards|Wizard]] [[Gandalf]] warned the members of the Fellowship that this creature was beyond them, commanding them to leave while he faced it.<ref name=\"Bridge\" />\n\nStanding firmly in the narrow bridge, Gandalf cried at the Balrog, which remained silent. The creature's fire dimmed and darkness spread around it while Gandalf's light stood. The Balrog struck out at the Wizard, but [[Glamdring]], Gandalf's sword, prevailed and the creature's sword was broken. The Balrog then jumped ahead and Gandalf broke the Bridge in front of him, but as the Balrog fell, he wrapped his whip around Gandalf's knees. This caused Gandalf to stagger and fall, and he was dragged into the abyss as he cried \"''Fly, you fools!''\" to the Fellowship.<ref name=\"Bridge\" />\n[[File:The Brothers Hildebrandt - The Battle on Durin's Tower.jpg|thumb|250px|\"The Battle on [[Durin's Tower]]\" by [[The Brothers Hildebrandt|Greg Hildebrandt]]]]\nNeither he nor the Balrog were killed by the fall, and Gandalf pursued the creature for eight days until they climbed to the peak of [[Celebdil|Zirakzigil]], where [[Battle of the Peak|they fought]] for three days and two nights. In the end, the Balrog was cast down and his body broke the mountain-side as it fell. Gandalf himself died following this ordeal, but was later sent back to Middle-earth with even greater powers as Gandalf the White.<ref name=\"White\" />\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nDuring the composition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', in the first \"Sketch of the Moria chapter\", [[Tolkien]] conceived that the Fellowship was pursued by Orcs and a [[Black Rider]], but soon wrote above it was a Balrog.<ref>{{RS|4XXV}}, p. 462</ref>\n\nIn the first full narrative of the chapter, the description of the Balrog is more human-like, which Tolkien noted should be changed to be less clear: \"''A figure strode to the fissure, no more than man-high yet terror seemed to go before it. They could see the furnace-fire of its yellow eyes from afar; its arms were very long; it had a red [?tongue]. Through the air it sprang over the fiery fissure. The flames leaped up to greet it and wreathed about it. Its streaming hair seemed to catch fire...''\". Tolkien also rejected a sentence of Gandalf's cry to the Balrog: \"''Go back into the fiery depths. It is forbidden for any Balrog to come beneath the sky since [[Fionwë]] son of [[Manwë]] overthrew Thangorodrim.''\"<ref>{{TI|M2}}, pp. 198-199</ref>\n\nAlthough it had no repercussion on the final version of the story, Tolkien considered in a hasty note that the battle on the Bridge was actually between Gandalf and [[Saruman]], apparently resulting on Gandalf coming out clad in white.<ref>{{TI|XII}}, p. 236</ref>\n\nIn the drafts of the \"[[Lothlórien (chapter)|Lothlórien]]\" chapter, [[Celeborn]] and [[Galadriel]] think that no Balrog could lie in the Misty Mountains, so it should have been sent by Sauron from [[Orodruin]].<ref>{{TI|XIII}}, pp. 247, cf. note 11</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Durin's Bane in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings (1978 film) - Balrog.jpg|Durin's Bane in [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy - Balrog.jpg|Durin's Bane in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Durin's Bane.jpg|Durin's Bane in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\nFile:Aragorn's Quest - Balrog.jpg|Durin's Bane in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest]]''\nFile:The Rings of Power (TV series) - Durin's Bane.png|Durin's Bane in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'' series \n</gallery>\n\n'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''\n:The Balrog has wings and appears capable of limited flight. The head resembles a lion but the rest of the body was rendered in matte black, a technique commonly used for shadowy surreal effect in rotoscope animation.\n'''1981:''' [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|'''''The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)''''']]\n\nThe identity of Durin's Bane as a Balrog is apparently common knowledge among the Wise as Gandalf explains its history to the Fellowship in Moria before their encounter with it. He initially fails to connect this with the dark power he encounters, and Celeborn still has no knowledge of it. Balrogs are bafflingly stated to be the deadliest of the servants of Sauron though Gandalf also refers to it as a Spawn of [[Morgoth|Melkor]]\n\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''\n:Durin's Bane has wings. Jackson's Demon of Might was indistinct, a real blend of shadow and fire. Only his horned head, cloven feet, and clawed hands could clearly be seen. In the film continuity, the Orcs of Moria (here specified as \"goblins\") have crafted their armor and weapons to match the fiery appearance of the Balrog. <ref>Chris Smith, ''The Lord of The Rings: Weapons and Warfare'',  p.62</ref> Gandalf is also aware of the creature's identity prior to entering Moria, having previously learned of it from [[Saruman]].\n\n'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''\n:The Balrog is the boss of the level \"Abyss Fight\". He cannot be harmed except when he is stunned with Gandalf's lightning.\n\n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age]]'':'''\n:The players must assist Gandalf in his fight with the Balrog. This fight is notable among players of the game for its difficulty and the Balrog's very high amount of health points.\n\n'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'':'''\n:Many of the Evil factions can summon a Balrog, specifically Durin's Bane, for a short period of time. He is one of the mightiest units in the game, only able to be summoned with experience points. He is similar in design to the Balrog in the movie.\n\n'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''\n:Like in the previous installment, the Balrog can be summoned by evil factions.\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The real name of Durin's Bane is given as \"'''Askâdurs'''\" and he is revealed to have fought against Dwarves as part of [[Morgoth]]'s armies during the [[First Age]]. He is encountered in various flashback instances (where the player controls historical characters), which showcase his awakening by Dwarves in [[Third Age 1980|TA 1980]], the fall of Khazad-dûm [[Third Age 1981|the year after]] and the Dwarves of [[Balin]]'s company fleeing from the ancient evil, among others. After Gandalf defeats him, the lifeless body of Durin's Bane can be found on the slopes of Zirakzigil. Despite the players knowing that the Balrog is dead, another Servant of Sauron tests their will and fears by portraying an illusion of him. In the illusion, the fight between Gandalf and the Balrog on the [[Endless Stair]] is recreated, until it ends the opposite way of the actual event: the Balrog defeats the Wizard, throwing his lifeless body from Zirakzigil. Players have to defeat the Balrog in order to combat the illusion.\n\n'''2009: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'':'''\n:Durin's Bane is resurrected after his defeat by Gandalf, and must be fought again in Moria. In the Evil Campaign, Durin's Bane is playable in two battles. He kills Gimli, who makes his last stand in Moria, and [[Treebeard]], who takes part in the final battle for [[the Shire]].\n\n'''2013: ''[[Lego The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game]]'':'''\n:Durin's Bane is only seen as a light that chases the player(s) through Moria. When they reach the Bridge of Khazad-dûm, he appears in a cutscene where Gandalf destroys the bridge and the Balrog pulls him down. The player then controls Gandalf and has to grab Glamdring and land on Durin's Bane and stab him while avoiding the Balrog's fiery breath. When this is over, the game starts another cutscene that ends the level. Later, Gandalf appears on a snowy mountain with a tower on top. When he reaches the top of the tower, the Balrog climbs on. The Balrog repeatedly sweeps his fiery whip and strikes the ground with his sword. Lightning then begins to strike at one place and the Balrog breathes fire and is weakened. Gandalf then uses his sword to direct the lightning at Durin's Bane and his health goes down. The lightning will strike at three different places and when the Balrog loses all of his health by being hit three times, he will fall off the mountain and die.\n\n'''2022: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'', Season One:'''\n:'''Episode 7: ''[[The Eye]]'':'''\n::Durin's Bane makes an appearance lurking beneath a large [[Mithril]] vein at the very depths of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]].
