Tolkien has been received in the twenty-first century. With a broad range of Tolkien's writings being published in the last twenty-two years, adaptions embellishing on Tolkien's stories, and new philosophies offering innovative ways to read Tolkien, the twenty-first century continues to bring us revised visions of Tolkien. This proceedings offers a range of insights into how recent adaptions and philosophies have expanded Tolkien's legendarium. It was also the first of three seminars that the Tolkien Society hosted online in 2021, collectively welcoming over 1600 people from across the globe.\n\nPublished under the auspices of the Society's Peter Roe Memorial Fund, this proceedings features a collection of four papers delivered at the Tolkien Society 2021 winter seminar.\n}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.tolkiensociety.org/store/twenty-first-century-receptions-of-tolkien/ Official webpage]\n\n{{peterroe}}\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Publications by the Tolkien Society]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]"}}}
