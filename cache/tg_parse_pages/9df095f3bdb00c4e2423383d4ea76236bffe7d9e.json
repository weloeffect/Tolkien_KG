It did not have a kerb or rail and was so narrow that it could only be crossed in single file. The depth of the chasm was incredible and the ceiling was high. On the eastern side of the bridge was a flight of stairs leading to the [[First Hall]] and the eastern gates. The narrowness of the bridge was meant to help defend the interior of Khazad-dûm against an enemy that had already breached the outermost defences on the eastern side of Khazad-dûm.<ref name=Bridge/>\n\n==History==\nOn 15 January {{TA|3019}},<ref name=Great/> [[Gandalf]] and the rest of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] fled over the bridge from the [[Durin's Bane|Balrog]], a large number of [[Orcs]] and two [[Trolls]]. Gandalf remained behind in the middle of the bridge to hold it against the Balrog. After a fight with the Balrog, Gandalf resorted to destroying the part of the bridge on which the Balrog stood with his staff. The Balrog fell into the chasm, but caught Gandalf with his whip and pulled him down with him.<ref name=Bridge/>\n\nIt is possible that the [[Dwarves]] reclaimed Moria in the [[Durin VII|Fourth Age]] and rebuilt the bridge.<ref>{{PM|Aiv}}, second version of the manuscript, p. 277</ref><ref>{{SD|XI2}}, Q.
