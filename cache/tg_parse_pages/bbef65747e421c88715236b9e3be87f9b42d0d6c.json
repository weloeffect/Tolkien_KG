In its fountain-filled gardens stood images of the [[Two Trees of Valinor]], made by [[Turgon]] himself, called [[Glingal and Belthil]].<ref>{{S|15}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Fall of Gondolin]], the Tower was defended by the men of the king's house-hold until it was overthrown, \"and great and mighty was its fall and the fall of Turgon in its ruin.\"<ref name=Tuor/>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nThere are more details told in the early version of the [[legendarium]] of ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. It is said that it was the loftiest of all towers in Gondolin. When [[Tuor]] and [[Voronwë]] came to Gondolin, they were received by the King on the stairs, with [[Meglin]] at his right hand and [[Idril]] at his left. There Tuor gave [[Ulmo's warning]] to the King with prophetical words.<ref name=Gondolin>{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|160–1}} \n\nDuring the siege of the city, Turgon watched most of the battle from his tower, sending troops where they were needed.<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|180}} Once the King ordered the survivors to leave the city, he remained behind, climbing to the topmost pinnacle of the white tower where he cried: \"''Great is the victory of the [[Noldoli]]!''\". While the [[Exiles of Gondolin|exiles]] left, the [[house of the King]] gathered around the base of the king's tower to fight till the end. Later, [[Idril]] and Tuor saw from [[Gar Ainion]] how the tower was beset. Then the [[dragons]] crushed the base and the tower fell with a terrible clangour, and thus died King Turgon.<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|185–7}}\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Gondolin]]\n[[Category:Towers]]\n[[fi:Kuninkaan torni]]"}}}
