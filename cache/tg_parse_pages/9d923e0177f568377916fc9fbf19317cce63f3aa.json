On the Western bank is Vegbár, a toll-collecting station of the [[Beornings]], making the Old Ford one and the same with the [[Ford of Carrock]]. Towards the end of the [[War of the Ring]], [[Orcs]] and [[Wargs]] came down from the [[Misty Mountains]] but were defeated in the Battle of the Old Ford by the Beornings and the [[Woodmen]], who also suffered many casualties. [[Elrond]], [[Arwen]] and their household also travelled by the Old Ford on their way to [[Minas Tirith]] for Arwen's wedding. Later in the summer of [[Third Age 3019|T.A. 3019]] Prince [[Durin VII]] led a campaign to reclaim [[Gundabad]], and a mission shows dwarven builders construct a wooden replacement for the missing section of the ''Hadhodiant'' so as to not be reliant on the Old Ford.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Ford of Carrock]]\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Fords]]\n[[Category:Rhovanion]]\n\n[[de:Alte Furt]]\n[[fi:Vanha Kahlaamo]]"}}}
