When the [[Noldor]] came back to [[Middle-earth]] at the end of the [[First Age]], they spread the Light of Valinor that was in them to the [[Edain]], so that the Edain became a nobler people.\n==Inspiration==\n[[Christianity]] has a concept called \"Uncreated Light\", being the emminence of God itself, before any fall, or anything else created. There is a branch of Orthodox theology that examines the [[Wikipedia:Tabor Light|Tabor Light]].\n\n[[Category:Aman]]\n[[Category:Concepts]]"}}}
