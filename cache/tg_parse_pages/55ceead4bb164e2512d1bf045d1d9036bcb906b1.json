His men bore great battle-axes and were well-armed.<ref name=\"MT\"/> Forlong fought bravely in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], but the opposition proved too strong. Separated from his men and his horse slain, Forlong was killed. He was remembered in the [[Song of the Mounds of Mundburg]].<ref>{{RK|Battle}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Forlong'' was a [[Pre-Númenórean]] name of unknown meaning.<ref>{{App|Men}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Forlong.jpg|thumb|left||150px|Forlong in '' [[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n\n'''2015'': ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Forlong is first found in [[Minas Tirith]] before the battle in the \"Merry Swan\" tavern on the third level of the city, reminiscing on their youth with his friends [[Hirluin]] and Neldir. Later, both Forlong and Hilruin fight in the defence of the White City on the walls of the First Cicle. After the Rohirrim army arrives, both of them rush outside the city gates and faces their foes together before Hirluin is slain in view of his friend. Forlong himself is gravely wounded and after the battle is over is found by the player on the field. He shares that he saw the visage of Thorongil on the field of battle but believes it to be his dying fever until Aragorn comes to his side. Amazed to see the man from the days of his youth untouched by years, Forlong departs in peace.\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Gondorians]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:Mannish words]]\n[[Category:Names]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n\n[[de:Forlong]]\n[[fi:Forlong]]"}}}
