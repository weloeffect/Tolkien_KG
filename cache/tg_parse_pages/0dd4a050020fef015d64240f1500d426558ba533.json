Men would come into the House to pray to Morgoth and to offer gifts. Morgoth would speak from afar to those who prayed in the House, giving them commands to do his bidding. To the cruelest and strongest men who came most often to the House, Morgoth gave them great gifts.\n\nFrom the House of the Lord, all of Mankind at one point had pledged their service to Morgoth, thus bringing about the [[Darkness (concept)|Fall of Man]]. When [[Edain|some men]] began to reject Morgoth's rule, his servants would take them into the House of the Lord to be sacrificed in fire.<ref>{{MR|Finrod}}, pp. 346-348</ref>\n\nIt is unknown what became of the House of the Lord after Morgoth left.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Temple]]\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings]]\n[[Category:Evil]]"}}}
