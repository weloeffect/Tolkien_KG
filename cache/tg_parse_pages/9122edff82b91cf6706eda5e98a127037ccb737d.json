To [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] she gave a little box of plain grey wood, unadorned save for a single silver rune upon the lid.<ref>{{FR|II8}}, p. 375</ref>\n\nIt contained earth from Galadriel's orchard, the earth was like grey dust, soft and fine, and in the middle of which was a seed, like a small nut with a silver shell.\n\nAfter the [[Scouring of the Shire]], Sam planted saplings in all the places where specially beautiful and beloved trees had been destroyed, and he put a grain of the precious dust in the soil at the root of each. The little silver nut he planted in the [[Party Field]] to replace the [[Party Tree]], and the nut grew into the [[Golden Tree]]: \"the only Mallorn west of the [[misty Mountains|Mountains]] and east of the [[Belegaer|Sea]], and one of the finest in the world\".<ref>{{RK|VI9}}, pp. 1022-2023</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{Giftsofgaladriel}}\n\n[[Category:Gifts of Galadriel]]"}}}
