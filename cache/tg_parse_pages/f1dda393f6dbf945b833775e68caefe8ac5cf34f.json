At the time, [[Manwë]] and his [[hawks]] saw the first [[elves]] - when the inhabitants of [[Valinor]] heard the news they cried happily ''I Eldar tulier'' - \"the Eldar have come\". Manwë  decided to unchain Melko early, however leaving manacles and fetters from the ''[[tilkal]]'' on him.\n\n[[Nornorë]] took the three leaders of Elves to Valinor: these were [[Ingwë|Isil Inwë]], ruling over the [[Vanyar|Teleri]]; [[Finwë|Finwë Nólomë]], ruling over the [[Noldoli]]; and [[Thingol|Tinwë Linto]], ruling over the [[Solosimpi]]. Meril explained she was a descendant of Inwë, while Finwë was the father of [[Turgon]], and Tinwë later stayed with [[Melian|Wendelin]] in [[Hithlum|Hisilómë]].\n\nThe [[Valar]] decided to invite the Elves to Valinor. Only [[Makar]], [[Meássë]], [[Mandos]], [[Fui]], and [[Ossë]] were less enthusiastic. Melko joined the majority, but later lied that he was against \"imprisoning\" the Elves.\n\n[[Ulmo]] and his whale [[Uin]] used [[Ossë]]'s island as a ferry, bringing first the Teleri, then the Noldoli, and finally the Solosimpi. Using his island angered Ossë, who stopped it in the middle of the [[Great Sea]], where it become known as [[Tol Eressëa]], the Lonely Island. Afterwards, the Teleri and Noldoli built [[Kôr]]. Eventually, after many years, the Solosimpi used swans and sea birds to take them on ships to Valinor. In Valinor, the Noldoli made a large quantity of gems, of which last and most beautiful were opals, until [[Fëanor]] made [[Silmarils|Silmarili]].\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Coming of the Elves and the Making of Kor}}"}}}
