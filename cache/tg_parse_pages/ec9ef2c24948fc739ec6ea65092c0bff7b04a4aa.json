Kilby]], which describes Kilby's interaction with [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] in the summer of [[1964]], and his reading of the manuscript of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', the first \"outsider\" to see it. Kilby also writes about Tolkien's friendship with [[C.S. Lewis]] and [[Charles Williams]].\n\nThe book includes an inscription written by Tolkien in a copy of ''Perelandra'' by [[C.S. Lewis]]. Also included are extracts from numerous letters (see [[Letter to Clyde S. Kilby (unknown date)|Letter to Clyde S. Kilby]], [[Letter to Joan O. Falconer]] and [[Letter to Roger Verhulst (9 March 1966)|Letter to Roger Verhulst]]) and references to conversations between Tolkien and Kilby.\n\n==From the publisher==\nJ.R.R. Tolkien's ''The Silmarillion'' has been one of the most eagerly awaited books of this century. It tells the story of Middle Earth (''sic'') before the events of ''The Lord of the Rings''.\n\nClyde Kilby spent a summer working with Tolkien on the manuscript of ''The Silmarillion''. In this book he describes that time. He builds up a fascinating portrait of Professor Tolkien, his work as a [[Christianity|Christian]] writer, and his friendship with [[C.S. Lewis]], [[Charles Williams]] and the rest of 'The [[Inklings]]'. \n[[File:Tolkien and The Silmarillion.jpg|175px|thumb|Cover of the US edition by Harold Shaw Publishers]]\n==Contents==\n# First Meeting\n# Summer with Tolkien\n# Chronology of Composition and Geography of Middle-Earth (''sic'')\n# Tolkien as Christian Writer\n# Tolkien, Lewis and Williams\nOriginally, a synopsis of ''The Silmarillion'' was to be included, but this was removed at the request of [[Christopher Tolkien]]. The summary was subsequently published in ''[[SEVEN|VII: An Anglo-American Literary Review]]'', [[SEVEN 19|Volume 19]], [[2002]]. A translation of this chapter was also included in ''[[La Feuille de la Compagnie 3]]''.\n\n==External links==\n* ''[https://archive.org/details/tolkiensilmarill0000kilb Tolkien and The Silmarillion] at the [[wikipedia:Internet Archive|Internet Archive]]'' (available to borrow for free)\n*[http://www.theplaceofthelion.com/kilby_clyde_jrr.doc Summary and review by Diana Pavlac Glyer], award-winning author and professor of English at Azusa Pacific University\n==References==\n<small>\n*''[http://www.tolkienbooks.net/php/details2.php?id=763 Tolkien and the Silmarillion]'', at Tolkienbooks.net\n*[[Åke Bertenstam]], ''[http://www.forodrim.org/bibliography/tolklist.html A Chronological Bibliography of Books about Tolkien]''</small>\n{{title|italic}}\n[[Category:Books with contribution by J.R.R.
