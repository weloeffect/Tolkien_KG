This scene was not featured in the theatrical release of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''.\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn the aftermath of the [[Battle of Helm's Deep]], [[Legolas]] approaches [[Gimli]] through the litter of bodies of [[Uruk-hai]] and proudly announces his final count of forty-two killed. Gimli half mockingly congratulates him before announcing he is sitting on his forty-third. Suddenly, Legolas draws and arrow and shoots the Uruk, claiming it was twitching. Gimli tells him \"He's twitching because he's got my axe buried in his nervous system!\" As he moves his axe, the legs of the Uruk twitch. \n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers scenes|62]]"}}}
