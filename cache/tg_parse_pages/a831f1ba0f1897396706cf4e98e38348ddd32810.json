Therefore there are many versions, each attached to the current version of the Silmarillion he was writing at the time.\n\n* \"[[The Earliest Annals of Valinor]]\", written in early 1930s. Published in ''[[The Shaping of Middle-earth]]''.\n* \"[[The Later Annals of Valinor]]\", written in late 1930s. Published in ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]''.\n* \"[[The Annals of Aman]]\", written in 1950-51. Published in ''[[Morgoth's Ring]]''. They were one of the main sources used by [[Christopher Tolkien]] for the composition of his ''[[Silmarillion]]''.\n\n==See also==\n*[[The Texts and their Relations]]\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Books and documents within the legendarium]]\n[[fi:Valinorin annaalit]]"}}}
