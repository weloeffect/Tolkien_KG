Lyon also suggests that the darkness of the poem is related to the Winter Solstice, the shortest day of the year (22 December in 1914), and that Tolkien was more broadly influenced by the Antiphons sung earlier in Vespers, one of which lay behind the Old English ''Crist'' which inspired ''The Voyage of Earendel the Evening Star''.\"</ref>, the \"Tenebrae\".<ref name=\"Lyon\">{{webcite |author= Patrick J.
