It then turned northwest and watered the densest stands of trees in the forest. The stream marked the precise border between the [[Eastfold]], and the [[Gondor]]ian land of [[Anórien]] and thus part of the woods belonged to either realm. The great West Road passed through a cutting in the wood to avoid the wet lands to the north. From the road there was also a path to the summit of the Halifirien maintained by the [[Beacon-wardens]].<ref name=\"Cirion\">{{UT|Eorl}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe road that cut through the northern bounds of the wood had been built by the [[Exiles of Númenor]] soon after the founding of [[Arnor]] and Gondor.<ref>{{UT|8e}}, note 32</ref>\n\nAt the end of the [[War of the Last Alliance]], [[Isildur]] took his nephew [[Meneldil]] and a company of trusted friends on a ride about the borders of Gondor. Returning from the northern boundary, Isildur came to the Eryn Fuir and had a path made to the summit of Amon Anwar, which was green and treeless. There they raised a mound for a casket to be the [[Tomb of Elendil|tomb and memorial]] of [[Elendil]]. This spot was chosen because it stood near to the center of the lands claimed by the South Kingdom.<ref>{{UT|Tradition}}</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|2510}}, after [[Eorl]], lord of the [[Éothéod]], and his riders had saved the Steward [[Cirion]] and the army of Gondor at the [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant]],<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> Cirion brought Eorl through the Eryn Fuir to Amon Anwar to grant him the land of [[Calenardhon]], thus founding the realm of [[Rohan]].<ref name=\"Cirion\"/> With the coming of the [[Rohirrim]], the forest became known as \"Firienholt\" in [[Rohanese]].<ref name=VT42/>\n\nIn {{TA|2864}} King [[Folca]] hunted and slew the great boar of [[Everholt]] in the Firien Wood, but died of the wounds the beast had given him.<ref>{{App|Mark}}, 13.
