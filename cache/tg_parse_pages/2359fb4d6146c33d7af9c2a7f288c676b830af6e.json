The Weedbrook was invented for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'' by [[Amazon Studios]].\n\n== History ==\nIn the late [[Second Age]], the [[Rhovanion Hills|hills]] around the Weedbrook was a sight that a certain [[Harfoots|Harfoot community]] passed by when migrating from one seasonal haven to the next, particularly from the [[Norfield Glen]] to the [[Grove]].\n\nDuring one such migration , while staring out at the distant Weedbrook, [[Elanor Brandyfoot]] taught [[The Stranger]] how to pronounce the word \"''mi-gra-tion''\" correctly rather than saying \"''my great thumb''\". They left the ledge upon hearing [[Marigold Brandyfoot]] yell for Elanor to return. Back at the Brandyfoot and Proudfellow carts, Marigold criticized [[Largo Brandyfoot]] for accidentally poking her lower back with his crutch, threatening to pluck off his toe hair in his sleep. To this, Largo sarcastically suggests that she plucks off his ears to save him from her snoring. Whem Marigold denied that she snored, Elanor and [[Dilly Brandyfoot]] voiced their agreement with Largo. Afterwards, [[Poppy Proudfellow]] tried to encourage them all to focus as the Grove was not going to come to them. In response, Elanor suggested that Poppy should sing one of her mother's old [[This Wandering Day|walking songs]].\n\nEncouraged by the song, the Harfoots continue their migration to the Grove, leaving the Weedbrook behind.\n\nLater, a group of three [[Mystics]] possibly passed by the Weedbrook when they were stalking the Harfoot migration trail, seeking to find the Stranger.\n\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) locations]]"}}}
