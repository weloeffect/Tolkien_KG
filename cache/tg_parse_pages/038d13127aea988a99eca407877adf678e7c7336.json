By the last years of the Age, the remote Stone of Orthanc was all but forgotten by the [[Stewards of Gondor]]. The [[Wizard]] [[Saruman]] had not forgotten the Stone, however, and took over the stewardship of Orthanc with the hope that the Stone would still be there. \n\nSaruman's hopes were realised when he unlocked the impregnable Tower he found the Stone waiting inside, untouched for thousands of years. He kept his discovery secret from the [[White Council]], intending to use it for his own designs. It seems, however, that Saruman failed to account for the other ''palantíri'' in Middle-earth. The lost [[Ithil-stone]] had fallen into the hands of [[Sauron]], who used its power to bend the Stone of Orthanc to his own will, and with it, Saruman himself.<ref name=\"Palantir\">{{TT|Palantir}}</ref>\n\nAfter suffering great setbacks during the War of the Ring, Saruman lost the Stone, to his great anger. While he parleyed with [[Gandalf]] from the Tower, his servant [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]]—not realizing the nature of the Stone—cast it at their enemies below, unwittingly granting them a great gift. [[Pippin]] picked it up and Gandalf hastily took it from him.<ref>{{TT|Voice}}</ref> The Stone was used twice after being thrown from the Tower,  each time leading the user to encounter the Dark Lord himself. Pippin was the first to use it, in a foolish mistake. Having felt drawn to it, he secretly took the Stone from Gandalf while he slept. He was revealed to Sauron, who falsely believed Pippin to be a captive in Orthanc, where he thought the Stone still resided. Having rescued Pippin from Sauron's inlfuence via the Stone, Gandalf entrusted the ''palantír'' to [[Aragorn]] for safekeeping.<ref name=\"Palantir\" />\n\nShortly after, [[Aragorn]] knowingly used the ''palantír'' to reveal his ancestry to Sauron and displayed his sword Andúril, reforged from the sword that had cut the [[the One Ring|Ring]] from Sauron's finger some three thousand years before. This act drew Sauron into open war, distracting his attention from his own land of [[Mordor]], so giving [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] a chance to reach [[Mount Doom]].<ref>{{RK|Company}}</ref><ref>{{RK|Debate}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Images of the Orthanc-stone|Images of the Orthanc-stone]]\n{{references}}\n{{palantiri}}\n[[Category:Palantíri]]"}}}
