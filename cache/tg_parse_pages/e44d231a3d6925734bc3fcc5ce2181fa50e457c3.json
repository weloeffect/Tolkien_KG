It flows south through several waterfalls, the largest of them being \"the Reikfoss of Greylin\". Along with the two falls of [[Langwell]] from the same height, the Reikfoss raises a large cloud of mist into the air, giving the surrounding area its name: \"Misthallow\". The two rivers join past [[Framsburg]], forming the Great River.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Rhovanion]]\n[[Category:Rivers]]\n[[de:Grauquell]]\n[[fi:Varjovesi]]"}}}
