While they must have been mainly [[Teleri]] in origin, a tradition lingered that some were in fact [[Noldor]] who failed to embark because they had either explored too far or had struck up friendships with the Teleri who came up behind.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 134</ref>\n\nThey were the first Elves of [[Middle-earth]] encountered by the [[Noldor]] when they returned from [[Aman]].<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref>\n\n[[Fingolfin]] took up lordship in Hithlum, with most of his own people dwelling around the shores of Lake Mithrim,<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref> and there was a degree of intermingling between the two peoples. It is not stated to what extent the Grey-elves of Mithrim participated in the [[Wars of Beleriand]] under Fingolfin and [[Fingon]]. \n\n[[Thingol]] had small love for the Northern Sindar who had in regions near to [[Angband]] come under the dominion of Morgoth, and were accused of sometimes entering his service and providing him with spies. The Sindarin used by the Sons of Fëanor also was of the Northern dialect; and they were hated in Doriath.<ref>{{PM|Rosnotes}}, note 6</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], they sheltered [[Rían]];<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref> when she departed Hithlum, one of the Elves, [[Annael]], fostered her son [[Tuor]].<ref>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>\n\n==Language==\n{{Main|North Sindarin}}\nThe Elves of Mithrim spoke a marked dialect of [[Sindarin]].<ref name=\"Author\">{{WJ|Author}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Mithrim'' has two alternate etymologies. In the earlier version, ''Mithrim'' was [[Noldorin]] in origin, including the roots ''mith-'' \"fog, misty, grey\" and ''-rhim(b)'' \"cold\" or \"cold lake\".<ref>{{LR|P3}}</ref>\n\nA later version is that ''Mithrim'' \"grey folk\" was applied by the Sindar of Beleriand to their kindred who had gone north into Hithlum. The climate north of [[Ered Wethrin]] was cool, misty, and grey, but the Elves also wove a grey cloth that aided in their concealment. It is also suggested that the Noldor first used the term ''Sindar'' (or ''Sindeldi'') to refer to the Elves of Mithrim, later applying it to all the [[Sindarin]]-speaking Elves of Beleriand.<ref name=\"Author\">{{WJ|Author}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Elven peoples]]\n[[Category:Moriquendi]]\n[[Category:Sindar]]"}}}
