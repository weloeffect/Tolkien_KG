Apparently the [[Notion Club|Club]] discussed more of [[Michael George Ramer|Michael Ramer's]] adventures.\n\n;'''Night 63''': [[13 March]] [[1987]]\n:Only the last page is left from the entry of this night. They talked about legendary travels. Afterwards, Ramer, [[Arundel Lowdham]], and [[Nicholas Guildford]] walked together in the streets of [[Oxford]] and reached the [[Wikipedia:Radcliffe Camera|Radcliffe Camera]], illuminated by the moonlight and with a cloud nearby that looked like it emerged from the dome. Seeing this, Lowdham turned pale and cursed someone unconsciously. Ramer and Guildford parted ways with him, and commented on how weird Lowdham was acting lately.\n\n;'''Night 64''': [[27 March]] [[1987]]\n:There was only one quiet meeting during the Holy Week holidays, which was held in Guildford's rooms. Neither Ramer nor Lowdham attended, and Guildford read an essay on ancient [[Wikipedia:Jutland|Jutland]].\n\n;'''Night 65''': [[8 May]] [[1987]]\n:The meeting was hold in [[Philip Frankley]]'s rooms in [[Wikipedia:The Queen's College (Oxford)|Queen's]]. All main members attended, and they wished Ramer to talk more, but he did not seem to. During the next hour, conversation hopped about and Lowdham was quite restless. Then the conversation, led by Lowdham and Frankley, turned to neologisms. Frankley explained that neologisms introduced by younger generations were an impoverishment to actual language, while Lowdham thought that [[languages]] and their sounds always evolved. While defending Frankley's right to choose how to talk, Lowdham also insisted that people had always been choosing collectively, which aroused a comment by Ramer: \"''You talk almost as if you'd seen or heard Language since its beginning...''\". Lowdham denied it, but said \"''Only since...''\" before breaking off the conversation and going to the window. The night sky was full of clouds and stars.\n\n:The other members derived the conversation to the matter of myths' origins. [[Wilfrid Trewin Jeremy|Wilfrid Jeremy]] explained myths were not mere inventions, but they had their roots in the human Being and its history: even if idealized, the showed something true about the Past, and even real details about the lands and individual men. Frankley doubt about tales being true as commonly thought, and Ramer pointed out anything in the past, even what happened the day before, is always recounted. But unlike mere fiction, great myths and legends had a depth that could move the minds of entire peoples. Guildford asked then what would be found if one could see back to the past using Ramer's system of dream-travelling. \"''If you were seeking the story that has most power and significance for human minds, then probably that's is the version that you'ld find''\" answered Ramer, to which other members added that whatever findings could be made that way, they would be fragmentary, although vivid. \n\n:Then Lowdham murmured that some stories can come to life on their own, unlike [[Norman Keeps]]' simplist vision of the Dark Ages. Angry, he cursed [[Sauron|Zigūr]], and everyone remained silent, confused. Lowdham was unable to explained this name, and then ran to the window speaking in an unknown language, opened it and cried out loud: \"Behold the [[Eagles]] of the [[Lords of the West]]! They are coming over [[Númenor|Nūmenōr]]!\". Outside, a great cloud was covering the stars in the West, resembling two great wings. Suddenly, Lowdham closed the window and the curtains, and sat in a chair.\n\n:Ramer broke the silence, asking about the name of ''Nūmenōr'', but Lowdham answered this name was coming to him, but had no idea about it. Then Ramer said that ''Nūmenōr'' was his name for [[Atlantis]]. Jeremy also stated he recognized that name from something he could not remember. Therefore they all three agreed to explore this matter using Ramer's memory method. Lowdham closed the meeting, stating he was \"fightfully tired\".\n\n<center><big>''Summary to be completed...''</big></center>\n\n== See also ==\n* \"''[[Narīka 'nBāri 'nAdūn yanākhim]]''\"\n* \"''[[Kadō zigūrun zabathān unakkha]]''\"\n* \"''[[O sauron túle nukumna]]''\"\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:''The Notion Club Papers'' Part Two}}\n\n[[Category:Sauron Defeated chapters]]"}}}
