Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator''''' is a collection of paintings (mostly watercolour) and drawings by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] for his stories, published in [[1995]]. The book was edited by [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]].\n\n==Overview==\nThe book explores Tolkien's art at length, from his childhood paintings and drawings to his final sketches. It reproduces 200 examples of his artwork (around 100 of them were previously unpublished). At its heart are his illustrations for his books, especially ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Also examined are the pictures Tolkien made for his children (notably in his ''[[Letters from Father Christmas]]'' and ''[[Mr. Bliss]]''), his expressive calligraphy, his love of decoration, and his contributions to the typography and design of his books. There is an appendix on Tolkien's calligraphy.\n\n==Reception==\nThe book won the 1996 [[Wikipedia:Mythopoeic Awards|Mythopoeic Scholarship Award in Inklings Studies]].<ref>[https://www.mythsoc.org/awards/awards-scholarship.htm Mythopoeic Awards – Scholarship] (accessed 11 June 2022)</ref>\n\nIt was well received by scholars and critics. The Tolkien Library called the book a significant contribution to understanding Tolkien's life and art, \"a full book's worth even without the artwork\".<ref>[https://tolkienlibrary.com/art/artistillustr/description.htm Books with Tolkien Art and Tolkien inspired art] (accessed 11 June 2022)</ref>\n\nRaymond Lister, reviewing the book for the literary journal ''VII'', writes that it is uncommon for writers also to be illustrators, with instances like William Blake and Beatrix Potter. He states that Tolkien rightly considered himself an amateur, though his work gained professional polish over the years. In Lister's view, Tolkien was at his best when illustrating his own \"romances\", with fictional landscapes populated by dragons; and when working for children. In his view, Hammond and Scull have researched widely, as shown by the notes, and written \"a good book ... extensively and beautifully illustrated ... its text ... an excellent example of how scholarship and clear prose—so often mutually exclusive—should be combined\".\n\n==Publication history and gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"125px\" heights=\"125px\">\nFile:Artist and Illustrator 1995.jpg|1995 hardcover\nFile:Artist and Illustrator 1998.jpeg|1998 paperback\nFile:Artist and Illustrator 2004.png|2004 hardcover\n</gallery>\n\n*[[HarperCollins]] hardcover ([[1995]]), pp.&nbsp;207.
