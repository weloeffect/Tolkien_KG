Instead, Elvish lords or Kings (as [[Númenórean]]s later) tended to hand on lordship and affairs to their descendants if they could or were engrossed in some pursuit; often this resignation would occur after they passed 200 \"age-years\".<ref>{{NM|P1vii}}, p. 62</ref>\n\n===Foundation===\nThe Noldor, that part of the [[Tatyar]] who participated in the [[Great Journey]], were led by [[Finwë]]. Finwë was one of the three elves summoned to [[Valinor]] by [[Oromë]] to serve as messengers to their fellows,<ref name=\"S3\">{{S|3}}</ref> and later became the ruler of the Noldor in Valinor, who lived in the city of [[Tirion|Tirion upon Túna]]. He became known as the ''King of the Noldor'', and had three sons and two daughters from two marriages.<ref name=\"S5\">{{S|5}}</ref>\n\nFinwë followed his eldest son [[Fëanor]] into exile at [[Formenos]],<ref>{{S|8}}</ref> and was killed by [[Morgoth|Melkor]] following the [[Darkening of Valinor]]. Following his father's death, [[Fëanor]] returned to Tirion even though the Valar had not lifted his exile and claimed the kingship of the Noldor. This cast Fëanor's inheritance of the kingship into question, but the rhetorical skill of Fëanor convinced the majority of the Noldor to follow him in his [[Flight of the Noldor|rebellion]] against the Valar, although some loved [[Fingolfin]] more.<ref name=\"S9\">{{S|9}}</ref>\n\n===Kingship splits===\nAfter the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë]], the youngest son of Finwë, [[Finarfin]], repented of the rebellion and was permitted to return to Tirion because his people had played no part in the Kinslaying. He remained in [[Tirion]] and ruled the Noldor who remained in [[Aman]].<ref>{{S|Index}}, ''Finarfin''</ref> However, the hosts of Fëanor, the primary instigator of the Kinslaying, and Fingolfin, some of whose people were late participants in it, continued towards Middle-earth.<ref name=\"S9\" />\n\n===Arrival in Middle-earth===\nThe hosts of Fëanor and Fingolfin arrived in Middle-earth separately, following Fëanor's betrayal of his half-brother by burning their captured fleet at [[Losgar]], with Fëanor arriving first. Fëanor, while calling himself King of the Noldor, was killed in the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]] before he was able to establish a realm. His eldest son, [[Maedhros]], inherited the claim to the kingship, but was soon after captured by Morgoth.<ref name=\"S13\">{{S|13}}</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\n{{main|High King of the Noldor}}\nThe arrival of the host of Fingolfin, battered by the crossing of the [[Helcaraxë|Grinding Ice]], complicated matters, as Fëanor's betrayal had driven a rift between the two hosts. This was resolved by [[Fingon]], son of Fingolfin, rescuing Maedhros from his captivity in [[Thangorodrim]]. Maedhros subsequently apologized for the burning of the ships and ceded his claim to the kingship, and that of the entire [[House of Fëanor]], to Fingolfin and his [[House of Fingolfin|House]], despite the disagreement of [[Sons of Feanor|his brothers]]. Thus the Kingship passed to the [[House of Fingolfin]], fulfilling the [[Doom of Mandos]] according to which the [[House of Fëanor]] would become the ''Dispossessed''.<ref name=\"S13\"/>\n\nWith the establishment of many different Noldorin realms, Fingolfin soon became '''[[High King of the Noldor]]'''. Following Fingolfin's death in the [[Dagor Bragollach]], the title passed to his son [[Fingon]].<ref name=\"S18\">{{S|18}}</ref> Following Fingon's death in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], the title passed to his younger brother [[Turgon]].<ref>{{S|20}}</ref> After Turgon's death in the [[Fall of Gondolin]], the last Noldorin realm in [[Beleriand]] was extinguished along with the House of Fingolfin in the male line.\n\nThe High Kingship passed to the [[House of Finarfin]]'s last living dynast, the young [[Ereinion Gil-galad]], son of [[Orodreth]].<ref>{{S|23}}</ref> Gil-galad was High King through the [[Second Age]] until his death in the [[War of the Last Alliance]] but sired no heirs. He was the last High King of the Noldor; his death meant the extinction of the entire [[House of Finwë]] in the male line in Middle-earth and afterwards, the office was left vacant.\n\nIn the Third Age, the House of Finwë survived in Middle-earth only in the female line, in the persons of [[Galadriel]], [[Elrond]], their descendants, and the descendants of [[Elros]]. Upon the departure of the bearers of the Three Rings at the dawn of the Fourth Age, the line of the High-elven kings, including the High Kings of the Noldor, was alone preserved in the descendants of [[Elros]] and [[Elrond]].<ref>{{App|A1i}}</ref>\n\n==List of Kings==\n===King of the Noldor in Valinor===\nThe first two kings were not distinguished as being ''in Valinor'', since the entire population of the Noldor lived in Valinor at that time.<ref name=\"S5\"/>\n\n# [[Finwë]], first King of the Noldor.\n# [[Fëanor]], the first son of Finwë; claimed the title after his father's death.\n# [[Finarfin]], third son of Finwë; remained in [[Aman]] after the [[Exile of the Noldor]] and ruled the remnant of his people in [[Tirion]].\n\n===High King of the Noldor in Middle-earth===\n[[Fëanor]] nominally ruled in [[Middle-earth]] for a short time before his fall in the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]], although he never officially claimed this title and never established a realm.\n# [[Fingolfin]], second son of Finwë; held to be the first '''[[High King of the Noldor]]''' by the majority of the Noldor after Maedhros son of Fëanor gave up his claims.<ref name=\"S13\"/>\n# [[Fingon]], first son of Fingolfin.\n# [[Turgon]], second son of Fingolfin.\n# [[Gil-galad]], great-grandson of Finarfin.\n\n== Etymology ==\nBeing king of the Noldor, Finwë was styled as '''''Ñoldóran''''',<ref name=\"Descendants\"/> which is a compound of ''[[noldo|Ñoldo]]'' and ''[[aran]]'' 'king', where ''o''+''a'' assimilated into a long ''ó''.<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3561596031.html|articlename=Q.
