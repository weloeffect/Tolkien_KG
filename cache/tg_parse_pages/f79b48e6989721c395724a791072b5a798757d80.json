It is, apart from Annúminas that is infested with [[Orcs]] and [[Angmar|Agmarim]], the main city of the region [[Evendim]].\n\n==Despcription==\nIt was probally built during the glorydays of [[Arnor]], along side the city Annúminas, but now it is inhabited by the few Rangers of the North that still remain. The Ranger Calengad is the leader of the city.\n\nIt is split into two parts: in the front, when you enter by the bridge, you see the camp, where most of the Rangers are. Here is also the skirmish and the stable master. Northwards, there is the building that is know as the Keep of Tinnidur. Here are the merchants and the citizens.<ref>{{LOTROW|Tinnudir|2025-08-13}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Tinnidur'' comes from ''[[tinnu]]'' which could come from the same root as ''[[Tinúviel]]'', meaning \"Twilight\".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry TIN, SEL-D</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings Online locations]]"}}}
