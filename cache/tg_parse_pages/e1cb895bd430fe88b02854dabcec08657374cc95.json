Holman informed him that Bilbo had gone on one of his walks, as it was the [[Elves]]' [[Yestare|new year]]. Holman's description of Bilbo convinced Gandalf he had found the perfect man for his [[Quest for Erebor|mission]], to re-take [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]].<ref name=\"Quest\">{{UT|Erebor}}</ref>\n\nWhen Bilbo went missing - that is, on his mission - Holman and Hamfast had their hands full in making sure the garden wasn't trampled as the place was swarming with Hobbits, hoping to get a piece of the Baggins estate.<ref name=\"Party\"/>\n\nThe Gaffer took over the job around {{TA|2961}},<ref>{{FR|Party}}: \"[Gaffer Gamgee] had tended the garden at Bag End for forty years\"</ref> about which time Holman retired or died.\n\nHolman was mentioned by the Gaffer to [[Ted Sandyman]], in a conversation which took place at a small inn on the Bywater road called [[The Ivy Bush]], in the year [[T.A. 3001]]; it was during this conversation that the Gaffer mentioned his relation to Holman (\"him being my dad's cousin\").<ref name=\"Party\" />\n\n==Etymology==\nHolman means \"hole-man\", and is distinct from the real-life English surname<ref name=\"Nomen\">{{HM|N}}, p. 760</ref> which contains ''holm'' \"river island\" rather than ''hol'' \"hole\".<ref>[[Jim Allan]] (ed.), ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', \"Giving of Names\"</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in Adaptation==\n'''2003: [[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|''The Hobbit'' (2003 video game)]]:'''\n:Holman lives in a hut on the other side of [[the Water]]. \n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Hobbits]][[Category:Greenhand]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[de:Holman Grünhand]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/hobbits/la mainverte/holman la mainverte 2]]\n[[fi:Kololainen Viherpeukalo]]"}}}
