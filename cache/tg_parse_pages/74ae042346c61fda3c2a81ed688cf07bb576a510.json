Deep within a wood of black trees stood a single great stone to mark the way, and beyond that, among the roots of the Dwimorberg, lay the Dark Door of [[Oathbreakers|The Dead]].<ref>{{RK|V2}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word is supposed to be [[Rohanese]] and the element ''dim'' has the archaic sense \"obscure, secret\". ''Holt'' means \"wood\" in occasional poetic use (also seen in the name ''[[Everholt]]''), with a cognate in German \"Holz\" meaning 'wood, lumber'.<ref name=\"Nomen\">{{HM|N}}, p. 768</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2013: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Dimholt lies on the edge of the [[Firienfeld]]. The wood is devoid of animals, who are avoiding the [[Dark Door]].\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Forests]]\n[[Category:Rohan]]\n[[de:Dimholt]]\n[[fr:encyclo:geographie:forets:rohan:dimholt]]\n[[fi:Dimholt]]"}}}
