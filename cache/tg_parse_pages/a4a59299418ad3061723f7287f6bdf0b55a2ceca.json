sun|[[The Flight of the Noldoli from Valinor]], vv.1-2}}\n\nThe '''Two Trees of Valinor''' were '''[[Telperion]]''' and '''[[Laurelin]]''', the Silver Tree and the Gold Tree that brought [[Light of Valinor|Light]] to the Land of the [[Valar]] in ancient times. They were destroyed by [[Morgoth|Melkor]] and [[Ungoliant]], but their last flower and fruit were made by the Valar into the [[Moon]] and the [[Sun]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Creation and characteristics ===\nThe first sources of light for all of [[Arda]] were two enormous [[Two Lamps|Lamps]], [[Illuin]], the silver one to the north and [[Ormal]], the golden one to the south. These were cast down and destroyed by [[Morgoth|Melkor]]. Afterward, the Valar went to [[Valinor]] and [[Yavanna]] sang into existence the Two Trees, silver [[Telperion]] and golden [[Laurelin]]. Telperion was considered male and Laurelin female. The Trees sat on the hill [[Ezellohar]] located just outside the western gates of [[Valimar]]. They grew in the presence of all of the [[Valar]], watered by the tears of [[Nienna]].<ref name=Days>{{S|1}}</ref>\n\nEach tree was a source of light: Telperion's silver and Laurelin's gold. Telperion had dark leaves (silver on one side) and his silvery dew was collected as a source of water and of light. Laurelin had gold-trimmed leaves and her dew was likewise collected by [[Varda]].\n\nThe Count of [[Time]] and the [[Years of the Trees]] began with the first light of Telperion. One \"day\" lasted twelve hours. Each Tree, in turn, would give off light for seven hours (waxing to full brightness and then slowly waning again), so that at one hour each of \"dawn\" and \"dusk\" soft gold and silver light would be given off together.<ref name=Days />\n\n=== Destruction ===\n[[File:Luis F. Bejarano - The Darkening of Valinor.jpg|left|thumb|220px|\"The Darkening of Valinor\" by [[Luis F. Bejarano]]]]{{main|Darkening of Valinor}}\n\nA jealous [[Morgoth|Melkor]] enlisted the help of the giant spider-creature [[Ungoliant]] (an ancestress of [[Shelob]]) to destroy the Two Trees. Concealed in a cloud of darkness, the two of them struck during a [[high feast]]. The [[Unlight]] of Ungoliant devoured the roots, while Melkor came onto Ezellohar, striking both Trees with his black spear. The sap of the Two Trees poured like blood upon Ezellohar where insatiable Ungoliant sucked it up, devouring whatever life and light remained before draining the [[Wells of Varda]].<ref>{{S|Darkening}}</ref>\n\nAfter Melkor and Ungoliant fled, Yavanna came onto Ezellohar, only to find that the Trees were dead, and their light lived on only within [[Fëanor|Fëanor's]] three [[Silmarils]], which he refused to break to restore the Two Trees.<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref>\n\n[[Yavanna]] sang and [[Nienna]] wept, yet they eventually succeeded only in reviving Telperion's last flower (to become the [[Moon]]) and Laurelin's last fruit (to become the [[Sun]]). These were assigned to [[Maiar|lesser spirits]], [[Tilion]] and [[Arien]], respectively.<ref>{{S|11}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the true light of the Trees, before their poisoning by Ungoliant, was said to now reside only in the [[Silmarils]].<ref>{{S|9}}</ref><ref>{{S|23}}</ref> It is said that according to the [[Second Prophecy of Mandos]], after the breaking of the Earth, the light of the Silmarils will be used by Yavanna to rekindle the Two Trees, which will light all the world.<ref>{{LR|P2VI}}, p. 333</ref>\n\n== Legacy == \nThe imagery of the Two Trees is used by the Eldar in their arts, either in poetry (like [[Elemmírë]]'s ''[[Aldudénië]]'') or crafts. Especially renowned were the images wrought by [[Turgon]], named [[Glingal and Belthil]].<ref>{{S|15}}</ref>\n\nThe Two Trees of Valinor existed at a time when the only other sources of light were the stars (which had been created for the Elves' benefit by [[Varda]] from the dews collected from the Two Trees). When three Elven ambassadors were brought to see Valinor for themselves, in order that the Elves might be convinced to come to Valinor, it seems that the Two Trees affected them most significantly.<ref>{{S|3}}</ref>\n\nIn particular [[Thingol]] seems to have been motivated in the [[Great Journey]] by his desire to see the [[Light of Valinor]] again (until he found contentment in the light he saw in [[Melian]]'s face). Also in later times, the Elves would be divided between the ''[[Calaquendi]]'' who had seen the light of the Trees, and the ''[[Moriquendi]]'' who had not, with the former group explicitly superior in many ways.\n\nIn the [[Second Age|Second]] and [[Third Age|Third]] Ages, the [[White Tree]]s of Númenor and of Gondor, whose likeness descends from that of Telperion, had a mostly symbolic significance. They stood both as symbols of the kingdoms in question, and also as reminders of the ancestral alliance between the [[Dúnedain]] and the Elves.\n\nIn the Elvish ''[[enquië]]'' (week), the fourth day was named ''[[Aldúya]]'' in [[Quenya]] and ''[[Orgaladhad]]'' in [[Sindarin]], dedicated to the Two Trees.<ref>{{App|D2}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n''See:'' \n*''[[Telperion#Etymology|Telperion: Etymology]] and [[Telperion#Other names|Telperion: Other names]]''\n*''[[Laurelin#Etymology|Laurelin: Etymology]] and [[Laurelin#Other names|Laurelin: Other names]]''\n\nThe pair of the trees was perhaps referred to as '''''Aldu''''' in [[Quenya]], the dual form of ''[[alda]]''. The word as such appears in the names of the weekday name ''[[Aldúya|'''Aldú'''ya]]'' (\"Day of the Two Trees\") and ''[[Aldudénië|'''Aldu'''dénië]]'' (\"Lament for the Trees\").<ref>{{webcite|website=Arda|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/quen-eng.htm|articlename=Quettaparma Quenyallo}}</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nThe concept of the Two Trees is present since the earliest writings of the legendarium, as in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. In that continuity, the Elves maintained a prophecy concerning their rekindling and return to [[Luthany]] in historical times. In the [[Cottage of Lost Play]] the Elves toasted \"to the rekindling of the [[Magic Sun]]\" which [[Christopher Tolkien]] interprets as an expectation of the future event.<ref>{{LTII|VI}}, p. 286</ref><ref>{{LT1|III}}</ref> Before Yavanna tried to heal the Trees (after [[Melko]] destroyed them, before the Sun and Moon were made), she warned that a very long time will pass before the glow of the Trees or the Magic Sun will be seen again, although this name was not known yet.<ref>{{LT1|VIII}}</ref>\n\nIn Tolkien's latest writings in which Arda was a [[Round World version of the Silmarillion|round world]] from its beginning, the Two Trees held the light of the untainted Sun rather than the light of the Two Lamps, which in this history never existed. They still lit the darkened world during the Years of the Trees, though in this history the darkness came from Melkor's sorceries rather than the absence of a Sun or Moon.<ref>{{MR|P5II}}, pp. 375-385</ref>\n\n== Inspiration ==\nIn an [[1965 BBC Interview|interview]], Tolkien was asked if Laurelin and Telperion were a reflection of the [[:Wikipedia:Yggdrasil|Tree of the World]] in [[Norse mythology]], but he denied it, saying that they were more like the trees of the sun and moon in the tales of Alexander the Great.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Denys Gueroult]]|articleurl=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p021jx7j|articlename=Author Archive Collection: J.R.R. Tolkien|dated=|website=BBC Radio|accessed=12 May 2021}}, minute 4:11</ref> [[Michael Martinez]] explains: \n\n{{blockquote|there is a legend of two cypress trees, the Trees of the Sun and Moon, that are said to have been planted by Zoroaster himself. Alexander the Great, hearing of these trees, visited them when he conquered Persia. He asked the oracle of the trees what his future would be. The oracle told him that he would go on to conquer India but that he would then die soon afterward. In some versions of the legend the trees themselves speak to Alexander. According to Marco Polo, the Khalif Motawakkil had one of the trees cut down in the 9th Century CE (when the tree was said to be 1450 years old) and sent to Baghdad. The Khalif was subsequently murdered by his own guards (Cf. The Book of Ser by Marco Polo, the Venetian).''}}\n\nAlthough there is no direct connection between J.R.R. Tolkien and Marco Polo, Martinez was informed by [[Jane Chance]] that Tolkien knew well the [[Middle English]] poem \"[[:Wikipedia:Kyng Alisaunder|Kyng Alisaunder]]\", which includes the tale of the trees.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Michael Martinez]]|articleurl=http://middle-earth.xenite.org/2011/11/29/is-there-a-source-for-the-tale-of-the-two-trees/|articlename=Is There a Source for the Tale of the Two Trees?|dated=29 November 2011|website=[http://middle-earth.xenite.org/ Middle-earth.Xenite.org]|accessed=31 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n[[Clyde S. Kilby]] also notices that the Two Trees follow the Biblical pattern of the original [[Light]], which existed prior to the Sun and Moon. Many authors, like Milton in his ''Paradise Lost'', believed there was a long period of time between the two kind of lights.<ref>[[Clyde S. Kilby]], ''[[Tolkien and The Silmarillion]]'', \"Tolkien as a Christian author\", pp. 59-60</ref>\n\n== Portrayal in adaptations ==\n[[File:The Rings of Power (TV series) - Two Trees of Valinor.png|thumb|The Two Trees of Valinor in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]''.]]\n\n'''2022: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'', Season 1:'''\n:'''Episode 1: ''[[A Shadow of the Past]]'':'''\n::When the Two Trees were said by [[Galadriel]] to have been slain by [[Morgoth]], [[Ungoliant]]'s role is not mentioned. In addition, the method of how Morgoth killed them is not depicted. Rather than being killed by Morgoth with a black spear, the trees instead burn to death under a shadow of Morgoth.\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[Aldudénië]]''\n* [[Light of Valinor]]\n\n{{References}}\n{{cosmology}}\n[[Category:Creations of the Valar]]\n[[Category:Trees]]\n[[Category:Valinor]]\n[[de:Zwei Bäume]]\n[[fi:Valinorin Kaksi puuta]]\n[[fr:encyclo:biologie:flore:deux arbres]]"}}}
