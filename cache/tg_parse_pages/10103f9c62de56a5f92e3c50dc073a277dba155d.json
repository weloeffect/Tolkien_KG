Tolkien]], edited by [[Carl F. Hostetter]] and published in [[2021]] in a single book.\n\nIts many texts discuss a variety of topics related to [[Middle-earth]], such as its \"nature\" and landscapes, the characteristics of different [[Portal:Characters|races]], theology, and many other miscellaneous matters in Tolkien's [[legendarium]]. Most of these writings were previously [[unpublished material]], but some had been already published in the linguistic journals ''[[Parma Eldalamberon]]'' and ''[[Vinyar Tengwar]]''.\n\n==From the publisher==\n{{blockquote|The first ever publication of J.R.R. Tolkien's final writings on [[Middle-earth]], covering a wide-range of subjects, and the perfect next read for those who have enjoyed ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' and the ''[[The History of Middle-earth|History of Middle-earth]]'' series and are hungry for more.}}\n\n{{blockquote|''The Nature of Middle-earth'' comprises numerous late (c. 1959-73) and previously unpublished writings by J.R.R. Tolkien on the \"nature\" of Middle-earth, in both chief senses of that word: both metaphysical and natural/historical.<br>\nIt is for Tolkien fans, readers, and scholars interested in learning more about Tolkien's own views on Middle-earth. It will appeal in particular to those readers who enjoyed ''Unfinished Tales'', and some of the later volumes of the ''History of Middle-earth''. Indeed, many of the texts to be included are closely associated with materials published in those places, and were sent to Hostetter, specifically, in photocopy by [[Christopher Tolkien]] for potential publication.<br>\nMuch as ''Unfinished Tales'' forms an unofficial thirteenth volume of the ''History of Middle-earth'', this new book will sit very nicely alongside as an unofficial 14th volume. Of particular note, given the impending [[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power‎|Amazon series]], are several texts detailing the lands, flora, and fauna of [[Númenor]], and the lives of [[Númenóreans]].<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://harpercollins.co.uk/products/the-nature-of-middle-earth-j-r-r-tolkien?variant=39278611365966|articlename=The Nature of Middle-earth|website=HarperCollins|accessed=1 September 2021}}</ref>}}\n\n==Contents==\n<div style=\"-moz-column-width: 400px; -webkit-column-width: 400px; column-width: 400px; -moz-column-gap: 15px; -webkit-column-gap: 15px; column-gap: 15px; -webkit-column-rule: 1px solid #cccccc; -moz-column-rule: 1px solid #cccccc; column-rule: 1px solid #cccccc;\">\n*Foreword\n*Editorial Practices\n\n*'''Part One: Time and Ageing'''\n**Introduction\n*#The Valian Year\n*#Valinorian Time-Divisions\n*#Of the Time in Arda\n*#Time-scales\n*#Natural Youth and Growth of the Quendi\n*#The Awaking of the Quendi\n*#The March of the Quendi\n*#Eldarin Traditions Concerning the \"Awakening\"\n*#Time-scales and Rates of Growth\n*#Difficulties in Chronology\n*#Ageing of Elves\n*#Concerning the Quendi in their Mode of Life and Growth\n*#Key Dates\n*#Calculation of the Increase of the Quendi\n*#A Generational Scheme\n*#Note on the Youth of Growth of the Quendi\n*#Generational Schemes\n*#Elvish Ages & Númenórean\n*#Elvish Life-cycles\n*#Time and its Perception\n*#Notes on Elvish Time-reference\n*#[[The Annals of Aman|A Fragment from ''The Annals of Aman'']]\n*#[[The Grey Annals|A Fragment from ''The Grey Annals'']]\n\n*'''Part Two: Body, Mind, and Spirit'''\n**Introduction\n*#Beauty and Goodness\n*#Gender and Sex\n*#Eldarin Hands, Fingers, and Numerals\n*#Hair\n*#Beards\n*#Descriptions of Characters\n*#Mind-Pictures\n*#Knowledge and Memory\n*#''[[Ósanwe-kenta]]''\n*#Notes on ''Órë''\n*#[[Fate and Free Will]]\n*#The Knowledge of the Valar\n*#Spirit\n*#The Visible Forms of the Valar and Maiar\n*#Elvish Reincarnation\n*#From ''The Statute of Finwë and Míriel''\n*#Death\n\n*'''Part Three: The World, its Lands, and its Inhabitants'''\n**Introduction\n*#Dark and Light\n*#The Primal Impulse\n*#Powers of the Valar\n*#The Making of ''Lembas''\n*#Note on Elvish Economy\n*#Dwellings in Middle-earth\n*#The Founding of Nargothrond\n*#Manwë's Ban\n*#Elvish Journeys on Horseback\n*#Rider to \"The White Rider\"\n*#Lives of the Númenóreans\n*#The Ageing of Númenóreans\n*#Of the Land and Beasts of Númenor\n*#Note on the Consumption of Mushrooms\n*#The Númenórean Catastrophe & End of \"Physical\" Aman\n*#Galadriel and Celeborn\n*#Silvan Elves and Silvan Elvish\n*#Note on the Delay of Gil-galad and the Númenóreans\n*#Note on Dwarvish Voices\n*#Note on the Dwarf Road\n*#[[The Hunt for the Ring|From ''The Hunt for the Ring'']]\n*#[[The Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor]]\n\n*'''Appendices'''\n**Metaphysical and Theological Themes\n**Glossary and Index of Quenya Terms\n\n*Index\n</div>\n\n==Publication history and gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"125px\" heights=\"125px\">\nFile:The Nature of Middle-earth hardcover.jpg|2021 hardcover\nFile:The Nature of Middle-earth deluxe.jpeg|2021 hardcover deluxe edition\nFile:The Nature of Middle-earth 2023.jpg|2023 paperback\nFile:The Nature of Middle-earth 2025.jpg|2025 paperback\n</gallery>\n*[[HarperCollins]] hardcover ([[2021]]), pp.&nbsp;464.
