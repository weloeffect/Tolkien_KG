Celegorm and Curufin, their own Oath now reawakened, both spoke against Finrod. Celegorm, drawing his sword, spoke first and declared that the Silmarils belonged only to Fëanor's sons, and that even should the quest be achieved they would slay any that kept the Silmaril or gave it to any hands but their own. Curufin spoke next, more softly but with no less power, of war and the ruin of Nargothrond, and instilled such fear in the hearts of the Elves that they refused to obey their king or go into open battle until the time of Túrin, forgetting all bonds of kinship.  In their hearts, Celegorm and Curufin thought to send Finrod to his death so that they could usurp his throne.  Finrod, forsaken, then gave his crown to Orodreth to govern in his stead and left with Beren and only ten other companions. With Finrod gone, Celegorm and Curufin further swayed the hearts of the people of Nargothrond, and Orodreth had no power to withstand them.

Returned to power, Orodreth would not let Celegorm and Curufin be slain, and instead expelled them from Nargothrond.

While Celegorm charged at Beren, Curufin, being a strong and cunning horseman, captured Lúthien.  As Curufin passed by, he was caught from behind at the throat by the [[Leap of Beren]], and hurled to the ground.  Beren then proceeded to throttle Curufin while Celegorm was held at bay by Huan who had finally forsook the service of Celegorm. Lúthien forbid Beren to slay Curufin, so instead Beren stripped Curufin of his gear and weapons, including his knife Angrist, before flinging him away.  Beren further claimed Curufin's horse, bidding Curufin to walk back to his kinsfolk.  Curufin cursed Beren to \"Go hence unto a swift and bitter death\" before joining Celegorm on his horse and they made as if to ride away.  Filled with shame and malice, Curufin took Celegorm's bow and shot two arrows at Lúthien; Huan caught the first in his mouth while the second hit Beren in the breast when he sprang in front of Lúthien.
