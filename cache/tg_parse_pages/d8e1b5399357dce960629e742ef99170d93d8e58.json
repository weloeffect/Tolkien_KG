In time she became the leader of the [[Haladin]], one of the [[Edain#The Three Houses|Three Houses of the Edain]].\n\n== History ==\nIn {{FA|312}}, the Haladin crossed the [[Blue Mountains]], the second group of [[Men]] to do so. They settled in [[Thargelion]], the land of the [[Noldor|Elf]] Lord [[Caranthir]]. Though they dwelled in Caranthir's land, they did not swear allegiance to him and remained free men. After her father and her twin brother were slain in [[Battle of the Gelion-Ascar Stockade|a raid]] by [[Orcs]], Haleth became [[Chieftain of the Haladin]]. She kept her people alive for seven days while the Orcs laid siege to the encampment, until Caranthir finally arrived with reinforcements. Impressed with her bravery, he offered her a fiefdom in his land and the protection of his soldiers. Haleth, however, was proud and refused his offer.\n\nHaleth instead led her people to the relative safety of the [[Forest of Brethil]] in the lands of King [[Thingol]]. In exchange for defending the [[Crossing of Teiglin]], King [[Finrod]] made use of his friendship with Thingol to allow the Haladin to remain freemen. Years later, when Haleth died, her people raised a monument to her, the ''[[Haudh-en-Arwen]]''. While her father had been elected Chief of his people, the Haladin chose to establish a ruling line from the descendants of Haldad. Because Haleth did not marry and had no children, her brother's son [[Haldan]] became Chieftain of the Haladin.\n\nThe Haladin remained in the Forest of Brethil for the duration of the First Age, and in time were known as the '''[[House of Haleth]]'''.<ref>{{S|West}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''Haleth'' has no known meaning. In the language of the Haladin, ''hal'' means \"chief\" or \"guard\". [[Sindarin]] also has the feminine ending ''-eth''.\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| | | HAD | | |HAD=[[Haldad]]<br /><small>''{{FA|315}} - {{FA|375|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| |,|-|^|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree| HAT | | HAA |HAT='''HALETH'''<br /><small>''{{FA|341|n}} - {{FA|420|n}}''</small>|HAA=[[Haldar]]<br /><small>''{{FA|341|n}} - {{FA|375|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | | | |!| |}}\n{{familytree| | | | | HAN |HAN=[[Haldan]]<br /><small>''{{FA|366|n}} - {{FA|451|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | | | |!| |}}\n{{familytree| | | | | HAM |HAM=[[Halmir]]<br /><small>''{{FA|390|n}} - {{FA|471|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nIn [[The Quenta]], '''Haleth the Hunter''' was the son of [[Hador]] who first appears as one of the Fathers of Men.<ref>{{SM|Q9}}, p. 104.</ref> Later, he appeared as the leader of one of the Three Houses of Men,<ref>See e.g. {{GA|122}} (born in Eriador in F.A. 388); {{GA|129}} (comes into Beleriand with his people); {{GA|126}} (his son Hundor born in F.A. 413).</ref> until his character was reworked into Lady Haleth.<ref>{{WJ|14}}, p. 227-228.</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Haleth}}\n\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n|race=edain\n|house=Founded the [[House of Haleth]]\n|born={{FA|341}}\n|died={{FA|420}}\n}}\n{{seq\n|pvac=None\n|prev=New title\n|next=[[Haldan]]\n|list=[[Halad]]\n|dates={{FA|375}} - {{FA|420|n}}\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:Chieftains of the Haladin]]\n[[Category:Edain]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Halethian names]]\n[[Category:House of Haleth]]\n[[Category:Mannish words]]\n[[Category:Old English names]]\n\n[[de:Frau Haleth]]\n[[fi:Haleth (Haladinin johtaja)]]\n[[fr:encyclo:personnages:hommes:1a:peuple de haleth:haleth]]"}}}
