Tolkien]]'s writings, edited by his son [[Christopher Tolkien]] and published on [[17 April]] [[2007]]. The main text had been previously published as \"[[Narn i Hîn Húrin]]\" in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', here edited by Christopher to form a consistent narrative as an independent work. The first and most subsequent editions include illustrations by [[Alan Lee]].\n\nThe plot consists in the expanded account of the story of the wanderings and deeds of [[Túrin Turambar]], son of [[Húrin]], and his sister [[Niënor]], in their struggle against fate (and the curse cast upon Húrin's kin). It is considered to be among the darkest examples of any of Tolkien's works.\n\nThe story is one of three \"[[Atanatarion|great tales]]\" set in the [[First Age]] of Tolkien's [[Middle-earth]], the other two being ''[[Beren and Lúthien]]'' and ''[[The Fall of Gondolin]]''.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\"There are tales of Middle-earth from times long before ''The Lord of the Rings'', and the story told in this book is set in the great country that lay beyond the [[Grey Havens]] in the North: lands where [[Treebeard]] once walked, but which were drowned in the great cataclysm that ended the [[First Age]] of the World.\n\n\"In that remote time [[Morgoth]], the first Dark Lord, dwelt in the vast fortress of [[Angband]] in the North; and the tragedy of [[Túrin]] and his sister [[Niënor]] unfolded within the shadow of the fear of Angband and the war waged by Morgoth against the lands and secret cities of the Elves.\n\n\"Their brief and passionate lives were dominated by the elemental hatred that Morgoth bore them as the children of Húrin, the man who had dared to defy and to scorn him to his face. Against them he sent his formidable servant, [[Glaurung]], a powerful spirit in the form of a huge wingless [[dragon]] of fire. Into his story of brutal conquest and flight, of forest hiding-places and pursuit, of resistance with lessening hope, the mythological persons of the God and the Dragon enter in fearfully articulate form. Sardonic and mocking, Glaurung manipulated the fates of Túrin and Niënor by lies of diabolic cunning and guile, and the curse of Morgoth was fulfilled.\n\n\"The earliest versions of this story by J.R.R. Tolkien go back to the end of the First World War and the years that followed; but long afterwards, when ''The Lord of the Rings'' was finished, he wrote it anew and greatly enlarged it in complexities of motive and character: it became the dominant story in his later work on Middle-earth. But he could not bring it to final and finished form. In this book I have endeavoured to construct, after long study of the manuscripts, a coherent narrative without any editorial invention.\" <small>—Christopher Tolkien</small>\n\n==Contents==\n[[File:Alan Lee - Beleg Departs from Menegroth.jpg|thumb|''Beleg Departs from Menegroth'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]\n* Preface\n* Introduction\n* Note on Pronunciation\n\n* '''Narn I Chîn Húrin: The Tale of the Children of Húrin'''\n# \"[[The Childhood of Túrin]]\"\n# \"[[The Battle of Unnumbered Tears]]\"\n# \"[[The Words of Húrin and Morgoth]]\"\n# \"[[The Departure of Túrin]]\"\n# \"[[Túrin in Doriath]]\"\n# \"[[Túrin among the Outlaws]]\"\n# \"[[Of Mîm the Dwarf]]\"\n# \"[[The Land of Bow and Helm]]\"\n# \"[[The Death of Beleg]]\"\n# \"[[Túrin in Nargothrond]]\"\n# \"[[The Fall of Nargothrond]]\"\n# \"[[The Return of Túrin to Dor-lómin]]\"\n# \"[[The Coming of Túrin into Brethil]]\"\n# \"[[The Journey of Morwen and Niënor to Nargothrond]]\"\n# \"[[Niënor in Brethil]]\"\n# \"[[The Coming of Glaurung]]\"\n# \"[[The Death of Glaurung]]\"\n# \"[[The Death of Túrin]]\"\n\n* Genealogies\n** The House of Hador & the People of Haleth\n** The House of Bëor\n** The Princes of the Noldor\n* Appendix\n** The Evolution of the Great Tales\n** The Composition of the Text\n* List of Names\n* Note on the map\n\n==Writings and publication==\nA brief version of the story formed the base of [[Of Túrin Turambar|Chapter 21]] of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', setting the tale in the context of the wars of [[Beleriand]]. Although based on the same texts used to complete the new book, Christopher Tolkien abridged the tale to avoid overcharging his edition.\n\nOther incomplete versions have been published in previous publications:\n*The \"[[Narn i Hîn Húrin]]\" in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''.\n*Items in ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' series, including:\n**\"[[Turambar and the Foalókë]]\", from ''[[The Book of Lost Tales: Part Two]]''\n**\"[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]\" (a narrative poem), from ''[[The Lays of Beleriand]]''\nNone of these writings forms a complete and mature narrative. The published ''Children of Húrin'' is essentially a synthesis of the ''Narn'' and of the account found in ''The Silmarillion''.\n\n{{blockquote|It has seemed to me for a long time that there was a good case for presenting my father's long version of the legend of the Children of Húrin as an independent work, between its own covers, with a minimum of editorial presence, and above all in continuous narrative without gaps or interruptions, if this could be done without distortion or invention, despite the unfinished state in which he left some parts of it.|Christopher Tolkien}}\n\n==Publication history and gallery==\n;UK editions \n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"125px\" heights=\"125px\">\nFile:Children of Húrin 2007.png |2007 hardcover\nFile:Children-of-hurin-deluxe-edition-w-stamp.jpg |2007 hardcover deluxe edition [[The Children of Húrin: Deluxe Edition|<sup>1</sup>]]\nFile:The Children of Hurin Signed Limited Edition - 2.jpg |2007 hardcover limited deluxe [[The Children of Húrin Signed Limited Edition|<sup>2</sup>]]\nFile:Children of Húrin 2007 large.png |2007 hardcover large print\nFile:Children of Húrin 2008.jpeg |2008 paperback\nFile:Children of Húrin 2008 special 2.jpeg |2008 paperback overseas edition\nFile:Children of Húrin 2008 special.jpeg |2008 overseas 7th? impression\nFile:Children of Húrin 2014.png |2014 paperback\nFile:Children of Húrin 2014 large.png |2014 paperback large print\nFile:Children of Húrin 2024.png |2024 paperback\nFile:Children of Húrin 2007.png |2025 hardcover (boxed set)\n</gallery>\n* [[HarperCollins]] hardcover ([[2007]]), pp.&nbsp;320.
