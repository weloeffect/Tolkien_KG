It turned west beyond [[Ravenhill]] and then east and south to [[Long Lake]]<ref>{{H|Home}}</ref> and thence through the eastern outskirts of [[Mirkwood]],<ref name=\"Wilderland\">{{H|Wilderland}}</ref> then south east through apparently uninhabited regions of  [[Rhovanion]] to its confluence with the [[Carnen]] and finally in a long south-eastward loop to the great inland [[Sea of Rhûn]],<ref name=\"Rhun\">{{UT|Map}}</ref> past the land of [[Dorwinion]].<ref>{{HM|Map}}</ref>  \n\nThe Celduin had three tributaries: the [[Forest River]], which flowed into the Long Lake from the west; a small unnamed river that flowed from the [[Mountains of Mirkwood]] to join the Celduin just north of the [[Old Forest Road]];<ref name=\"Wilderland\"/> and the Carnen, which entered the Celduin from the northeast about halfway between Mirkwood and the Sea of Rhûn.<ref name=\"Rhun\"/> Its course then ended in the [[Sea of Rhûn]].<ref>{{UT|Index}}</ref><ref group=note>None of the known maps make clear what the name of the river was from the confluence of the Celduin and the Carnen to the Sea of Rhûn. In the Index to the ''Unfinished Tales'' [[Christopher Tolkien]] says: \"'Redwater', river flowing down from the Iron Hills to join the River Running\" and the ''Celduin'': \"River flowing from the Lonely Mountain '''to the Sea of Rhûn'''\". If taken literally, these statements support that ''Celduin'' flowed to the Sea and the Carnen was but one of its tributaries.</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn the thirteenth century of the [[Third Age]] the Celduin had formed the northeast border of the lands of [[Vidugavia]].<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>  During the [[Great Plague]] of {{TA|1636}}<ref name=\"TA\">{{App|TA}}</ref> more than half of the people of Rhovanion died and when the [[Wainriders]] invaded from the east (beginning in {{TA|1851|n}}<ref name=\"TA\"/>) the remaining [[Northmen]] in the region fled across the Celduin and merged with the folk of [[Dale]].<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, (i) ''The Northmen and the Wainriders''</ref>  After the threat of the Wainriders ended some of the Northmen drifted back along the banks of the Celduin but when [[Cirion]] became the Steward of [[Gondor]] he learned that new [[Easterlings]] were again driving the remnant of the Northmen up the Celduin.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, (ii) ''The Ride of Eorl''</ref>  \n\nBetween the time when [[Thráin I]] founded the dwarf-kingdom in the Lonely Mountain (in {{TA|1999|n}}) and the arrival of [[Smaug]] (in {{TA|2770|n}})<ref name=\"TA\"/> the Northmen living between the Celduin and Carnen grew strong and repelled all eastern enemies.<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>  Even after the arrival of the dragon at the Lonely Mountain the Celduin was still a highway of trade for [[Thranduil]]'s kingdom, the town of [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]], and places to the south.<ref>{{H|Welcome}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn the earliest version of the map that would become [[Thrór's Map]] in ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the River Running flowed nearly due east from the ruins of Dale. On this map [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] scratched out the eastward flow and put in the bend to the Long Lake, stressing the change with an arrow.<ref>{{HH|Pryftan}}, p. 18</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - River Running.jpg|thumb|250px|left|River Running in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2018: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The origin of River Running can be found within [[Erebor]] itself, where it flows in a channel before exiting the mountain.\n\n{{references|n}}\n{{companyroute}}\n[[Category:Rhovanion]]\n[[Category:Rivers]]\n[[de:Celduin]]\n[[fi:Celduin]]\n[[fr:encyclo:geographie:eaux:rhovanion:celduin]]"}}}
