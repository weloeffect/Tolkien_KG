The most significant peak was [[Weathertop]]/Amon Sûl, lay at the southern end of the range adjacent to the [[Great East Road]]. \n==History==\nIn the early [[Second Age]] the Weather Hills were occupied by [[Middle Men]], as well as the [[North Downs]] and [[Lake Evendim]].<ref>{{PM|Atani}}</ref> In the year {{SA|600}} [[Vëantur]] first returned to [[Middle-earth]] from [[Númenor]].<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}</ref> Upon hearing that some of their distant kin had come, these [[Middle Men]] petitioned [[Gil-galad]] to meet the mariners. Twelve men came and rejoiced to meet the Númenóreans.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}, Note 3</ref>\n\nIt marked part of the border between the lands of [[Arthedain]] and [[Rhudaur]]. When [[Angmar]] was formed and Rhudaur became hostile to Arthedain, [[Argeleb I]] fortified the range but after the enemies laid siege to the Hills, Argeleb fell ({{TA|1356}}).\n\nWith the help of [[Cardolan]] and [[Elves of Lindon|Lindon]], [[Arveleg I]] drove out the enemies from the Hills and Arnor kept a guarded border along the Weather Hills, the East Road and the lower Hoarwell. \n\nIn {{TA|1409}}, Angmar and Rhudaur crossed the Hoarwell, occupied Cardolan, and closed in on Weathertop.\n\nMarks of this fortification still existed in the path [[Aragorn]] led the hobbits on to reach Weathertop.\n\n==Inspiration==\nPossibly the Lickey Hills, Worcestershire, England:\n{{quote|The boys [Ronald and Hilary] had the freedom of these grounds [Rednal, Worcestershire], and further afield they could roam the steep paths that led through the trees to the high Lickey Hill[s?]|[[J.R.R.

A small river originated in the dell of Bleakrift a short distance north-west of [[Weathertop]] and flowed south-west into the [[Midgewater Marshes]]. The Midgewater Pass crossed this river, allowing passage into the hills north of the [[East Road]]. During the [[War of the Ring]], the hills were infested with [[orcs]], goblins, [[half-orcs]] and [[wargs]] both from [[Angmar]] and from [[Isengard]]. The [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]] Candaith watched over the hills before travelling south as part of the [[Grey Company]].\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Arnor]]\n[[Category:Eriador]]\n[[Category:Hills]]"}}}
