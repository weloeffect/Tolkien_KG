[[Varda]] proposed to gather all the remaining light that flowed in the airs and in the earth, as she wished to make a beacon with it upon [[Taniquetil]]. [[Manwë]] did not wish that the light was gleaned from the sky, so [[Ulmo]] was in charge of gathering all the flowing light from the lakes and rivers, and brought them to [[Valinor]]. In the gloom, [[Aulë]] made two great cauldrons, which were Kulullin and Silindrin. The Valar dug two great pits in the midmost vale of their lands, and buried there many magical things, creating two mounds. To water them, the Valar placed next to them the two cauldrons, Kulullin being of golden light and Silindrin of silver. When [[Palúrien]] brought forth [[Laurelin]] and [[Silpion]] from the mounds, she explained to the Gods that the cauldrons had to be filled with the light pouring from the trees, while the trees had to be watered with the light of the cauldrons. \"''Light is the sap of these trees and their sap is light!''\".<ref>{{LT1|III}}, pp. 70-73</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Kulullin'' is [[Qenya]] for \"Gold-song\".<ref>{{PE|13}}, p. 103</ref>\n\n''Silindrin'' is Qenya for \"Moon-cauldron\".<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry \"Silindrin\"</ref> [[Tolkien]] first named this cauldron ''Telimpë'', but soon changed it to ''Silindrin'', although this previous name is curiously used again in narrative.<ref>{{HM|LT1}}, pp. 79, 129-130</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Creations of the Valar]]"}}}
