Tolkien]]'s \"[[Goblin Feet]]\"). Eventually, she became a prolific writer of books and articles, including ''Graeme and the Dragon'' ([[1954]], illustrated by [[Pauline Baynes]]) and ''[[To the Chapel Perilous]]'' ([[1955]], which Tolkien disliked).<ref name=RG/>\n\nFor many years, Mitchison was a fan of Tolkien's works, and they had a long-time correspondance. She became a proofreader of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' when [[George Allen and Unwin|George Allen & Unwin]] sent her advance proofs of the first two volumes. Of ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Mitchison wrote \"It is timeless and will go on\".<ref>Quoted by D.M.S. in \"Recent Readings\", in the journal ''English'' 1956, 11, p. 31</ref> Upon the release of the volume, she wrote the article \"One Ring to Bind Them\" in ''[[Wikipedia:New Statesman|New Statesman and Nation]]'' ([[18 September]] [[1954]]) reviewing the book. Although she criticised some vague aspects, and scientific uncertainties of the Secondary World, she praised its geographic, cultural, historical and linguistic depth.<ref>Quoted in {{HM|RC}}, p. xxxvi</ref>\n\nHowever, later in life she became increasingly critical of Tolkien's works, critizing the \"grandiose style\" of ''[[The Return of the King]]'' and the lack of a feminine perspective in ''The Lord of the Rings'' and finding ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' simplistic.<ref name=RG>{{CG|RG}}, pp. 592-3</ref>\n\n==Bibliography, selected==\n\n===Articles===\n* [[1954]]: ''New Statesman and Nation'', 18 September\n** \"One Ring to Bind Them\" [Review of ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'']\n* [[1967]]: ''Glasgow Herald'', 25 November\n** \"Why Not Grown-ups Too?\" [Review of ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]'']\n* [[1977]]: ''Books and Bookmen'', October\n** \"Maps of Middle Earth\" [Review of ''[[J.R.R.
