When the first [[Edain]] newly arrived in [[Beleriand]] and disputed whether or not to remain, they referred to the Valar as gods in the [[Uttermost West|West]].<ref>{{S|Men}}</ref> They had not at this point been tutored by the [[Elves]] in such high matters.\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] states that Men have 'often' called the Valar gods, in fact the term is very rare in his later books. This is more prominent in the earliest version of the legendarium where the Ainur display more common characteristics to mythological deities, such as having offspring. The word ''Aino'' is glossed as \"god\",<ref>{{PE|15}}, p. 72</ref> whereas in the earlier ''[[Qenya Lexicon]]'', the words ''ainu'' (m.) and ''aini'' (f.) are glossed as \"a pagan god\" and \"goddess\". Note however that in published [[Appendix E]] the word ''ainu'' is glossed as \"holy one\".\n\nAnother example are [[Ælfwine]]'s translations into [[Old English]]; he referred to the Valar as ''[[Wiktionary:frea|frēan]]'' (\"lords\") or ''[[Wiktionary:os#Old English|ēse]]'' (\"gods\").<ref>{{SM|QA1}}</ref>\n\nIt is tempting to suppose that the term \"gods\" suggests equivalences between the Valar and mythological gods of later times.\n\nIn ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', [[Nan Dungortheb|Nan Dumgorthin]], the \"Land of the Dark Idols\" ''\"(dum ‘secret, not to be spoken’, dumgort, dungort ‘an (evil) idol’)\"'', was a dark forested land that was located to the east of [[Doriath|Artanor]] where a collection of ''\"evil tribes of renegade men\"'' made sacrifices to Gods whose idols were hidden upon a wooded mountain.<ref>{{HM|LT2}}, pp. 35, 62, 374</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Lay of the Children of Húrin]]'', [[Túrin]] and [[Gwindor|Flinding]] came upon Nan Dumgorthin in the dim twilight after the accidental murder of [[Beleg]]. It is described as dark and unholy; a grey valley where shrines are hidden in secret places for the worship of [[Nameless things|nameless gods]] older than both [[Morgoth]] and the [[Valar]]. The inhabitants here were said to be ''\"ghostly dwellers\"'' whose laughter was ''\"harsh and hallow\"'' like a mockery of demons with a lingering echo. They did not harm Túrin and Flinding nor hinder their course, yet their mere presence was enough to cause them both to walk ''\"with creeping flesh and quaking limb\"''.<ref>{{LB|1d}}, lines 1472-1490</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Valar]]"}}}
