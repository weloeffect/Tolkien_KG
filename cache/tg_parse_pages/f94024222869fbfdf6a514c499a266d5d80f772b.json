He was portrayed by Kelly Kilgour.\n\n==History==\nIn {{TA|2941}}, when [[Thorin and Company]] were hiding in Lake-town after their fight with two other guards whom were knocked unconscious before they could arrest the [[Dwarves]], Soury, [[Braga]], and a few others arrived to find out what was going on. After the incident, Soury was among the other guards who arrested the Company for their attempt to steal weapons, but then [[Thorin|Thorin Oakenshield]] revealed himself to the crowd and persuaded the [[Master of Lake-town]] to welcome them and help them reclaim the [[Lonely Mountain]].\n\nLater Soury was one of the guards who tried to arrest [[Bard]] for his charges against the Master before the Bargeman was knocked unconscious by the Master himself. After Bard's arrest, he got himself drunk along with Braga and the other guards while Bard tried to warn them about [[Smaug]]'s arrival.<ref>''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]''</ref> Soury was among the survivors who escaped Lake-town's destruction by Smaug, and pledged his loyalty to Bard after he killed the [[Dragons|Dragon]] with the last [[black arrow]]. Seeking refuge in the ruined city of [[Dale]], Soury participated in the [[Battle of Five Armies]] and was killed while defending the city.<ref>''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]''</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Men from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Hobbit (film series) characters]]"}}}
