Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]], it is possible that the parentheses which Tolkien put the poem in meant that he was uncertain of including it in his list.<ref name=\"list\"/>\n\nIn September [[2024]], the poem was published for the first time as entry 35 in ''[[The Collected Poems of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'' along with the earliest version.<ref name=collectedpoems/> In their commentary to the first version, Hammond and Scull interpreted the name of the earlier version, ''Thoughts on Parade'', as referring to \"the poet's thoughts…parading through his consciousness…while he is on parade…among an assembly of troops\".<ref name=collectedpoems/> In their commentary to the revised poem, Hammond and Scull suggested that, while the \"[[Wikipedia:Black Swallow|black swallow]]\" probably shouldn't be taken \"too literally\", such a bird did exist, though not in [[England]].<ref name=collectedpoems/> In a note on their \"Addenda and Corrigenda to ''The Collected Poems of J.R.R. Tolkien''\", Hammond and Scull note that, while \"[[Christopher Tolkien]] read the title on the second manuscript with a comma\", they \"felt that the mark…was too indistinct to be certainly a mark of punctuation\".<ref name=\"comma\"/> However, since Tolkien never wrote \"out the revised title\" anywhere else, they did not have anything to compare to the writing on the second manuscript.<ref name=\"comma\"/>\n\n== Inspiration ==\nAccording to Hammond and Scull, Tolkien may have used a swallow in the poem because it was \"a familiar, and seemingly fearless, migratory bird\" and that \"flocks of swallows historically tended to arrive in England in March or April\" before leaving \"in September or October\" for southern Africa; this was \"a long journey twice each year\". Tolkien would later use the same imagery of \"swallows singing in the eaves\" in ''[[Dark Are the Clouds about the North]]''.<ref>{{CP|38}}, p. 240</ref> Tolkien may have been using this as an allusion to how, while he \"was only some sixty miles away from [[Edith Bratt]] in Warwick,…it was a 'long road' while he was bound by military law\". Hammond and Scull also note that \"the language and nature of Tolkien's poem\" seems to \"recall those of\" [[Wikipedia:Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]]'s ''[[Wikipedia:The Princess (Tennyson poem)|The Princess]]'', a poem that inspired [[Wikipedia:Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s \"[[Wikipedia:List of poems by Samuel Taylor Coleridge#Something Childish, but very Natural. Written in Germany.|Something Childish, but Very Natural]]\", which has \"lines with a similar sentiment\".<ref name=collectedpoems/>\n\n{{References}}\n\n{{Poems}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Swallow, and the Traveller on the Plains, The}}\n\n[[Category:Poems by J.R.R.
