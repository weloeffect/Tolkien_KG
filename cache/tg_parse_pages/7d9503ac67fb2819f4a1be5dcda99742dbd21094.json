J. R. R. Tolkien wrote many stories, studied languages—even inventing one of his own and fought bravely in World War I. He wrote ''The Hobbit'', a children's book about a courageous creature with pointed ears and furry feet, which was an instant success. His next book, ''The Lord of the Rings'', made Tolkien, an ordinary man with an extraordinary imagination, one of the world's most beloved authors. Includes a time line and bibliography.}}\n\n==External links==\n\n*[http://sacnoths.blogspot.com/2011/06/return-of-emu.html Thoughts on the book] by [[John D.
