In the beginning, Elendil was [[High King of the Dúnedain|High King]] of both realms, but the two were divided after the deaths of his sons. Over 3,000 years later [[Aragorn]] was crowned as '''''Elessar''''' and reunited the kingdoms, ruling as [[High King of the Dúnedain|High King]] of the newly-founded Reunited Kingdom.\n\n==Geography==\nDuring Aragorn's reign, the Reunited Kingdom was comprised of the old realms of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]], excluding only [[Rohan]] (the [[Oath of Eorl|grant]] of which he renewed); and the [[Shire]], the [[Drúadan Forest]], and the [[Treegarth of Orthanc]] (which became protectorates).<ref name=\"Appendix A\"/>\n\nThe Reunited Kingdom included all the lands of [[Arnor]]; all of [[Eriador]], except the [[Lindon|regions]] beyond the [[Lune]], and the lands east of [[Greyflood]] and [[Loudwater]], in which lay [[Rivendell]] and [[Eregion]].<ref name=\"Eriador\">{{App|Eriador}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Gondor]], the realm extended:<ref name=\"AppGondor\">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>\n\n* North to the [[Field of Celebrant]] and the southern eaves of [[Mirkwood]]<ref name=\"AppGondor\"/>\n* West to the [[Greyflood]]<ref name=\"AppGondor\"/>\n* East to the inland [[Sea of Rhûn]]<ref name=\"AppGondor\"/>\n* South to the [[River Harnen]], and also along the coast to the peninsula and haven of [[Umbar]]<ref name=\"AppGondor\"/>\n\n==Politics==\nThe [[Númenórean]] [[High King (Dúnedain)|High King]] governed the realm with the frame of ancient law, of which he was administrator (and interpreter) but not the maker.<ref name=\"politics\">{{L|244}}</ref> \n\nIn all debatable matters of importance domestic, or external, however, even [[Denethor II|Denethor]] had a [[Council of Gondor|Council]], and at least listened to what the Lords of the Fiefs and the Captains of the Forces had to say.<ref name=\"politics\"/> [[Aragorn]] re-established the [[Council of Gondor|Great Council of Gondor]], and in that [[Faramir]], who remained by inheritance the [[Steward]] (or representative of the King during his absence abroad, or sickness, or between his death and the accession of his heir) was his chief counsellor.<ref name=\"politics\"/>\n\nAfter his accession, [[Aragorn]] established a council in [[Arnor]], because in {{FoA|13}}, he chose three [[Counsellor of the North-kingdom|Counsellors of the North-kingdom]] from the people of the [[Shire]] and [[Buckland]].<ref name=\"AppBLater\">{{App|B5}}</ref> These Counsellors were those appointed to the positions of the [[Thain]] and [[Mayor of the Shire]], and the [[Master of Buckland]].<ref name=\"AppBLater\"/>\n\n==History==\n===Background===\n{{main|Realms in Exile}}\nAt the end of the [[Second Age]], [[Elendil]] and his sons established two great kingdoms in [[Middle-earth]]: [[Arnor]] in the north and [[Gondor]] in the south. These [[Kingdoms of the Dúnedain]] were united under a single [[High King of the Dúnedain|High King]], [[Elendil]] himself, who ruled the [[Arnor|North-kingdom]] while his sons reigned jointly over the South-kingdom of [[Gondor]].<ref name=rings>{{s|Rings}}</ref>\n\nIn the first years of the [[Third Age]], this union failed. After the loss of [[Isildur]] at the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]], his nephew [[Meneldil]] took up the [[Kings of Gondor|kingship of Gondor]], and that country remained independent from the [[North-kingdom]] through most of the [[Third Age]].<ref name=rings/>  \n\nIn the north, the realm of Arnor fell into troubled times. It broke into three separate kingdoms, and in time these too were lost, so that the Dúnedain of the North-kingdom of Elendil were reduced to a wandering people led by a [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain|Chieftain]]. Nonetheless, they were able to maintain Isildur's line in unbroken descent.<ref name=rings/>\n\nThere was only one attempt to reunite the kingdoms while they were both in existence. This attempt occurred in {{TA|1944}} when [[Arvedui]], [[King of Arthedain]], claimed the [[High King (Dúnedain)|High Kingship]] of the [[Two Kingdoms]].<ref name=\"AppGondor\"/> His claim was rejected by Steward [[Pelendur]] and the [[Council of Gondor]], who elected to maintain their independence.<ref name=\"AppGondor\"/>\n\nSoon enough, the line of [[King of Gondor|Kings]] failed in [[Gondor]] altogether; [[Eärnur]] was lost without heirs. Its rule was taken up by the [[Stewards]] of the [[House of Húrin]].<ref name=rings/>\n\n===Reunification===\n====Reign of Elessar====\nMore than a thousand years later, after the [[War of the Ring]], Arvedui's direct descendant, [[Aragorn]], came forward to make the same claim. This time, the people of Gondor accepted a [[High King of the Dúnedain|High King]], and the Two Kingdoms were restored and reunited at last. \n\n[[Aragorn]] restored [[Gondor]] and repeopled it, but retained [[Minas Tirith]] as the chief city.<ref name=\"Elendil\"/> He rebuilt [[Annúminas]] and when he went north, would rule from there.<ref name=\"Eriador\"/> He also had the ruins of [[Fornost Erain]] rebuilt and made it a great city where [[Men]] dwelt once again.<ref name=\"Bound\">{{RK|VI7}}</ref> [[The Shire]] was an exception to this, and though it lay within the Reunited Kingdom, Aragorn made a law that Men should not enter it, a law that he observed himself.<ref name=\"Eriador\"/>\n\nDuring his reign, he, alongside [[King of Rohan|King]] [[Éomer]], led military campaigns beyond the [[Sea of Rhûn]] and on the far deserts of the [[South]].<ref name=\"Appendix A\">{{App|Mark}}</ref> The threat of the [[Corsairs of Umbar|Corsairs]] was finally completely subdued during his reign.<ref name=\"AppGondor\"/> He also made peace with the [[Haradrim]] after his coronation.<ref name=\"RK-StewardKing\">{{RK|VI5}}</ref>\n\n====Later History====\nAfter Aragorn's death in {{FoA|120}},<ref name=\"Tale\">{{App|Tale}}</ref> his son [[Eldarion]] took up the High Kingship.<ref name=\"Tale\"/> It is said that Eldarion's reign lasted for about 100 years after the death of Aragorn.<ref name=\"L338\">{{L|338}}</ref>\nOf [[Eldarion]], it was foretold that he should rule a great realm, and that it should endure for a hundred generations of [[Men]] after him, that is until a new age brought in again new things; and from him should come the kings of many realms in long days after.
