It describes events, later replaced by the [[Battle of the Powers]], leading to the [[Chaining of Melkor]].\n\n== Synopsis ==\n[[Eriol]] talked with [[Vairë (wife of Lindo)|Vairë]] about [[Tinfang|Timpinen]]. The man learnt that Timpinen's music caused longing that only the drink ''[[limpë]]'' could heal but only queen [[Meril-i-Turinqi|Meril]] could give it. [[Littleheart]] led Eriol to Meril but she refused to give him ''limpë'' immediately as first he had to learn more. She started a tale about times when [[Melko]] was imprisoned.\n\n[[Yavanna|Palúrien]] went to the dark lands and created mosses, ferns, and strange creatures and later, with the help of [[Oromë]], pine woods. This made Melko angry, for he treated the world as his domain, therefore he brought upon the earth fire and earthquakes. This in turn incited the Valar to assault him.\n\nAfter a council, in which even [[Ulmo]] took part, [[Aulë]] made ''[[tilkal]]'' - from copper, silver, tin, plumb, iron, and gold - a new seventh metal, and from this material he made chains, called [[Angainor|Angaino]], with two manacles Vorotemnar and four fetters Ilterendi. The Valar decided to arrest Melko through deception rather than in open war, so they asked him to move to [[Valinor]] as the greatest Valar. They came to Melko in [[Utumno|Utumna]], [[Tulkas]] bringing Angaino, and with Aulë chained Melko. Aulë put Vorotemnar on the Melko's hands and two Ilterendi on each of his ankles.\n\nAfterwards, Tulkas and Ulmo blocked Utumna forever. Melko was sentenced for three centuries in the dungeons of [[Mandos]] and four centuries in service for Tulkas. During Melko's imprisonment, more living beings - e.g. birds, little animals and fish - appeared.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chaining of Melko}}"}}}
