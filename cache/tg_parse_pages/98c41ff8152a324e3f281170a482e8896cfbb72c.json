According to [[Andreas Möhn]], the Durin's Day of {{TA|2941}} occurred on [[22 October]] of the [[Shire Calendar]]. This is based in the assumption that the orbital period of the moon, as described in ''The Lord of the Rings'', was about 20 minutes shorter/faster than today.<ref>{{webcite|author=Andreas Möhn|articleurl=http://pages.citebite.com/b3g6a9v1lflq|articlename=The Moon and Durin's Day|dated=|website=lalaithmesp.blogspot.com|accessed=15-02-2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] made a rough estimation based purely on the traveling times and distances, without any astronomical calculations.
