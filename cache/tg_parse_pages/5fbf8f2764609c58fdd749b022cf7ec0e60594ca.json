People in Bree didn't like Harley Bramble and they didn't treat him well. When Harley met a [[Southerners|Southerner]], the southerner used this to stir him up against the other [[Bree-landers]]. If Harley would help the Southerners, he would be running things in Bree at the end. However, when the two were confronted by [[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]], [[Andriel]] and [[Farin (video game character)|Farin]], Harley did choose to stay on the good side.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], ''Prologue''</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Southerners]]\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Men from adaptations]]  \n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: War in the North characters]]"}}}
