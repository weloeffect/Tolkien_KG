It does not connect the [[Brown Lands]] to the [[Field of Celebrant]] directly, but rather to the ''Rushgore'' marsh that lies in between them. The Rohirrim have constructed and manned a fortified camp of ''Etheburg'' on the eastern bank of Anduin in the Brown Lands to watch over the North Undeep.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Fords]]\n[[Category:Rhovanion]]"}}}
