Together with his friends in the Kolbítar Club, Tolkien studied the works of Wagner during the late 1920s.<ref>[[Andrew Lazo]], \"Gathered Round Northern Fires: The Imaginative Impact of the Kolbítar\", in ''Chance 2004''</ref> \n\nAnother member of the club, [[C.S. Lewis]], was an avid fan of Wagner, and collected recordings of Wagner, owned illustrations by [[wikipedia: Arthur Rackham|Arthur Rackham]] (a British illustrator, often depicting scenes from the works of Wagner, to whom Tolkien also warmed), dreamt about turning the ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' into prose, and took Tolkien to London to see a staging of the ''Ring''.<ref>{{HM|Inklings}}, p. 56 (note 1)</ref><ref>[[Andrew Lazo]], \"Gathered Round Northern Fires: The Imaginative Impact of the Kolbítar\", p.197</ref><ref>Christine Chism, \"Middle-Earth, the Middle Ages, and the Aryan Nation: Myth and History in World War II\", in ''Chance 2003'', p.75f</ref> During the 1930s, Lewis and Tolkien apparently began working on a translation of the second, and most popular, of the four ''Ring'' instalments, ''[[Die Walküre]]''.<ref>Stefan Arvidsson,  ''[[Draksjukan|Draksjukan. Mytiska fantasier hos Tolkien, Wagner och de Vries]]'', p.148</ref><ref>Alex Ross, \"[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/12/22/031222crat_atlarge?currentPage=1#ixzz0uWWEbKTn The Ring and the Rings: Wagner vs. Tolkien]\", in ''The New Yorker'', December 22, 2003</ref>\n\nIn the scholarly study of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], Wagner is mostly mentioned in the context of the apparent similarities between ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', Wagner's tetralogy of musical dramas based on the Norse sagas and the ''Nibelungenlied'', and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Hobbit]] and [[The Children of Húrin|The Children of Hurin]].'' By and large, these similarities can be chalked up to the shared mythological sources, namely the ''[[Völuspá]]'' and ''[[wikipedia: Völsunga Saga|Völsunga Saga]]'' - although some scholars argue for a few more direct inspiration: In ''[[The History of The Hobbit]],'' [[John D. Rateliff]] is inclined to credit Wagner with inspiring the naming of [[Mîm]] which, although derived from ''Mimir'' in the sagas, only appears as the name of an untrustworthy Dwarf (substituting Regin) in Wagner's ''Siegfried''.<ref>{{HH|Adventure}}, (i) ''The Dwarves'', Endnote 8, p. 86</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*''[[Tolkien and Wagner|Tolkien and Wagner: The Ring and Der Ring]]''\n*''[[Wagner and Tolkien|Wagner and Tolkien: Mythmakers]]''\n\n==External links==\n*{{WP|Richard Wagner}}\n{{References}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Wagner, Richard}}\n[[Category:Composers]]\n[[Category:German people]]\n[[Category:People by name]]"}}}
