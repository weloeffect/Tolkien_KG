He was lord of the [[Gondolindrim|Elves of Nevrast]], and later of the Hidden City of [[Gondolin]].\n\nHe was often called \"''the Wise''\" and is described as \"tallest of all the [[Children of the World]], save [[Thingol]]\"; with a white and gold [[Glamdring|sword]] in an ivory sheath.<ref name=\"Tuor\">{{UT|Tuor}}, \"Notes\", p. 56, note 31</ref> He sat in a high throne, holding his staff of doom.<ref name=\"Maeglin\">{{S|16}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Marya Filatova - Turukano and Elenwe.jpg|left|150px|thumb|''Turukáno and Elenwe'' by [[Marya Filatova]]]]\n===Life in Aman===\nTurgon was born in the [[Year of the Trees 1300]], the same year as his cousin [[Finrod]].<ref>{{AA|85|note}}, p. 106</ref> At some point, he married [[Elenwë]] of the [[Vanyar]], and they had a child: [[Idril]]. \n\nAfter the [[Darkening of Valinor]], [[Fëanor]] gave his famous speech in [[Tirion]] and proclaimed his [[Oath of Fëanor|Oath]]. Turgon and his father [[Fingolfin]] spoke against Fëanor, and the Fëanorians almost unsheathed their swords, but [[Finarfin]] intervened and invited the Noldor to ponder the matter. Turgon and his friend Finrod were together against the departure of the Noldor from [[Aman]], but the Noldorin assembly chose [[Exile of the Noldor|Exile]]. So Turgon set out on the journey, and although he was originally against it, he did not come back after the [[Doom of Mandos]] because \"Fingon and Turgon were bold and fiery of heart, and loath to abandon any task to which they had put their hands until the bitter end, if bitter it must be\". After Fëanor and his [[Sons of Fëanor|sons]] departed using the only ships, abandoning the remaining Noldor, Turgon went with his people across the dangerous [[Helcaraxë]] alongside his father Fingolfin.<ref>{{S|9}}</ref> During the crossing, Turgon's wife Elenwë, and their daughter Idril fell into the bitter waters. Turgon risked his life to save them, but he only could save Idril, and Elenwë was lost. Turgon was always hostile to the [[House of Fëanor]] thereafter.<ref>{{PM|XI4}}, pp. 345-346</ref>\n\n===Building of Gondolin===\nOnce they arrived in [[Middle-earth]], Turgon and his followers settled at [[Vinyamar]] in [[Nevrast]]. In {{FA|50}}, he and Finrod journeyed together along [[Sirion]], and while they slept near the [[Aelin-uial]], [[Ulmo]] sent both of them a dream to look for a hidden place where they could be safe from the power of [[Morgoth]]. Then, in the following year, Ulmo appeared directly to Turgon and guided him to the vale of [[Tumladen]] in the [[Encircling Mountains]]. Initially, Turgon left Tumladen and returned to Vinyamar, keeping his discovery a secret for many years and planning the construction of a city.<ref>{{S|13}}</ref> \n[[File:Mysilvergreen - Turgon and Idril.jpg|thumb|''Turgon and Idril'' by [[:Category:Images by Mysilvergreen|Mysilvergreen]]]]\nAfter the [[Dagor Aglareb]], Turgon began to once again feel the restlessness set in his heart by Ulmo, and his thought turned to Tumladen. He secretly moved many of the most skilled Noldor to the valley, and had them build [[Gondolin]]. When it was completed in {{FA|116}},<ref>{{GA|111}}</ref> he abandoned Vinyamar with all his people and led them to Tumladen in secret, hidden by the power of Ulmo. Before leaving, however, he left in Vinyamar a sword, mail and helm for one who would come in the hour of direst need of the Noldor and deliver hope, following Ulmo's prophecy. In his Hidden City, Turgon was King of the [[Gondolindrim]], and all kept working on embellishing Gondolin. He even personally created the two trees [[Glingal and Belthil]] in the image of the [[Two Trees]].<ref>{{S|15}}</ref>\n\nIn {{FA|400}},<ref>{{GA|120}}</ref> after the unfortunate events concerning his sister [[Aredhel]], Turgon welcomed his nephew [[Maeglin]], who became a close counsellor.<ref name=\"Maeglin\" />\n\n===Doom of the Noldor===\nIn {{FA|458}} Turgon took in [[Húrin]] and [[Huor]], who were saved by the [[Eagles]]. They forged a strong friendship, but after a year he allowed them to leave the city, although it was against his law.<ref>{{S|18}}</ref> Turgon and the two brothers met again in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]: in the middle of the battle, they rejoiced in their meeting. When Fingon was killed and the battle seemed lost, Huor urged Turgon to leave, prophesying that from both of them a new [[Eärendil|star]] would rise. Thanks to the men of the [[House of Hador]] in the [[Fen of Serech]], the Gondolindrim escaped, but Huor was killed and Húrin captured. Although the battle was still lost, Turgon's unexpected intervention prevented the rout from completely destroying the armies of the Noldor and their allies.<ref name=\"Nirnaeth\">{{S|20}}</ref>\n\nWith the death of his brother Fingon, Turgon became the new [[High King of the Noldor]], and he was the most feared of the enemies of [[Morgoth]], as he remained hidden.<ref>{{UT|1}}, p. 18</ref> In those times, [[Círdan]] settled in the [[Mouths of Sirion]], and with his help, Turgon sent seven boats to the [[Aman|West]] to ask help to the Valar, but all of them were wrecked.<ref name=\"Nirnaeth\" />\n[[File:Catherine Karina Chmiel - Turgon, Idril, and Maeglin together.jpg|thumb|''Turgon, Idril, and Maeglin together'' by [[Catherine Karina Chmiel]]]]\nIn {{FA|495}},<ref>{{GA|299}}</ref> [[Voronwë]], the only survivor of the shipwrecks, brought into the Hidden City a man: [[Tuor]], son of Huor. The King received him in the [[Tower of the King]], and when Tuor spoke, his cloak fell, revealing the arms Turgon had left in Vinyamar following Ulmo's orders nearly 400 years earlier.<ref name=\"Tuor\" /> Tuor gave him [[Ulmo's warning]]: the [[Doom of the Noldor]] was approaching, so the [[Gondolindrim]] had to leave their fair city and go down Sirion to the sea. But the King had become proud and loved his kingdom, so he rejected the counsel of the Vala. However, he ordered the blocking up of the [[Seven Gates]], so that no one could enter the city, and the only news that came in was that brought by [[Thorondor]].<ref name=\"Fall\">{{S|23}}</ref>\n\nSome years later, Húrin was released by Morgoth, and he approached the [[Echoriad]] with the hope of returning to Gondolin. Thorondor informed Turgon, but he distrusted Húrin and did not help him. Turgon later regretted it, but it was too late; through Húrin's wanderings, the location of the Hidden City became known to Morgoth.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, pp. 271-272</ref>\n\nSeven years after his coming, Tuor married Idril. Turgon blessed their union, as he held Tuor in great esteem and he had not forgotten the words of Huor in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad.<ref name=\"Fall\">{{S|23}}</ref>\n\nMorgoth attacked the city in {{FA|510}}.<ref>{{WJ|Years}}, p. 351</ref> The tale of this battle was told in [[Turgon#Other versions of the legendarium|''The Fall of Gondolin'']], including Turgon's defence of the Tower of the King together with the people of his stronghold: \"and mighty was its fall and the fall of Turgon in its ruin\".<ref name=\"Fall\">{{S|23}}</ref>\n\nA group of [[Exiles of Gondolin|Exiles]] survived the [[Fall of Gondolin]] and reached the [[Mouths of Sirion]]. There [[Gil-galad|Ereinion Gil-galad]] was named the next High King of the Noldor.

He is the son of Finwë Nólemë, lord of the [[Noldoli]] (precursor of both [[Finwë]] and [[Fingolfin]]). Before Turgon (or ''Turondo'' in [[Qenya]]) was born, [[Amnon]] prophesied the fall of Gondolin and the fade of Turgon.<ref>{{LT1|VII}}, pp. 167, 172</ref> Turgon was born soon after the [[Exile of the Noldor|Flight of the Noldoli]] in [[Lake Mithrim]] or near [[Sirion]]. Later he participated in the [[Battle of Unnumbered Tears]], and there his father was isolated and slain by the enemy, and the Orcs cut out Nólemë's heart. But Turgon rescued the body, and the [[scarlet heart]] became his emblem. With terrible wrath, he ran out of the battle, and went to save the women and children of the camps. Then he fled south along Sirion, and aided by its magic waters, he escaped into a secret place away from [[Melko]]. There the Noldoli built the secret city of Gondolin and Turgon became their king.<ref>{{LT1|X}}, pp. 238-242</ref>\n\nMany years later, when [[Tuor#Other versions of the legendarium|Tuor]] came to the city, he found Turgon in the [[Square of the Palace]]. \"Then Turgon king of Gondolin robed in white with a belt of gold, and a coronet of garnets upon his head, stood before his doors and spake from the head of the white stairs that led thereto.\" Tuor was well received, as his coming was prophesied, but [[Ulmo's warning]] was not attended by the king, who answered that he had already sent boats to the West which had never come back. However, Turgon knew that Tuor had the favour of the Valar, and invited him to dwell in Gondolin, even in the royal halls.<ref name=\"Gondolin\">{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|160–2}}\n\nMany years later, Turgon allowed the wedding of Tuor and his daughter Idril. All the [[Gondothlim]] and the king were overjoyed when [[Eärendel]] was born, except [[Meglin]], the king's nephew and close counsellor.<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|164–5}} One year later, news came about spies of [[Morgoth|Melko]] near [[Tumladin]], and the king remembered the words of Tuor, so he tripled the watch and ordered preparations for war.<ref name=\"Gondolin\">{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|167}} However, more years passed and his fear softened, and the watch was reduced again, as the Gondothlim became confident after Melko withdrew the spies.<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|170}}\n[[File:Natalie Chen - Turgon King of Gondolin.jpg|thumb|''Turgon King of Gondolin'' by [[:Category:Images by Natalie Chen|Natalie Chen]]]]\nDuring the [[Tarnin Austa]], news came about the armies of Melko approaching the city, so Turgon called a council and all the [[twelve houses of the Gondothlim]] came to his palace. Among them were his personal guard, the [[House of the King]], who wore his emblems: the [[sun]], the [[moon]] and the [[scarlet heart]].<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|172}} In the council, all the lords of Gondolin supported Tuor, who wanted to leave the city to save all the people; but the king was convinced by Meglin and [[Salgant]] alone, because they appealed to the wealth and strength of the city.<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|175–6}}\n\nThus, the [[Fall of Gondolin]] began. Turgon watched most of the battle from [[Tower of the King|his tower]],<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|180}} while his folk was held in reserve in the Square of the Palace, waiting in order to defend him.<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|183}} Throughout the siege, the king sent the different reserved hosts to help where necessary, until the remnants of all the surviving houses finally gathered in the Square. After [[Ecthelion of the Fountain]] there killed [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]], the king came down in splendour and helped his house to cleanse the square. But the steam of the fountains killed some men, so the king was saved and taken under [[Glingol]] and [[Bansil]]. Then said the king: \"''Great is the fall of Gondolin!''\", the words of the prophet [[Amnon]]. Seeing he had brought ruin upon his city, he proclaimed he would not fight against [[Doom of the Noldor|Doom]], so he ordered the survivors to follow Tuor and threw down his [[Crown of the Hidden Kingdom|\ncrown]] at the roots of Glingol. [[Galdor (elf of Gondolin)|Galdor]] picked it up, but Turgon rejected it and climbed to the pinnacle of his tower.<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|184–5}}\n\n{{blockquote|There he shouted in a voice like a horn blown among the mountains, and all that were gathered beneath the Trees and the foemen in the mists of the square heard him: \"Great is the victory of the Noldoli!\" And 'tis said that it was then middle night, and that the Orcs yelled in derision.}}\n\nNow, Tuor wanted to escape from the city to save the women and children, but he could not leave the king, so messengers were sent to convince Turgon to flee. But Turgon refused thrice, saying he would not leave his city and would burn with it. His royal house remained at his side, protecting the tower.<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|185}} Later, Tuor and Idril could see from the [[Gar Ainion]] how the Square of the King was taken by enemies. Dragons crushed the base of the tower and this fell, covered in flames. \"Great was the clangour of that terrible fall, and therein passed Turgon King of the Gondothlim\". Idril wept for her father, saying \"''Sad is the blindness of the wise''\"; and Tuor answered \"''Sad too is the stubbornness of those we love — yet 'twas a valiant fault''\".<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|187}}\n\n{{references|notes}}\n\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n|race=noldor\n|house=[[House of Fingolfin]]<small><br/>Cadet branch of [[House of Finwë]]</small>\n|born={{YT|1300}}\n|died={{FA|510}}\n}}\n{{seq\n|pvac=None\n|prev=Title established\n|list=King of [[Gondolin]]\n|dates={{FA|116}} - {{FA|510|n}}\n|nvac=None\n|next=[[Fall of Gondolin|Kingdom destroyed]]\n}}\n{{seq\n|prev=[[Fingon]]\n|list=3rd [[High King of the Noldor]]\n|dates={{FA|472}} – {{FA|510|n}}\n|next=[[Gil-galad]]\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n\n{{HousesofGondolin}}\n[[Category:Calaquendi]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Gnomish names]]\n[[Category:Gondolindrim]]\n[[Category:House of Fingolfin]]\n[[Category:Noldor]]\n[[Category:Rulers in Beleriand]]\n[[Category:Rulers in the Great Lands]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n[[de:Turgon (Sohn von Fingolfin)]]\n[[fi:Turgon (haltia)]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/elfes/noldor/turukano]]"}}}
