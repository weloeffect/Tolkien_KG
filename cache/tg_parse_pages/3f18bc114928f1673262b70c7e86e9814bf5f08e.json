'''''[[Periannath]]''''') was a name for [[Hobbits]] used by [[Men]]; it was originally given to them by the tall [[Dúnedain]] who had stood two [[ranga]]r tall, making the average Hobbit about half their height. The term first applied to the [[Harfoots]] who became known in [[Arnor]] around {{TA|1050}} and later to the [[Fallohides]] and the [[Stoors]].<ref name=linear>{{UT|Linear}}</ref>\n\nThe name reached the [[Gondorians]], which they learned from their [[Dúnedain of Arnor|northern cousins]] although they never had seen a halfling in person until the [[War of the Ring]].<ref name=linear/>\n\nThe word halfling appeared in the final line of the [[Seek for the Sword that was broken|rhyme]] from [[Faramir]] and [[Boromir]]'s dreams, \"''And the Halfling forth shall stand.''\" Boromir claimed to have understood little of the rhyme, but recognized [[Frodo Baggins]] as the Halfling when he stood up with [[the One Ring]].<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref> However, by that time the Gondorians were shorter than their ancestors since the line of the Kings ended, and the halflings were more than half of their height.<ref name=linear/>\n\n\nIt became known that a halfling bore the Ring, and [[Saruman]] gave orders to the [[Uruk-hai]] to capture any halflings alive and bring them back without plundering them. This led to the capture of [[Pippin]] and [[Merry]], who were halflings, although neither of them was the [[Ring-bearer]].<ref>{{TT|Uruk}}</ref> [[Peregrin Took]] became the first halfling who visited [[Minas Tirith]],<ref name=linear/> whom the Gondorians recognised as a \"[[Ernil i Pheriannath|Prince of the Halflings]]\".<ref>{{RK|V1}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Halfling\" is a translation from the [[Westron]] ''[[banakil]]'' which means \"half-man\".
