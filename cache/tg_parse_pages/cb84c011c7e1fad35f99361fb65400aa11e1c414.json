He was born in [[Aman]], but joined the [[Exile of the Noldor]] and returned to [[Middle-earth]]. In [[Beleriand]], Angrod and his younger brother [[Aegnor]] ruled over [[Dorthonion]] as vassals of their elder brother [[Finrod]]. He was also the father of [[Orodreth]]. \n\nAngrod is most notable for his role as messenger between the Noldor and [[Thingol]]. He was the first Noldo to enter [[Doriath]] where he reported on the strength and array of the Noldor, and offered a glossed account of their return. When Angrod brought Thingol's decree on where the Noldor were permitted to settle to a [[Council in Mithrim|Noldor council]], it was not well received and [[Caranthir]] angrily deriding the sons of Finarfin acting as representatives of the Noldor, and even questioned their loyalty, causing Angrod to depart in wrath. Later, after Thingol learned rumour of the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë]], Angrod, still bitter from Caranthir's words, confirmed the story and further shared the full truth of the misdeeds of the [[House of Fëanor]]; in response, Thingol banned the speaking of [[Quenya]].\n\nHe, along with Aegnor, was slain in the [[Dagor Bragollach]] (\"Battle of Sudden Flame\").\n\n== History ==\n===Life in Valinor===\nAngrod was born in Aman as the second son of Finarfin and Eärwen. Through his father, he was descended of [[Finwë]], [[King of the Noldor]], and [[Indis]] of the [[Vanyar]]; through his mother he was descended of [[Olwë]], King of the [[Falmari|Teleri of Aman]] and younger brother of [[Elwë]] (Thingol). Angrod was thus ¼ Noldo, ¼ Vanya, and ½ Teler. His elder brother was Finrod, and his younger siblings were Aegnor and [[Galadriel]].\n\nAlong with Finrod and Aegnor, Angrod was very close in friendship with the sons of [[Fingolfin]], as though they were all brothers.<ref name=princes>{{S|Princes}}</ref> He married [[Eldalótë]] and fathered [[Orodreth]].<ref name=descendants /><ref group=\"note\">Orodreth being Angrod's son was a late development: in earlier legendarium material, including the published ''[[Silmarillion]]'', Orodreth is Angrod's elder brother</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Darkening of Valinor]], Angrod was present during [[Speech of Fëanor|Fëanor's speech]] where Fëanor claimed kingship and urged the Noldor to return to Middle-earth to win freedom and claim great realms. In this matter, Angrod stood with [[Fingon]] and Galadriel in a position of wishing to return to Middle-earth, but not accepting Fëanor as their leader. Finarfin in contrast urged caution to not act rashly and undertake deeds which could not be undone; at this Angrod held his peace and did not speak against his father.<ref name=flight>{{S|9}}</ref>\n\nIn the Exile of the Noldor, [[House of Finarfin|Finarfin's host]] marched in the rear, and were thus not present at the Kinslaying at Alqualondë. After a further great while, the hosts reached the borders of the empty wastes of [[Araman]] and heard the [[Doom of Mandos]]. At this, Finarfin and a great many of his people turned back, but his sons went forward as they would not forsake the sons of Fingolfin. After Fëanor stole the ships, the people of Fingolfin and Finarfin were stranded in Araman, and wondered long in misery until eventually venturing the cross the terror of the [[Helcaraxë]]. In this crossing, many were lost, and it was with a lessened host that they eventually arrived in Middle-earth.<ref name=flight />\n\n===Life in Beleriand===\nIn {{FA|2}} the host of Fingolfin made camp on the north-shore of [[Lake Mithrim]] where there dwelt the [[House of Fëanor]]. Though Fëanor himself had since been slain, Fingolfin held [[sons of Fëanor|his sons]] to be accomplices, and there was peril of war between the Noldor until Fingon assuaged the hatred by his rescue of [[Maedhros]].<ref name=GA>{{WJ|One}}</ref>{{rp|§§58-61}}\n\nIn {{FA|6}}, due to their kinship, Thingol permitted those of Finarfin's house to pass through the [[Girdle of Melian]] and come to [[Menegroth]]. First of these was Angrod, who came as a messenger of Finrod. Angrod spoke at length with Thingol, and told him of the deeds of the Noldor, of their strength, and the ordering of their forces. However, deeming that the griefs had been forgiven, he did not speak of the misdeeds of Fëanor except for his valiant death. Thingol, in turn, gave Angrod a message to return to the Noldor: he gave them leave to dwell in [[Hithlum]], Dorthonion, and [[East Beleriand]], but he also cautioned that the Noldor properly conduct themselves, as he was the Lord of Beleriand and all shall hear his word. Lastly, he forbid any to enter [[Doriath]] except those he called as guests, or if he were sought in great need.<ref name=GA />{{rp|§§63-64}}\n\nIn {{FA|7}} the Noldor held council in Mithrim. At this council Angrod came bearing the words of Thingol. The Noldor thought this to be a cold welcome, with the sons of Fëanor especially wroth at them. Caranthir, the harshest of the brethren, and who loved not the sons of Finarfin, angrily remarked on Angrod sharing so much information with Thingol, or even being a spokesmen of the Noldor at all; further he insinuated that they were forgetting that their father was a Noldo in favour of their mother's kin. At these words Angrod grew extremely wroth, and departed from the council.<ref name=GA />{{rp|§§66-68}}\n\n[[File:Marya_Filatova_-_Lords_of_Dorthonion.jpg|right|thumb|''Lords of Dorthonion'' by [[Marya Filatova]]]]\nFollowing this, the Noldor partially encircled [[Angband]] on the west, south, and east. In the south, together with Aegnor, Angrod held Dorthonion as a vassal of Finrod. Their people were few as the land was barren and the great highlands behind were deemed a barrier that Morgoth would not lightly seek to cross.<ref name=Beleriand>{{S|14}}</ref> Among the people of Angrod were [[Gelmir (messenger of Círdan)|Gelmir]] and [[Arminas]].<ref>{{S|21}}</ref>\n\nIn {{FA|60}}, Morgoth issued a [[Dagor Aglareb|major attack]], with his main host set against Dorthonion. During this assault, Fingolfin and Maedhros led their own forces and hit Morgoth's host from either side, and it was destroyed utterly.<ref>{{LR|QS}}</ref>{{rp|102}} The Noldor then tightened their leaguer, establishing the [[Siege of Angband]].\n\nIn {{FA|67}}, Thingol was informed by [[Círdan]] of the whispered tales of the deeds of the Noldor before they came to Beleriand. It chanced that the sons of Finarfin were guests of Thingol at this time, having come to see Galadriel. Thingol spoke in ire to Finrod, chastising him for concealing so great a matter as the kinslaying, and coming to his board \"red-handed\" from the slaying of his own mother's kin, and seeking no pardon for it. Finrod, loath to defend himself by casting blame on the other princes of the Noldor, remained silent. Angrod, however, still bitter from the words of Caranthir, spoke openly against the sons of Fëanor, and told Thingol the truth of the kinslaying, the doom of Mandos, and of the burning of the ships at [[Losgar]]. Thingol was long silent before speaking. He commanded the sons of Finarfin to depart, as his heart was hot, but that they may in time return as he would not shut his doors forever against his kin. He stated he would also keep friendship with the folk of Fingolfin, as they had atoned for such ill as they did, and that in their mutual hate of Morgoth such griefs shall be lost. But, he also decreed that Quenya shall be held as the language of those who slay kin unrepentant, and thus banned all [[Sindar]] from speaking or answering to it.<ref name=GA />{{rp|§§100-107}}\n\nIn {{FA|410}} the [[House of Bëor]] was granted the fiefdom of [[Ladros]] within Dorthonion.<ref>{{WJ|West}}</ref>\n\nIn {{FA|422}}, with the strength of Men being added to the Noldor, Fingolfin pondered an assault against Angband; he knew they lived in danger while Morgoth was free to prepare and devise whatever evils he might and reveal them at his whim. But, because their lands had grown fair, and in such an attack many would surely perish, most of the Eldar were reluctant.<ref name=GA />{{rp|§133}} Of the Noldorin princes, only Angrod and Aegnor supported this, and it ultimately did not come to pass.<ref name=Fingolfin>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>\n\nIn {{FA|455}}, Morgoth [[Dagor Bragollach|broke the Siege of Angband]] and both Aegnor and Angrod were slain in following assault.<ref name=Fingolfin />\n\n== Characteristics ==\nLike his brothers and sister, Angrod had golden hair. Early in his life he developed hands of great strength.<ref name=descendants>{{PM|Finwe}}</ref>\n\nWhen he first meets with Thingol he is described as \"being true and wisehearted\".<ref name=GA />{{rp|§63}}\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Angrod'' is the [[Sindarized]] form of '''''Angaráto''''', being a combination of ''[[ang]]'' (\"iron\") and ''raud'' (“lofty, high, noble”).<ref name=pe17>{{PE|17}}</ref>{{rp|49}}\n\n== Other names ==\nIt is probable that Angrod's [[father-name]] was, like ''Findaráto'' (Finrod), originally just '''''Aráto''''' (\"a noble”),<ref name=pe17 />{{rp|147}} and later differentiated.<ref name=descendants /> \n\nFrom his hands of great strength, he received the [[epessë]] '''''Angamaitë''''', being a combination of ''anga'' (\"iron\") and ''[[maitë]]'' (\"having a hand\", \"handed\").<ref name=pe17 />{{rp|110}}\n\nFinarfin used Angrod's epessë as a differentiating prefix, and thus Angrod ended up with the father-name '''''Angaráto'''''. This name is given in the [[Telerin]] form, with the adjectival element placed second; in [[Quenya]], the more natural form would have been ''Artanga''.<ref name=descendants /> \n\nIn ''[[The Earliest 'Silmarillion']]'', he was initially called '''Anrod'''.<ref name=\"sketch\">{{SM|2}}</ref> \n\nIn '' Ælfwine’s translation of the Quenta into Old English; Old English equivalents of Elvish names'', he is called '''Angel''';<ref>{{SM|QA1}}</ref> in Old English, this could mean either a \"fisherman's hook\", or the modern meaning of \"divine messenger\".<ref>[https://archive.org/details/anglosaxondictio00tolluoft/page/40/mode/2up ''An Anglo-Saxon dictionary : based on the manuscript collections of the late Joseph Bosworth.
