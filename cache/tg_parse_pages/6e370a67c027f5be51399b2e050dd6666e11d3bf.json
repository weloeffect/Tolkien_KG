His girdlestead was said to be crowned with opals and pearls. He lived in a white minaret towering over the [[Mountains of the Moon]]. The tower was made out of diamonds and \"tall moonstone\" and had \"an ivory door\" that was unlockable with a \"crystal key\" that he possessed.<ref name=poem6/>\n\nThe Man in the Moon was featured in the song ''[[The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late]]'',<ref name=poem5>{{AB|5}}</ref> composed by [[Bilbo Baggins]],<ref name=preface/> as well as within ''[[The Man in the Moon Came Down Too Soon]]'',<ref name=poem6/> a song derived from [[Gondorians|Gondorian]] lore.<ref name=preface/>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nIn ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]'', the Man in the Moon was mentioned in the context of Elven lore as \"an aged Elf with hoary locks\" who secretly hid on the island of the Moon alongside the [[Valar]] and [[Maiar]] and tended to the [[Moon|Rose]] of [[Telperion|Silpion]] and never slept. No other Elf among the [[Eldar]] ever learned of his experience since he never told anyone his tale.<ref>{{LT1|IX}}, p. 215</ref> He also built \"a little white turret\" there which he occasionally climbed in order to look upon the [[Eä|heavens]] or the [[Arda|Earth]]. His proper name was '''''Uolë Kúvion''''', though some unspecified people named him the Man in the Moon.<ref>{{LT1|VIII}}, pp. 192-3</ref>\n\n[[Christopher Tolkien]] mentions in his commentary that the \"isolated heading ‘Uolë and Erinti’ in the little pocket-book used…for suggestions of stories to be told\" implies that Tolkien may have considered writing a tale of how Uolë Kúvion came to live on the Moon, but never got around to writing it. A note in the same pocket-book refers to Uolë Kúvion as the '''King of the Moon''' while a second note describes a scenario in which [[Eriol]] would sing to the [[Elves]] a legend that [[Men]] have made about Uolë Kúvion. This song may be Tolkien's [[1915]] [[The Man in the Moon Came Down Too Soon|poem]]<ref>{{LT1|Why}}, pp. 204-6</ref> about the Man in the Moon.<ref>{{LT1|VIIIn}}, pp. 202, 206</ref>\n\nHis name in [[Qenya]], ''Uolë Kúvion'', as well as his name in [[Gnomish]], '''''Ûl Cuvonweg''''', both mean \"Moonking\" and the entry in the lexicon refers to him as \"the '''Moon-elf'''\". Tolkien originally write his Qenya name as '''''Uolë Mikúmi''''',<ref>{{LT1|Order}}, p. 198</ref> which also means \"Moonking\", but rejected this name.<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry \"Uolë Kúvion\"</ref>\n\n== Other writings ==\nIn Tolkien's ''[[Roverandom]]'', the '''Man-in-the-Moon''' is the greatest of all magicians and lives within a white minaret on the moon with \"an enormously long telescope\".<ref name=rover2>{{Rover|2}}</ref> He has a moon-dog named Rover and when [[Rover]] comes to the moon, he renames him \"Roverandom\" to avoid confusing the two and gives him wings to play with the moon-dog.<ref name=rover2/> After staying in the moon and having many adventures, Roverandom is told by the Man-in-the-Moon that [[Artaxerxes]] had left and returned to Earth.<ref name=rover3>{{Rover|3}}</ref>\n\nThe Man-in-the-Moon appears also within the ''[[Letters from Father Christmas]]'': In [[1926]], the [[North Polar Bear]] lit the northern lights causing the moon to break and the Man to fall into [[Father Christmas]]'s hut, eating all of his chocolate before climbing back up to mend the moon and tidy up the stars.<ref>{{LFC|1926}}</ref> He visited Father Christmas in 1927. He didn't return until the next day because the \"[[North Polar Bear|Wicked Bear]]\" pushed him under a couch and he was forgotten about. [[Dragons]] had emerged on the moon and begun to obscure it in his absence, forcing him to unleash a powerful magic of freezing in order to repel them.<ref>{{LFC|1927}}</ref>\n\n== Inspiration ==\nThe [[Wikipedia:Man in the Moon|Man in the Moon]] is a real-life tradition referring to a figure on the moon disc that appears like a face.\n\n{{References}}\n\n{{Legend}}\n\n[[Category:Characters in The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Elves]]\n[[Category:Other races]]\n[[de:Mann im Mond (Wesen)]]"}}}
