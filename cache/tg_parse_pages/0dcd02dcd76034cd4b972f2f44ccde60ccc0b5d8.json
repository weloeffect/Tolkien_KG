Part of the reason for the long delay was that Morgoth himself had been in the [[East]], corrupting [[Men]] after learning of their arising following the first emergence of the [[Sun]]; concerned by the growing union of the Eldar, however, he returned to [[Beleriand]].\n\nThe battle began suddenly with earthquakes, fire, and a multi-front assault by Morgoth's forces. These forces were repelled though, and ultimately destroyed on the plains of [[Ard-galen]] by a united force of the Eldar led by [[Fingolfin]] and [[Maedhros]]. \n\nAs a result of this battle the Eldar tightened their leaguer, establishing the long [[Siege of Angband]]. Morgoth, in turn, adopted more insidious methods, seeking to capture Eldar alive to coerce from them knowledge and skill, and to foment dissension between their kingdoms. As Morgoth's attention became fully set on the Eldar, several tribes of Men were able to escape from his worship, wondering West and eventually becoming the [[Edain]].\n\n== Background ==\nIn {{YT|1495}}, Melkor ended the [[Days of Bliss]] and ushered in the [[Long Night]] when he brought about the [[Darkening of Valinor|death of the Two Trees]], murdered [[Finwë]] the [[King of the Noldor]], and stole the [[Silmaril]]s. Morgoth, as Melkor was thereafter called, then returned to [[Middle-earth]] and re-established himself within his northern fortress of [[Angband]].<ref name=flight>{{S|Flight}}</ref>\n\nSoon after, in {{YT|1497}}, Morgoth launched his [[First Battle of Beleriand|first great assault]] against the [[Sindar]] under King [[Thingol]]. While his eastern host was destroyed by Thingol, aided by the [[Green-elves]] and [[Dwarves of the Blue Mountains|Dwarves]], his western host captured most of [[West Beleriand]], save the [[Havens of the Falas]] which were put to siege. Thingol thereafter withdrew what people he could into his realm, and Queen [[Melian]] established a [[Girdle of Melian|fence of enchantment]] about it, thus both protecting and isolating them.<ref name=sindar>{{S|Sindar}}</ref>\n\nIn that same year however, the first of the [[Noldor]], the host of Fëanor, [[Return of the Noldor|returned to Middle-earth]], having pursued Morgoth from [[Valinor]]. Morgoth rallied his forces and [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath|launched a surprise attack]] against the Noldor encampment at [[Lake Mithrim]], but though he far outnumbered them, his [[Orc]]s were no match against [[Calaquendi|Elves who had beheld the Light]], and were driven back with great slaughter. [[Fëanor]], in his wrath however, drew far ahead of the van of his host in pursuit of the fleeing Orcs, and was surrounded and mortally wounded when Morgoth's forces turned to bay, joined by [[Balrog]]s issued from Angband to aid them. Fëanor's eldest son, Maedhros, was further captured following a feigned parlay.<ref name=return>{{S|Return}}</ref>\n\nIn {{YT|1500}} a second, even greater, host of the Noldor under Fingolfin arrived in Middle-earth, having crossed the [[Helcaraxë]]. At this time also came the first rising of the [[Moon]] and [[Sun]], the later of which dismayed Morgoth and his servants, causing him to withdraw them and send forth a great reek and dark cloud to hide his lands from its light.<ref name=return />\n\nFollowing the first dawn of the Sun, Morgoth's spies brought him tidings of the [[Awakening of Men|arising of Men]] in the East. So great did Morgoth deem this matter that he himself secretly departed Angband under shadow, leaving command of the War to his lieutenant [[Sauron]].<ref>{{GA|79}}</ref> While Morgoth's purpose was ever to corrupt or destroy, with Men he also sought by fear and lies to make them the foes of the Eldar, and to then bring them out of the East against Beleriand.<ref name=ga80>{{GA|80}}</ref>\n\nThe forces of the Eldar, meanwhile, strengthened in union. In {{FA|5}} Maedhros was rescued by [[Fingon]], thus healing the feud that divided the [[house of Fingolfin]] and that of Fëanor,<ref name=return /> and in {{FA|7}}, at a [[council in Mithrim|council of the Noldor]], Fingolfin was chosen as their [[High King of the Noldor|High King]]<ref>{{GA|69}}</ref> with the [[Sons of Fëanor]] subsequently relocating to [[East Beleriand]].<ref>{{GA|70}}</ref> In {{FA|20}}, Fingolfin held a [[Mereth Aderthad|great council and high feast]] to which came many chieftains and representatives from not only the Noldor, but also of the Sindar and even the Green-elves of [[Ossiriand]]; here many councils were taken in good will and oaths were sworn of league and friendship.<ref>{{GA|72}}</ref>\n\nHearing tidings of the growing union and might of the Eldar, Morgoth returned to Angband from the East, leaving behind but few servants, and those of less might and cunning.<ref name=ga80 />\n\n== Battle ==\n[[File:Thomas_Rouillard_-_Duel.jpg|thumb|right|''Duel'' by [[Thomas Rouillard]]]]\nMorgoth, believing the reports of his spies that the lords of the Eldar were wandering abroad with little thought of war, made trial against their strength and watchfulness. In {{FA|60}}, with little warning, there were suddenly earthquakes in the North, and flames erupted from fissures in the earth, and the [[Iron Mountains]] vomited flame, and a great army of Orcs poured forth from Angband.<ref name=ga77>{{GA|77}}</ref> \n\nWhile his main host assaulted [[Dorthonion]],<ref name=qs102>{{LR|Quenta}}, §102</ref> another thrust down in the west through the [[Vale of Sirion]],<ref name=ga77 /> and still other forces passed through [[Maglor's Gap]] in the east.<ref name=qs102/> These Orcs scattered throughout Beleriand,<ref name=ga77 /> with bands straying abroad far and wide doing great evil.<ref name=qs102 /> \n\nBut the Eldar were more prepared than Morgoth thought, and Fingolfin and Maedhros gathered swiftly a great force of both Noldor and Sindar. While others sought out and destroyed the wandering Orcs within Beleriand, Fingolfin and Maedhros themselves fell against and repelled the main host at Dorthonion.<ref name=qs102 /> The Orcs were driven back into retreat across the [[Ard-galen]] where Fingolfin and Maedhros pursued them and, even within sight of [[Gates of Angband|Angband's gates]], surrounded and destroyed them.<ref name=qs102 />\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{main|Siege of Angband}}\nWhile this was a great victory for the Eldar, they also took it as a warning, and drew closer their leaguer, setting the Siege of Angband.<ref name=ga78>{{GA|78}}</ref> [[Hithlum]] in the west was held by Fingolfin and Fingon, and East Beleriand south of the [[March of Maedhros]] by the Sons of Fëanor; the lands between were held by the [[House of Finarfin]], and in the [[Pass of Sirion]], on the island of [[Tol Sirion]], [[Finrod]] established his [[Minas Tirith (Beleriand)|great watchtower]].<ref>{{GA|85}}</ref> Such was their watch that Fingolfin boasted, save by treason among themselves, Morgoth could never again escape nor come upon them unawares.<ref name=ga78 />\n\nYet neither could the Noldor take Angband, nor recover the Silmarils, nor even keep Morgoth fully fenced. From his position at [[Thangorodrim]], the Iron Mountains curved northward to either side and made for an impassable barrier, and thus in the frozen wilderness to his rear, where the Eldar were restrained from keeping watch, his spies and messengers came and went by devious routes into Beleriand.<ref name=ga78 />\n\nFollowing his defeat, Morgoth now desired to sow fear and disunion among the Eldar, and he bade the Orcs to take alive any that they could. Thus, some among the Eldar were seized by robber bands in the woods, or in over rash pursuit of their foes, and brought back to Angband where they were put to torment and duress. From them, Morgoth was able to make use of their lore and skills, and wrung the tidings and counsels of his enemies, and learned much of what befell since the [[rebellion of the Noldor]], and rejoiced in such seeds of dissension. Some of them were even so [[Spell of Bottomless Dread|daunted by the terror of his eyes]] that they required no further chains, doing his will wherever they might be, and these he released to work treason among their kin; thus, the Elves became afraid of all who claimed escape from Angband.<ref name=ga812>{{GA|§81-82}}</ref>\n\nIt was not long before dark tales began to whisper among the Sindar against the Noldor, for Morgoth chose them for the first assault of his malice, and spread evil truth enhanced and poisoned with lies. By {{FA|67}}, these tales reached Círdan, and he in turn informed Thingol. Thingol, after learning the full truth from [[Angrod]], responded by banning the use of [[Quenya]] within Beleriand, holding those who use it to be [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë|slayers of kin]] unrepentant.<ref name=ga100107>{{GA|§100-107}}</ref>\n\nEven during the Siege, war never wholly ceased, as Morgoth would ever make trial and thrusts against his enemies.<ref name=ga78 /> These were, however, restricted mostly to Orc raids and affrays on the north-marches, with the largest and most dangerous being [[Assaults_on_Hithlum#During_the_Siege_of_Angband|an attempted assault to the rear of Hithlum]] in {{FA|155}}.<ref>{{GA|115}}</ref> \n\nAs the growing strength of the Eldar, before the battle, caused Morgoth to return from the East to Beleriand, his designs to subjugate Men were not wholly achieved.<ref name=ga80 /> Following the battle, with Morgoth being restrained by the Noldor, his thought was bent to their ruin, and he gave little heed to anything else in Middle-earth. Men were therefore able to wax and multiply, and some among them had converse with the [[Avari|Dark Elves]] from whom they learned much, including language and rumour of the Blessed Realms in the West. From among these Men came those who repented, and rebelled against the Dark Power, and were in turn hunted and oppressed by those that worshipped it; they thus wondered westwards, fleeing from the darkness which Morgoth had ensnared them.<ref>{{GA|87}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Dagor Aglareb'' is [[Sindarin]] for \"Glorious Battle\",<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> it contains the elements ''[[dagor]]'' (\"battle\") + ''[[aglar]]'' (\"glory\") + ''-eb'' (adjective suffix).<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entry ''aglar''</ref>\n\nIn old English this battle was called '''Hréþgúþ''', with \"hréþ\" meaning \"glory\".<ref>{{SM|QA1}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nWhat would become the Dagor Aglareb is first described in the ''\"The first version of The Earliest Annals of Beleriand\"'', under the year 50. While it still starts with earthquakes, rather than a concentrated assault it is described as Orc-raids, which are driven back in the year 51 with the Siege being then established.<ref>{{SM|7I}}</ref>\n\nIn ''\"The second version of the earliest Annals of Beleriand\"'', this became a determinate event. Still taking place in the year 51, the driving back of Orc-raids now includes the destruction of an Orc army upon Bladorion (Ard-galen), and it is titled as the \"Second Battle\" along with being named as \"Dagor Aglareb\".<ref>{{SM|7II}}</ref>\n\nIn ''\"[[The Later Annals of Beleriand]]\"'', the date goes through an emendation from year 51 to year 60.<ref>{{LR|AB}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s ''\"[[Quenta Silmarillion (Lost Road)|Quenta Silmarillion]]\"'', the battle takes it's mostly final form. Specific new elements include the Orcs invading Beleriand both through the Pass of Sirion in the west and Maglor's Gap in the east; and of others dealing with the wandering Orcs while Fingolfin and Maedhros confronted the main host in the plains.<ref name=qs102 />\n\nIn ''\"[[The Grey Annals]]\"'', Dagor Aglareb becomes the Third Battle of Beleriand. While an army of Orcs passing through the Vale of Sirion is still included, there is no mention of Orcs passing through Maglor's Gap.<ref name=ga77 /> The largest additions, however, are not to the battle itself, but the surrounding events of Morgoth himself being in the East and returning just prior to the battle, and of his new orders following it to take Eldar as captives.\n\n==See also==\n* [[:Category:Images of Dagor Aglareb|Images of Dagor Aglareb]]\n\n{{references}}\n{{warsofbeleriand}}\n[[Category:Conflicts of the First Age]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n[[de:Dagor Aglareb]]\n[[fr:encyclo:evenements:1a:guerres:dagor aglareb]]\n[[fi:Dagor Aglareb]]"}}}
