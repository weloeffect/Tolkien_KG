Tolkien|Tolkien]] family. It was usually given to the eldest son of the eldest son. Tolkien's father, [[Arthur Tolkien|Arthur]], was the first son of [[John Benjamin Tolkien|John Benjamin]]'s second marriage; the first son of his first marriage, John, died with only three daughters. As of that moment, the name ''John'' went to Arthur's descendants.<ref name=\"L309\">J.R.R. Tolkien, [[Humphrey Carpenter]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (eds.), ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', [[Letter 309]] (dated [[2 January|January 2]], [[1969]])</ref> It passed to Tolkien's first son, [[John Tolkien|John]], who became a priest and left no children,<ref>[[Humphrey Carpenter]], ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]'', page 202</ref> so the name ''John'' has effectively lost its hereditary signififance.\n\nThe name, though Romish in nature, had at first no religious connotations. However, because his birthday ([[3 January|January 3]]) was the [[wikipedia:Octave (liturgical)|Octave]] of [[wikipedia:John the Evangelist|John the Evangelist]], Tolkien chose him as his patron.<ref name=\"L309\"/> \n====Ronald====\nArthur Tolkien's first choice for his eldest son's second child was Benjamin, after his father. Tolkien's mother, [[Mabel Suffield|Mabel]], who was confident she would receive a daughter, chose ''Rosalind''. This would become ''Ronald'' when the child turned out to be a boy.<ref name=\"L309\"/> Tolkien often used this name as his first name; most of his letters to [[Edith Tolkien|Edith]] were signed ''Ronald'', or simply ''R.''.<ref>J.R.R. Tolkien, [[Humphrey Carpenter]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (eds.), ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', [[Letter 1]], note 7 (dated October [[1914]])</ref>  \n====Reuel====\nDespite its [[wikipedia:Raguel (name)|obvious biblical connotations]], the name ''Reuel'' does not come from any of the people mentioned in the Bible; instead, it was the surname of a friend of John Benjamin.<ref name=\"L309\"/> He gave it to his son Arthur, and both his sons, John and [[Hilary Tolkien|Hilary]] had it. Even most their male children and grandchildren have it. Though this family friend was never identified, Tolkien recalled the name being of Norman origin.<ref name=\"L309\"/> In this light, it might be an early anglification of the surname ''Rouel'', which means \"(maker of) small wheels/circular objects\".<ref>Marie-Thérèse Morlet, ''Dictionnaire étymologique des noms de famille'' (1991), translated from the French: \"''en général « petite roue », a désigné en anc[ien] fr[ançais] et moy[en] fr[ançais] différents objets en forme de roue, peut être un surnom de fabricant.''\"</ref> The \"biblical\" ''Reuel'' means \"Friend of God\".<ref>[[wikipedia:Patrick Hanks|Patrick Hanks]],  Kate Hardcastle, Flavia Hodges, ''A Dictionary of First Names'', [[Oxford University Press]] (2003)</ref>\n\n====Tolkien====\n====Other Names====\n\n===Teacherhood===\n==As an Author==\n===The Philologist===\n===The Veteran===\n===The Christian===\n{{Main|Christianity}}\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''1992: ''[[Tales from the Perilous Realm (1992 radio series)|Tales from the Perilous Realm]]''\n:[[Michael Hordern|Sir Michael Hordern]], who had previously played [[Gandalf]] in the [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|1981 radio series of ''The Lord of the Rings'']], serves as narrator, who is identified as \"Tolkien\" in the credits, to all episodes.<ref>[[Tales from the Perilous Realm (1992 radio series)|''Tales from the Perilous Realm'' (1992 radio series)]], information booklet (2002 re-release)</ref> He provides the narration, paired with the main characters of each segment: [[Brian Blessed]] as [[Farmer Giles]],<ref>[[Tales from the Perilous Realm (1992 radio series)|''Tales from the Perilous Realm'' (1992 radio series)]], \"Farmer Giles of Ham\"</ref> [[Paul Copley]] as [[Smith]],<ref>[[Tales from the Perilous Realm (1992 radio series)|''Tales from the Perilous Realm'' (1992 radio series)]], \"Smith of Wootton Major\"</ref> [[Alfred Molina]] as [[Niggle]],<ref>[[Tales from the Perilous Realm (1992 radio series)|''Tales from the Perilous Realm'' (1992 radio series)]], \"Leaf by Niggle\"</ref> and [[Nigel Planer]] and [[Jonathan Adams]] as [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]].<ref>[[Tales from the Perilous Realm (1992 radio series)|''Tales from the Perilous Realm'' (1992 radio series)]], \"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil\"</ref>\n\n[[File:A Question of God - Tolkien, Lewis and Dyson.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Ian Bellman as Tolkien (left)]]\n'''2004: ''[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0433436/ The Question of God: Sigmund Freud & C.S.
