Thráin died in capture five years later in 2850 but nobody knew it, as it was Gandalf the only one to witness it, and didn't know who he was. According to [[Appendix A]], it was only in [[Third Age 2941|91 years later]], meeting Thorin, when he realised that the captured Dwarf he saw dying in [[Dol Guldur]] was Thráin, and presumably (not mentioned in the narrative) he reported it to Thorin. It is hard to believe that the Longbeards knew when their King died, or that they remained kingless almost a century until Gandalf confirmed it to Thorin; it is reasonable that Thorin succeeded his father not too long after his disappearance.</ref></ref>\n{{references|n}}\n[[Category:Third Age years|2, Third Age 2850]]"}}}
