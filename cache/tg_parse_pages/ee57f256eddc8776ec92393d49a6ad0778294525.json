Tolkien]].\n\nUnwin Hyman Ltd. was formed in 1986, as a result of the amalgamation of publishers [[Allen & Unwin]] and Bell & Hyman. Robin Hyman became chief executive of the company upon its formation, with Allen & Unwin continuing as its Australian-based subsidiary, until the firm was acquired by [[HarperCollins]] in 1990. \n\nHarperCollins has since sold Unwin Hyman's academic book list to Routledge. <ref>[https://collections.reading.ac.uk/special-collections/collections/george-allen-unwin-ltd-archive/ George Allen & Unwin Ltd.
