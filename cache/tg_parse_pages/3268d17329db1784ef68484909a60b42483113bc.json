The [[Moriquendi|Elves in Beleriand]] sought merely to exist, and Morgoth had little to do with them, but the Noldor, on the other hand, had come with the express purpose to defeat Morgoth and, particularly the [[Sons of Fëanor]], retrieve the treasured [[Silmarils]] stolen by him.\n\nEighty-eight years after the first battle, Morgoth again attacked the Noldor, and again without any success. The [[Dagor Aglareb]] (''Glorious Battle'') made the Noldor so bold as to [[Siege of Angband|besiege Angband]] for almost four hundred years.<ref name=\"Return\"/> Within the first century since the arrival of the Noldor, the settlements of [[Brithombar]] and [[Eglarest]], [[Gondolin]], [[Nargothrond]], and [[Minas Tirith (Beleriand)|Minas Tirith]] were built across all Beleriand, and both the Noldor and the Sindar were prospering under the young Sun.<ref>{{S|Noldor}}</ref>\n\nIt was during the [[Long Peace]], in the fourth century after the arrival of the Noldor, when some Men (the [[Edain]]) reached Beleriand eager to find the \"[[Gods]]\" as they believed, and entered the service of the Eldar. The [[Brethil|Forest of Brethil]] was given to the [[House of Haleth]] and [[Dor-lómin]] to the [[House of Hador]].<ref name=\"Atani\"/>\n\nHowever, the Siege of Angband was of limited effectiveness since the northern side of Angband was on the opposite side of the [[Iron Mountains]] and thus unapproachable. Indeed in the fifth century, Morgoth poured rivers of fire out of Angband, ruining the besieging Noldorin armies. The green plain of [[Ard-galen]] had been permanently laid waste by the rivers of fire, and was now called ''[[Anfauglith]]'', the Choking Dust; and the highlands of [[Dorthonion]], which had been inhabited by the Edain of the [[House of Bëor|folk of Bëor]], were made inhospitable. The [[Dagor Bragollach]] (''Battle of Sudden Flame'') began, and the Noldor eventually mustered a defence, but their losses were severe.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> It was in the years following that battle when the Man [[Beren]] rescued a Silmaril for the [[King of Doriath|Elven King]] [[Elu Thingol]].<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>\n\nLater the Noldor initiated a battle for a first time. They massed an army composed of Elves, Edain, [[Dwarves]], and the [[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterling]] houses of [[Bór]] and [[Ulfang]] allied to the [[Sons of Fëanor]]. The Elves and their allies advanced very close to Angband, but Morgoth's trickery had upset their battle plan since the folk of Ulfang proved treacherous. Τhe battle became known thereafter as [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] (''Unnumbered Tears'') from the destruction of the Elves' last hope of victory. The land of Hithlum was lost, the Sons of Fëanor were largely scattered, and the peoples of Beleriand had been decimated. [[Orcs]] of Morgoth made a [[Hill of the Slain|heap of the Elven and Mannish dead]] in the centre of Anfauglith. Realms such as the [[Falas]], Nargothrond, and Gondolin were later destroyed one by one. The [[Havens of Sirion]] were constructed as a hidden refuge by [[Círdan]].<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>\n[[File:Alan Lee - Ruin of Angband.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|''Ruin of Angband'', by [[Alan Lee]]]]\nAt last, the [[War of Wrath]] took place after [[Eärendil]] sailed to Valinor and persuaded the Valar to help those whom they had forsaken. The Valar gathered the [[Host of the Valar|Host of the West]] composed of the [[Maiar]], [[Vanyar]], and those Noldor who had stayed in Valinor. The [[Teleri]] refused their aid, due to an [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë|old offense]] dealt them by the Noldor of Beleriand, but consented to ferry the armies of Valinor in their famous ships. This battle marked the first appearance of the winged dragons, most notably [[Ancalagon|Ancalagon the Black]], but the Valar had the day. Morgoth's realm of tyranny was obliterated, and the Dark Lord himself captured and cast out of [[Arda]] into the [[Void|Timeless Void]] in {{YS|590}}, the last year of the First Age.<ref>{{WJ|Years}}, p. 346</ref> However, the entire landmass of Beleriand had been also destroyed and sunk under the [[Belegaer|Sea]] in the heat of battle.<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref>\n\nEvents that marked the end of the Age were the breaking of the [[Thangorodrim]],<ref name=\"Years\"/> the loss of the Silmarils, and the choice of the [[Half-elven]].<ref>{{App|Numenor}}, p. 1034</ref>\n\n== Terminology ==\n{{Quote|The title of this second part, ''The War of the Jewels'', is an expression that my father often used of the '''last''' six centuries of the First Age: the history of Beleriand after the return of Morgoth to Middle-earth and the coming of the Noldor, until its end.|[[Christopher Tolkien]]<ref>{{WJ|Foreword}}</ref>}}\nIn the [[Appendix B]] and the ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'' [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] never gives dates of the First Age. In works such as ''[[The Annals of Aman]]'' and ''[[The Grey Annals]]'', Tolkien measured the First Age with the Years of the Trees (YT),<ref>{{MR|P2e}}, p. 70</ref> or the Valian Years (VY) and then Years of the Sun (YS),<ref>{{GA|3-53}}, pp. 5-30</ref> respectively.\n\n[[Robert Foster]] among other scholars attempted to chronicle the First Age; by convention these sources use the Years of the Sun as \"First Age\" keeping a format similar to Appendix B. For example, the [[First Age 20|twentieth Year of the Sun]] is referred to as I 20 or F.A. 20, and the [[Tolkien Gateway]] also uses this format. It should be however pointed out that according to Foster's own remark the definition YS 1 would be more accurate than FA 1,<ref name=\"Foster\">{{HM|Guide}}, Appendix A: A Chronology of the First Age, pp. 553-7</ref> and that his text itself does not clarify when exactly the First Age began.<ref name=\"Guide\"/>\n\nUnfortunately, this convention creates the widespread [[Misconceptions#Beginning of the First Age|misconception]] that F.A. 1 was the first year of the First Age, or its beginning, marked as such by the first sunrise. This led to the [[fanon]]ical term \"Ages of the Sun\" and the misconception that the Ages measured from the first rising of the Sun. According to that definition, the First Age 'proper' followed the Years of the Trees and lasted only c. 600 years until the [[Second Age 1|beginning]] of the [[Second Age]]. \n\nHowever, in the [[Appendix F]] to the ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' J.R.R. Tolkien himself wrote explicitly that the [[Return of the Noldor]] to Middle-earth, which resulted from their Exile, took place at at the '''''end''''' of the First Age, thus meaning that the year labeled F.A. 1 was in fact placed near the end of that long Age;<ref name=\"Elves\"/><ref name=\"Peoples\"/> in the same Appendix, there is also mentioned that the Orcs were first bred by Morgoth in the Elder Days,<ref>{{App|Other}}, p. 1131</ref> i.e. in the First Age,<ref name=\"SilmIndex\"/> but this happened before Utumno was broken and demolished.<ref name=\"Captivity\"/>\n\nFurthermore, in ''The Annals of Aman'' Tolkien mentioned that the First Age ([[Ages of the Children of Ilúvatar|of the Children of Ilúvatar]]) began when the Elves awoke at Cuiviénen in {{YT|1050}},<ref name=\"Annals\"/> while in the [[The Peoples of Middle-earth|twelfth volume]] of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' he also pointed out that the First Age was the '''''longest''''' (of all Ages),<ref name=\"PM\"/> as well as in his [[Letter 131]] to [[Milton Waldman]], where Tolkien described the First Age as ''long''.<ref>{{L|131}}: \"''Several tales of victory and tragedy are caught up in it; but it ends with catastrophe, and the passing of the Ancient World, the world of the '''long''' First Age.''\"</ref>\n\nAdditionally, in ''[[The Nature of Middle-earth]]'' Tolkien also described the First Age beginning with the Awakening of the Elves and ending with the Downfall of Angband.<ref name=Nature/> Therefore, all of this signifies that the term 'First Age' is required to be expanded '''''long before''''' the first rising of the Sun, and indeed Robert Foster in his ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth|Complete Guide of Middle-earth]]'' undoubtedly defined events of the Years of the Trees following the Awakening of the Elves as an integral part of the First Age,<ref name=\"Foster\"/> as well as both [[J.E.A. Tyler]] in his ''[[The Complete Tolkien Companion|Complete Tolkien Companion]]'' and [[Paul H.
