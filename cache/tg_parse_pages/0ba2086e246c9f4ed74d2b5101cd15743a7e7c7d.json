divided into three time periods, known as the [[Days before days]], [[Years of the Trees]] and [[Years of the Sun]]. A separate, overlapping chronology divides the history into 'Ages of the Children of Ilúvatar'. The first such Age began with the Awakening of the Elves during the Years of the Trees and continued for the first six centuries of the Years of the Sun. All the subsequent Ages took place during the Years of the Sun. Most Middle-earth stories take place in the first three Ages of the Children of Iluvatar.\n\n===Music of the Ainur===\n{{main|Music of the Ainur}}\n\nThe supreme deity of Tolkien's universe is called [[Ilúvatar|Eru Ilúvatar]]. In the beginning, Ilúvatar created spirits named the [[Ainur]]. Ilúvatar made divine music with them. [[Morgoth|Melkor]], who was then one of the Ainur, broke the harmony of the music, until Ilúvatar began a third theme which the Ainur could not comprehend since they were not the source of it. The essence of their song symbolized the history of the whole universe and the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] that were to dwell in it &mdash; the [[Men]] and the [[Elves]].\n\nThen Ilúvatar created [[Eä]], the universe itself, and the Ainur formed within it Arda, the Earth, \"globed within the void\": the world together with the airs is set apart from ''Kuma'', the \"void\" without. The first 15 of the Ainur that descended to Arda, and the most powerful ones, were called Valar, and the Ainur of lesser might that followed were called Maiar.\n\n===Days before days===\n{{main|Days before days}}\n\nThe '''Days before days''' began shortly after the creation of Arda by the [[Valar]]. After the Valar entered the world, there was a light veiling the ground. The Valar took this light and concentrated it into two large lamps, [[Illuin]] and [[Ormal]]. In a version, the Vala [[Morgoth|Melkor]] forged great pillars, one in the furthest north, and another in the deepest south. The Valar lived in the middle, at the island of [[Almaren]]. The end of the Days before days was marked by [[Morgoth|Melkor]]'s destruction of the Two Lamps.\n\n====Spring of Arda====\n{{main|Spring of Arda}}\nThe '''Spring of Arda''' was a period of peace and flourishing during the Days before days that started when the [[First War]] between the Valar ended.\n\n===Years of the Trees===\n{{main|Years of the Trees}}\n\nShortly after the destruction of the Two Lamps, [[Yavanna]] made the [[Two Trees]], named [[Telperion]] (the silver tree) and [[Laurelin]] (the gold tree) in the land of [[Aman]], where the Valar now lived. The Trees illumined Aman, leaving Middle-earth in darkness.\n\nThe [[Awakening of the Elves|Elves awoke]] in [[Cuiviénen]] when the stars were Rekindled, beginning the [[Ages of the Children of Ilúvatar]]. Many, though not all, of the [[Elves]] were persuaded to go on the [[Great Journey]] westwards towards Aman. Along the journey several groups of Elves tarried, notably the [[Nandor]] and the [[Sindar]].  The three clans that arrived at Aman were the [[Vanyar]], [[Noldor|Ñoldor]] and the [[Teleri]].\n\nThe Valar had captured Melkor and placed him in chains in Aman.  After he appeared to repent and was released, he sowed great discord among the Elves, and stirred up rivalry between the Ñoldorin King [[Finwë]]'s two sons [[Fëanor]]  and [[Fingolfin]]. Out of jealousy and hatred for the Silmarils&mdash;three gems crafted by Feänor that contained the light of the Two Trees&mdash;he stole them, killing Finwë who was guarding the jewels; then with the help of the creature [[Ungoliant]] he destroyed the Two Trees and escaped to Middle-earth.\n\nBitter at the Valar's inactivity, Feänor and his house left to pursue Melkor, cursing him with the name 'Morgoth'. A larger host, commanded by [[Fingolfin]] followed him. They reached the Telerin port-city of [[Alqualondë]], and were forbidden to use the Telerin ships. Feänor decided to take them by force and thus the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë|first Kinslaying]] ensued and only by the strength in numbers were the Teleri overcome and their fair ships stolen.\n\nFeänor's host sailed on the vessels, and burned them when he arrived in Middle-earth. Left behind, Fingolfin and his company crossed over to Middle-earth through [[Helcaraxë|the Grinding Ice]] in the far north.  Around the same time, but separately, Galadriel and Celeborn set sail for Middle-earth without the permission of the Valar.\n\n===Years of the Sun===\n{{main|Years of the Sun}}\nThe Years of the Sun began when the Valar made the Sun and the Moon out of the final fruit of [[Laurelin]] and the final flower of [[Telperion]] and set them in the heavens. Thereafter years were reckoned in Middle-earth as they are in our own real world. The First Age of the Children of Ilúvatar continued into this new reckoning of time.\n\n==== First Age's Years of the Sun ==== \n{{main|First Age}}\n\nFeänor was soon lost in an attack on Morgoth's [[Balrogs]] - but his sons survived, and founded realms; the kingdoms of the House of Fingolfin.\n\nThe Long Peace lasted hundreds of years; during which time [[Men]] arrived over the [[Blue Mountains]].  But the peace was not to last; and one by one the kingdoms &mdash; even the hidden ones of [[Gondolin]] and [[Doriath]] &mdash; fell.\n\nAt the end of the age, all that remained of free Elves and Men in [[Beleriand]] was a settlement at the mouth of the River [[Sirion]] and another settlement on the isle of Balar. [[Eärendil]] had possession of a Silmaril, which his wife [[Elwing]]'s ancestors [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] had taken from Morgoth. But the Feänorians had a claim on the Silmaril still and so there was another Kinslaying.  Eärendil and Elwing took the Silmaril across the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]], to beg the Valar for aid.\n\nThey responded.  Melkor was exiled into the Void; and most of his works were destroyed. This came at a terrible cost, as [[Beleriand]] itself was sunk.\n\n====Second Age====\n{{main|Second Age}}\n\nThe Men who had remained faithful were given the island of [[Númenor]], in the middle of the Great Sea; whilst the Elves were allowed to return home.\n\nThe Númenoreans became great seafarers, but became jealous of the Elves for their immortality. Meanwhile, in Middle-earth it became apparent that [[Sauron]], Morgoth's chief servant, was still active. He worked with Elven smiths in [[Eregion]] on the craft of rings, and forged [[the One Ring]] to dominate them all. The Elves noticed this and removed theirs.\n\nTowards the end of the age, the Númenoreans were growing increasingly proud. King [[Ar-Pharazôn]] humbled even Sauron and brought him to Númenor as a hostage. Sauron worked his way into Pharazôn's court, and became high priest in a cult of Melkor.  Eventually, Pharazôn was persuaded to attempt to invade Aman, promised that immortality would result.\n\n[[Amandil]], chief of the faithful, sailed westward to warn the Valar of this. His son [[Elendil]] and grandsons [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]] prepared to flee eastwards. When the King's men had landed on Aman, the Valar lay down their guardianship of the world and called for Ilúvatar to intervene.\n\nThe world was changed into a sphere, and the straight road from Middle-earth to Aman was broken.  Númenor was utterly destroyed, as was the fair body of Sauron. Elendil and his sons founded the realms of [[Gondor]] and [[Arnor]].\n\nSauron arose again and challenged them. The Elves allied with the Men to form the [[Last Alliance]] which defeated him.  His One Ring was taken from him by Isildur, but not destroyed.\n\n====Third Age====\n{{main|Third Age}}\n\nThe Third Age saw the rise in power of the realms of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]], and their fall. Arnor was divided into three petty Kingdoms, which fell one by one, whilst Gondor fell victim to [[Kin-strife]], plague, wainriders, and corsairs.\n\nBy the time of ''The Lord of the Rings'', [[Sauron]] had recovered again, and was seeking the One Ring. He discovered that it was in the possession of a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] named [[Bilbo Baggins|Baggins]], and sent out the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]] to find him and retrieve it.\n\nThe Ring-bearer, [[Frodo Baggins]], is sent to [[Rivendell]], where it is decided that the One Ring must be destroyed once and for all &mdash; and it can only be unmade in the fiery depths of [[Mount Doom]] where it was forged.  He sets out on this quest with eight other companions who comprise ''The Fellowship of the Ring''.\n\nAfter a long and difficult journey, he and [[Samwise Gamgee]] finally complete the mission, succeeding largely due to an unforeseen event that was out of their control. [[Sauron]] is thus destroyed forever and they are lauded as heroes.\n\n[[Aragorn]] takes his place as King of the [[Reunited Kingdom]] of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]], at last restoring the line of Kings from the [[Stewards of Gondor]].\n\n====Fourth Age and after====\n{{main|Fourth Age}}\n\nThe end of the Third Age marked the end of the involvement of the Elves in Mannish affairs, despite a short-lived revival of Elven presence in Gondor under [[Legolas]]. Most Elves that have lingered in Middle-earth leave for Valinor &mdash; those that remain behind \"fade\", and eventually diminish. A similar fate happens to the Dwarves: although [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] becomes an ally of the [[Reunited Kingdom]] and there are indications [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] is refounded, and a colony is established under [[Gimli]] in the [[White Mountains]], they become ever more reclusive, and disappear from mannish history. Morgoth's creatures are almost wiped out and never recover. During the later Fourth Age the tales of the earlier Ages turn into legends, until they are eventually thought of as fantasies, as the heirs of the Númenóreans forget their heritage.\n\nTolkien imagined that he lived perhaps about 6000 years after the [[War of the Ring]], [[Ages#Further future|in the Fifth, Sixth or Seventh Age]].\n\n==End of Arda==\n{{main|Dagor Dagorath}}\nAfter contemplating [[Arda Marred|Arda's decay]], the Elves could deduce that Arda had to come to an end. There are also many mentions of this end happening with a Last Battle after Morgoth's return. After his defeat, it is said that Men and Ainur will make a [[Second Music of the Ainur|Second Music]] in front of Ilúvatar.\n\n[[Category:Chronology]]"}}}
