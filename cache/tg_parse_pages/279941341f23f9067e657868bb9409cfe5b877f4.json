The two villages were connected by the [[Causeway]], which traversed the Marish. The [[Stock-brook]] traversed the region.<ref name=part>{{FR|Part}}</ref><ref name=short>{{FR|Mushrooms}}</ref>\n\nIt was boggy and especially difficult to traverse, full of bogs, ditches, briars and fences. To the east, the landscape phased into well-tended fields and meadows, with hedges, gates and dikes for drainage. Between the two villages was the lane to [[Bamfurlong]], and five miles north of that was the road to the [[Bucklebury Ferry]].<ref name=short/>\n\n==History==\nMarish was occupied by [[Hobbits]] that came later into the Shire than other Hobbits, mostly [[Stoors]] who arrived around {{SR|30}}, from the south. The folk of the Marish began the habit of building farm-houses and barns which later spread to the rest of the Shire.<ref name=hobbits/>\n\nIn {{SR|379}}, [[Bucca of the Marish]] was elected [[Thain]] to rule the Shire in the stead of the former [[King of Arthedain]].<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> Marish was the home of the [[Oldbucks]], and Thainship, for several centuries; that was until Bucca's descendant Thain [[Gorhendad Oldbuck]], left the Marish in {{SR|740}}<ref>{{App|Brandybuck}}</ref> to colonize [[Buckland]] and became its first Master. Thainship passed to the [[Tooks]], but many farmers of the Marish acknowledged the authority of the [[Master of Buckland]] rather than that of the Thain.<ref>{{FR|Conspiracy}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[Frodo Baggins]]'s trek across the Shire, he and his companions on [[25 September]] left the road in the [[Green Hills]] and a shortcut across the Marish to the Ferry. They followed the course of the Stock-brook and rested in a wooded belt, while the land was roamed by at least two [[Black Riders]].<ref name=short/>\n\n==Culture==\nHaving arrived later and separately from most Shire hobbits, the folk of the Marish had many peculiar names and strange words in their speech (see: [[Stoorish]]). The Stoors were the only hobbits who wore boots in muddy weather; the inhabitants of the Marish were mostly house-dwellers<ref name=hobbits>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref> the flat and boggy land being obviously unsuitable for the burrowing of [[hobbit-holes]]. [[Bamfurlong]] was the home of [[Farmer Maggot]], stoutly built of brick, with a high wall all around it, protected by three large dogs. \n\nThe [[Shire-hobbits|Shire-folk]] in this region were more cautious than their fellow Hobbits who lived farther from the borders, and so they sought protection from the dangers beyond the River. Farmer Maggot was intolerant to tresspassers and kept ferocious dogs for protection.<ref name=short/>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Marish.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Marish in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Marish forms the south-eastern endpoint of the in-game Shire region, as the [[Southfarthing]] is not present in the game.\n\n{{References|note}}\n[[Category:Regions of the Shire]]\n[[Category:Swamps]]\n[[de:Bruch]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/regions/comte/maresque]]\n[[fi:Neva]]"}}}
