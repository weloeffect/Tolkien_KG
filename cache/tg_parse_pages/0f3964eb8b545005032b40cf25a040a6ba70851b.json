Not all these refugees came with the same intentions: a group of [[ruffians]] was ousted from the town near the end of {{TA|3018}}. With the help of [[Bill Ferny]] and [[Harry Goatleaf]], they returned soon after New Year, and a fight ensued. The number of casualties on the side of the ruffians was not recorded, but five of the Bree-folk, three Men and two Hobbits, were killed. Mat Heathertoes was one of them.<ref name=\"Bound\">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Return of the King]]'', \"[[Homeward Bound]]\"</ref> \n\n==Etymology==\n''Mat'' was a name employed by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] to translate the common (but untranslated) Hobbit name '''Matta'''.<ref name=\"AppF\">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[Appendix F]]'', \"II: On Translation\"</ref> The name '''Heathertoes''' was, like all surnames of the Men of Bree, a plant name,<ref name=\"Pony\">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', \"[[At the Sign of the Prancing Pony]]\"</ref> though this seems to have escaped Tolkien when he wrote [[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings|a list for translators]]. In it he said ''Heathertoes'' was a Hobbit name, and was given in joke to the unshod Hobbits. While walking, they would gather twigs and moss between their toes.<ref name=\"nomen\">{{HM|N}}, page 759</ref> However, Mat was most certainly a Man: given that two of the five were Hobbits,<ref name=\"Bound\"/> and the last two named victims - [[Willie Banks]] and an [[Underhill Family|Underhill]] were both positively identified as Hobbits as well.<ref name=\"Pony\"/><ref name=\"nomen\"/>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''\n:Though the \"set-to\" with the ruffians is mentioned by Butterbur, he does not give the names of the casualties.<ref>[[Brian Sibley]], [[Michael Bakewell]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', \"[[Homeward Bound (episode)|Homeward Bound]]\"</ref>\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Mat Heathertoes is an impoverished man of Bree living in Beggar's Alley with a half-starved pony.
