They were known as the \"Fair-elves\" from the fair colour of their hair.\n\n==History==\nAccording to legend, the clan was founded by [[Imin]], the first [[Elves|Elf]] to awake in [[Cuiviénen]], his wife [[Iminyë]], and their twelve companions. At this time, they were called the '''Minyar''' (Quenya \"first ones\"). \n\nHowever, it was [[Ingwë]], the first Vanya to travel with [[Oromë]] to [[Valinor]], who became their king. Always eager to reach Valinor, none of the Vanyar [[Avari|refused to go]] and were on the vanguard of the [[Great March]]; they reached [[Beleriand]] first and sailed on the first voyage of [[Tol Eressëa]] with the [[Noldor]].<ref name=\"s3\" /> \n\nAt first the Vanyar dwelt in [[Tirion]] with the [[Noldor]], but they loved the light of the [[Two Trees of Valinor]] and settled in the plains and woods of [[Valinor]] or the slopes of [[Taniquetil]].<ref name=\"princes\" /> Their King Ingwë became the ''[[High King of the Elves]]'' and lived on Taniquetil beneath the halls of [[Manwë]].<ref name=\"princes\">{{S|Princes}}</ref>\n\nAfter the release of [[Melkor]], they were suspicious of him, being content within the [[Light of Valinor]].<ref>{{S|6}}</ref> In the [[Darkening of Valinor]] they were next to the [[Valar]] and [[Maiar]] inside the [[Ring of Doom]].<ref>{{S|8}}</ref>\n\nA notable Vanya was [[Indis]], the second wife of [[Finwë]] and mother of [[Fingolfin]] and [[Finarfin]]. Her second son Finarfin inherited her golden hair and passed it on to his children, including [[Galadriel]].

The Noldor, because of their love for gold, regarded this a beautiful trait.<ref name=\"clan\">{{WJ|C}}</ref>{{rp|382–3}} The term probably originated around the time of the Sundering,{{fact}} if somewhat later.
