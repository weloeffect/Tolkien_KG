Then it gives a description of [[Lúthien]] their daughter, and tells how [[Beren]] watched in amazement. [[Dairon]] warns Lúthien, and she hides, but Beren touches her arm by accident. Again Beren searches, and months later catches her again, naming her Tinúviel. Below is recounted the second meeting.\n\n==Concerning the Canto==\nThis canto, in contrast to the previous one, shows peace and hope, and the beauty of Doriath.\n\n{{blockquote|...the rocks were ringing<br />\nthe birds of Melian were singing|vv. 409-410}}\n\nIt tells of the meeting and love of Thingol and Melian, mirroring in a way the future meeting and love of Beren and Lúthien; one elf to [[maia]], the other man to elf.\n\n{{blockquote|There after but an hour, him seems,<br />\nhe finds her where she lies and dreams<br />\npale Melian with her dark hair<br />\nupon a bed of leaves. Beware!<br />\nthere slumber and a sleep is twined!<br />\nHe touched her tresses and his mind<br />\nwas drowned in the forgetful deep<br />\nand dark the years rolled o'er his sleep.|vv. 445-452}}\n\nThis canto also includes the short paragraph about the minstrels: Tinfang Gelion, Maglor, and Dairon, the first of which has only this place laid aside for him in all the known writings of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]].\n\n{{blockquote|[[Tinfang|Tinfang Gelion]] who still the moon<br />\nenchants on summer nights of June<br />\nand kindles the pale firstling star;<br />\nand he who harps upon the far<br />\nforgotten beaches and dark shores<br />\nwhere western foam for ever roars<br />\n[[Maglor]] whose voice is like the sea;<br />\nand Dairon, mightiest of the three.|vv. 503-510}}\n\nBeren's mixture of sorrow and bliss and the fleeing of Lúthien is shown, and at the last when he catches her in the vivid description of her dancing it culumnates.\n\n{{blockquote|'Tinúviel! Tinúviel!'<br />\nHis voice such love and longing filled<br />\none moment stood she, fear was stilled;<br />\none moment only; like a flame<br />\nhe leaped towards her as she stayed<br />\nand caught and kissed that elfin maid.|vv. 740-745}}\n\nThen is a paragraph unlike the rest of the Lay, unless it were Thingol's thoughts of pity on Lúthien; a sort of cry from the poet to the one he writes about, asking her why she took her doom, and left elven immortality.\n\n{{blockquote|A! Lúthien! A! Lúthien!<br />\nmore fair than any child of Men;<br />\nO! loveliest maid of Elfinesse<br />\nwhat madness does thee now possess!|vv. 748-751}}\n\nOn a final note, she slips away \"just at the breaking of the day\"."}}}
