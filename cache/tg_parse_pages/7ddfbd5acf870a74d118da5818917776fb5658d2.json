were one of the seven kindreds of [[Dwarves]] whose leaders were from the [[House of Durin]].  Their first king was named [[Durin]], who was one of the seven [[Fathers of the Dwarves]].<ref name=\"Durin\">{{App|Durin}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Elder Days===\nIn the deeps of time, the [[Fathers of the Dwarves]] awoke, Durin was the eldest and woke first. He slept alone under Mount [[Gundabad]]. As he wandered south along the [[Misty Mountains]] he came upon a valley he named [[Azanulbizar]]. In the caves above the lake he called [[Kheled-zâram]], he founded the city of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], the home of Durin's Folk. Durin lived there so long he became known as Durin the Deathless, yet in the end, he died before the end of the [[First Age]].<ref name=\"Durin\"/>\n[[File:Turner Mohan - Durin.jpg|left|thumb|''Durin'' by [[:Category:Images by Turner Mohan|Turner Mohan]]]]\nThe [[Dwarves of Khazad-dûm]] also colonized the [[Iron Hills]], which became Durin's Folk's primary source of iron-ore.<ref name=relations>{{PM|Relations}}, pp. 302-303</ref> The [[Old Forest Road|Dwarf-road of Mirkwood]] ran north-east to the Hills for the use of dwarf-traders and merchants between Khazad-dûm and the Hills.<ref name=Notes>{{PM|XNotes}}, p. 323 (note 30)</ref> Durin's Folk also considered the [[Grey Mountains]], which lay between these two mansions, to be within their territory. Those lands were harassed by [[Orcs]], but during the [[Battles of Beleriand|War of the Jewels]], they were called to [[Beleriand]] as [[Morgoth]] needed all available power, and the lands were left at peace.<ref name=relations/>\n\nWhen [[Men]] first migrated west into [[Rhovanion]] and [[Eriador]], they encountered Durin's Folk. The Men looked at the Dwarves with awe and were eager to learn from them.<ref name=relations/>\n\n===Second Age===\nAfter the [[War of Wrath]] and the breaking of [[Thangorodrim]], the ancient cities of [[Nogrod]] and [[Belegost]] in the [[Blue Mountains]] had been ruined.  In the [[Second Age]], about the year {{SA|40|n}},<ref name=\"SA\">{{App|SA}}</ref> many Dwarves who lived in these cities left the destruction behind and came to Khazad-dûm, increasing its wealth and power.<ref name=\"Durin\"/> The Longbeards controlled [[Erebor]], [[Ered Mithrin]], [[Ered Engrin]], and the eastern side of the [[Misty Mountains]] up to [[Lórien]].<ref name=Notes/>\n\nAlso in that time, Morgoth's Orcs, now leaderless and reckless, but still numerous, armed and cruel, returned to the East and started harassing the Dwarven lands again, as well as the more numerous Men who settled between the Grey Mountains and [[Mirkwood]]. In the battles that followed Dwarves and Men were threatened. The Dwarves, outnumbered, were glad to make alliance with Men. Men chiefly provided food in exchange for Dwarven work in building, road-construction, mining, and the crafting of tools and weapons.<ref>{{PM|XNotes}} #28</ref> At first, this system benefited the Dwarves, as the services they provided to Men required less effort than those offered in exchange, till Men became wiser and developed skills of their own. With less work to provide food by their own, the Dwarves were free to continue with pursuing their labour and refine their skills.<ref name=relations/>\n\nWith better weapons and protection, and riding skills of their own, enabling them to function as mounted scouts and archers, Men could watch and defend the plains and vales where no Orc could then venture without danger. Thus the [[Alliance of Dwarves and Men]] was formed, resulting to mutual respect and also warm friendship.<ref name=relations/> During this period the Longbeards adopted the [[Northern Mannish|speech]] of Men, keeping [[Khuzdul|their own language]] to themselves.<ref name=relations/><ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref>\n\nIn {{SA|750|n}}, the [[Noldor]] established a new realm in [[Eregion]].  Being close to Khazad-dûm they established a friendship with Durin's Folk unlike any before between [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]]. Both peoples were enriched, and the Elves (seduced by [[Sauron]]) forged the [[Rings of Power]] (the forging began about {{SA|1500|n}} and one of these was given to [[Durin III]], according to the dwarves by [[Celebrimbor]] himself, in Khazad-dûm<ref name=\"Durin\"/>). In {{SA|1697|n}}, Eregion was [[Sack of Eregion|destroyed]] by Sauron, and the gates of Khazad-dûm were shut<ref name=\"SA\"/> and remained so throughout the [[Dark Years]] of Sauron's dominion. Durin's Folk stayed enclosed in Khazad-dûm, which was unassailable from without; its wealth remained unravished, but communication between the [[Dwarves of Khazad-dûm]] and the [[Dwarves of the Iron Hills]] was cut off.<ref>{{PM|Relations}}, p. 306</ref> \n\nIn the [[War of the Last Alliance]] in {{SA|3434|n}}, Durin's Folk sent forces to fight alongside the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]].<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref>\n\n===Third Age===\nDuring the reign of [[Durin VI]] in the [[Third Age]], the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm delved deeper and deeper for [[mithril]], which had become increasingly harder to find. In {{TA|1980|n}} however, they accidentally awoke a hidden [[Balrogs|Balrog]] that had fled from the First Age and killed King [[Durin VI]]. Finally in {{TA|1981|n}} his son [[Náin I]] was also killed and all the people of Khazad-dûm were either killed or fled far away.<ref name=\"Durin\"/>\n\nMost of Durin's Folk escaped to the north where in {{TA|1999|n}}<ref name=\"TA\">{{App|TA}}</ref> [[Thráin I]] established a new capital within [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], becoming [[King under the Mountain]]. By the [[Watchful Peace]] most Longbeards gathered to the [[Grey Mountains]] and King [[Thorin I]] left Erebor in {{TA|2210|n}}<ref name=\"TA\"/> and travelled further north to settle there also.  For a time they prospered there for the mountains were rich.<ref name=\"Durin\"/>\n\nUnfortunately, there were [[dragons]] in the wastes north of the Grey Mountains, and in {{TA|2570|n}} they began [[War of the Dwarves and Dragons|making war]] against the Longbeards. The conflict came to a climax in {{TA|2589|n}} when King [[Dáin I]]<ref name=\"TA\"/> and his second son [[Frór]] were killed by a great [[Cold-drakes|cold-drake]] outside [[Dáin's Halls|his hall]].<ref name=\"Durin\"/>  Soon after, most of Durin's Folk left the Ered Mithrin with [[Grór]], Dáin's third son, leading many followers to the Iron Hills in {{TA|2590|n}}.<ref name=\"TA\"/>\n\nIn the same year, Dáin's first son and heir, [[Thrór]], with his uncle [[Borin]] and the remainder of the departing Longbeards, returned to Erebor. There they prospered, winning the friendship of all Men nearby, and trafficking in ore with their kin in the Iron Hills.<ref name=\"Durin\"/> News of the wealth of Erebor spread and reached the dragons, and in {{TA|2770|n}} [[Smaug]] suddenly descended upon the Mountain, and [[Sack of Erebor|sacked]] it.<ref name=\"TA\"/>  Although many Dwarves were killed, many escaped as well. Among them were King Thrór and his family who headed south into a long homeless wandering while most of the surviving Longbeards headed east to the Iron Hills.<ref name=\"Durin\"/>\n[[File:Turner Mohan - The Heir of Durin.jpg|thumb|''The Heir of Durin'' by [[:Category:Images by Turner Mohan|Turner Mohan]]]]\nThe followers of Thrór eventually settled in [[Dunland]]<ref name=\"Durin\"/> where in {{TA|2790|n}} Thrór left \"to see what I can find.\"<ref name=\"TA\"/> With a companion, [[Nár]], he came to the east gate of Khazad-dûm and entered as a returning heir. For days Nár waited in hiding outside until Thrór’s body was tossed from the gates by the Orc-chieftain [[Azog]], who told Nár to go warn his kin never to return to Moria. Nár went back to [[Thráin]], Thrór's son to report what had happened. Now King and filled with anger, Thráin II sent word to all the houses of the Dwarves to prepare for war.<ref name=\"Durin\"/>\n\nBy {{TA|2793|n}} the Dwarves had mustered a great host. Durin's Folk and large forces from the other Houses were ready to launch a [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs|war of vengeance]].<ref name=\"TA\"/> For six years, From Gundabad to the [[Gladden River|Gladden]], they sacked and assaulted every Orc dwelling they could find. Defeating the [[Orcs]] through strength, matchless weapons, and burning anger.<ref name=\"Durin\"/>\n\nAt last on a dark winter day in {{TA|2799|n}} the Dwarf-host came to Azanulbizar<ref name=\"TA\"/> and found a great host of Orcs awaiting them. Undeterred, the Dwarves, led by Thráin II, made their assault, beginning the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]]. This final battle too the Dwarves won, but at great cost.  In the end, Azog was beheaded and Thrór was avenged, but the Dwarves could not take Khazad-dûm, for within still dwelt Durin's Bane.\n\nWith the war over, the Dwarves dispersed.  [[Dáin Ironfoot]] led his contingent of Longbeards back to the Iron Hills. Thráin II, with [[Thorin]], [[Balin]], [[Glóin]], and others of their following returned to Dunland. Soon though they uprooted and wandered in Eriador until they established themselves in the northern [[Ered Luin]] beyond the [[Lhûn|Lune]]. There they prospered and their numbers slowly grew.<ref name=\"Durin\"/>\n\nThráin II decided to return to Erebor in {{TA|2841|n}} but as he travelled, he and his companions were pursued by Sauron's servants.  One day in {{TA|2845|n}} Thráin was captured and imprisoned in [[Dol Guldur]]. Eventually, in {{TA|2850|n}}, [[Gandalf]] found him and received the key to Erebor, but the last of the [[Seven Rings]] had been taken and Gandalf was unable to rescue the Dwarf.<ref name=\"TA\"/>\n\nKing Thorin II Oakenshield and his people continued to labour and traffic in the Ered Luin until one day Thorin sought and found Gandalf to solicit his counsel and aid in dealing with Smaug.  Gandalf devised a plan for burglary, employing the service of [[Bilbo Baggins]] of [[the Shire]]. The plan succeeded and Smaug was slain, but in the subsequent [[Battle of Five Armies]] Thorin was killed.  However, his cousin Dáin Ironfoot, who led a contingent of Dwarves in the battle, entered Erebor and restored the Kingdom under the Mountain as King Dáin II.<ref name=\"Durin\"/>\n\nDurin's Folk grew strong in Erebor until during the [[War of the Ring]] their realm and that of the [[Kingdom of Dale]] were attacked by Sauron's northern forces.  In the [[Battle of Dale]] in {{TA|3019|n}} King Dáin II fell and thereafter the Mountain was besieged. Upon the news of Sauron's downfall, however, the besieged routed the army of Sauron and Dáin's son, [[Thorin Stonehelm]] became the King under the Mountain as Thorin III.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>\n\n===Later history===\nAfter the fall of Sauron, [[Gimli]], the son of Glóin, brought some of Durin's Folk from Erebor south to [[Glittering Caves|Aglarond]] and there established a new Dwarf-realm.  Gimli served as the [[Lord of the Glittering Caves]].<ref name=\"Durin\"/>\n\nEventually, a descendant of [[Thorin III Stonehelm]], [[Durin VII]], led [[Durin's folk]] from [[Erebor]] back to [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] and restored the ancient kingdom sometime after {{FoA|171}}. There they remained \"until the world grew old and the Dwarves failed and the days of Durin's race were ended.\"<ref name=\"Making\">{{PM|Aiv}}, p. 278-9</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n\nIn the Lost Tales, the Longbeards (the Indrafangs) were living in [[Belegost]].<ref>[[J.R.R.
