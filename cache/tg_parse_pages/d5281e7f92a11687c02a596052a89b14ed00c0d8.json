According to the lore of the [[Elder Days]], [[Aulë]] and his people made a vessel to carry to the silver flower aloft, and [[Tilion]], one of the hunters of [[Oromë]], was granted the task of steering the new Moon through the sky.<ref name=\"Sil\">Of {{HM|S}}, [[Of the Sun and Moon and the Hiding of Valinor]]</ref>\n\nTilion guided his charge up into the western skies just as [[Fingolfin]] and his people were crosssing [[Helcaraxë]], helping them to illuminate their hard way to [[Middle-earth]], and so the end of the [[Darkening of Valinor|Long Night]] and the ages of the [[Stars]] was marked. After seven lunar \"days\" the [[Sun]] also rose. The Moon first rose above [[Valinor]] in the far West of the World, but [[Varda]] came to change this arrangement, so that the Moon would pass beneath the World, and arise in the east instead, as it does to this day. Even as the Moon rose above the darkness in the west, Fingolfin's host blew silver trumpets and began its march into Middle-earth, and the shadows of the Noldor went long and black before them.<ref name=\"Sil\" />\n[[File:Darryl Elliott - Moon.jpg|thumb|''Moon'' by Darryl Elliott]]\nAccording to the legends of the [[Elves]], Tilion was an unsteady steersman, sometimes dwelling overlong beneath the Earth, or appearing in the sky at the same time as the Sun. He was drawn to the bright new Sun, launched from Valinor shortly after his own vessel,<ref name=\"Sil\" /> and his coming too close to his fiery companion was said to account for the darkening of the Moon's face.\n\nAccording to a tradition,<ref>{{HM|SM}}</ref><ref>{{HM|LR}}</ref> Melkor will discover how to break the [[Door of Night]], and will destroy both the Sun and the Moon.\n\n==Lore of the Moon==\n===Númenóreans===\nFor the Númenóreans, the [[Sun]] and the '''Moon''' - ''Ûri'' and ''Nîlû'', called collectively also ''Ûriyat'' (\"two suns\") or ''Ûrinîl(uw)at'' (\"two sun-moon\") - were personified entities, the [[Man in the Moon]] and the [[Lady of the Sun]].<ref name=\"Drowning\">[[J.R.R.

The [[Man in the Moon]] is described in those writings as being an old Elf who secretly hid on the island of the Moon, and built his minaret there.<ref name=\"LT1VIII\" /> This is alluded to further in Tolkien's ''[[Roverandom]]'', where the Man in the Moon also lives in a Minaret.\n\nOther Elvish names in this fase were:\n*'''''Celebron''''': [[Gnomish]] name for \"Moon\".<ref name=\"Telimpe\">{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry \"Telimpë\"</ref>\n*'''''Crithosceleg''''': Gnomish name meaning \"disc of glass\".<ref name=\":0\">{{LT1|VIII}}, p. 192</ref>\n*'''''Gilthalont''''': unclear [[Gnomish]] name with the elemnent ''giltha'' (\"white metal\").<ref name=\"Ilsalunte\" />\n*'''''Ilsaluntë''''': [[Qenya]] name meaning \"silver boat\".<ref name=\"Ilsalunte\">{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry \"Ilsaluntë\"</ref>\n*'''''Minethlos''''': Gnomish name meaning \"argent isle\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n*'''''Rána''''': Qenya name for \"Moon\" used by the Gods.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*'''''Sil''''': Qenya name for \"Moon\" used by the fairies, literally \"Rose\".<ref name=\"Silindril\">{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry \"Silindril\"</ref>\n*'''''Silindril''''': Qenya name meaning \"Moon-cauldron\".<ref name=\"Silindril\" />\n\n===Later concepts===\nIn the [[Round World version of the Silmarillion|Round World]] version of the legendarium, the Sun and the Moon were not the fruit of the Two Trees, but actually preceded the creation of the Trees. Instead, the Trees preserved the light of the Sun before it was tainted by Melkor when he ravished [[Arien]].\n\n==Inspirations==\n===Gender===\n[[File:Mani and Sol.jpg|thumb|A depiction of the Norse god Máni and the goddess Sól (Lorenz Frølich, 1895) who could be the inspirations of Tilion and [[Arien]]]]\nThe fact that the Moon in Tolkien's legendarium is connected to a male entity or person (like Tilion or the Man in the Moon), is obviously derived from the Germanic mythology of which Tolkien was an expert; for example the Old Norse [[Wikipedia:Máni|Máni]] is a male lunar god and [[Wikipedia:Sól|Sól]] is a female solar goddess.\n\nOn the contrary, other mythologies of the world had connected the Moon with the feminine, like the Græco-Roman deities [[Wikipedia:Luna|Luna]], [[Wikipedia:Selene|Selene]], [[Wikipedia:Hecate|Hecate]] and others. \n\nThe gender of the celestial deity is mirrored also in the gender of the noun for \"Moon\" in these languages (eg. French ''la Lune'' but German ''der Mond''). This was also perhaps the case with some of the [[languages]] of [[Arda]] ([[Ghân-buri-ghân]] refers to the Sun as a woman).\n\n:''See also [[Sun#Inspiration|Sun: Inspiration]]''\n\n===Phases===\n{{quote|...my moons in the crucial days between Frodo's flight and the present situation (arrival at Minas Morghul) were doing impossible things, rising in one pan of the country and setting simultaneously in another.|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s letter to [[Christopher Tolkien]], [[24 April]] [[1944]]<ref>{{L|69}}, p. 80</ref>}}\nTolkien was very careful in the moon phases described in his works, so that they fit the passing of days realistically. Tolkien was remodelling the phases while reviewing the book in [[1944]] so that he preserves the consistency. The moon phases described in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' correspond to the phases of years [[1941]]-[[1942|2]] and it is probable that he used a recent calendar for reference.<ref>http://shire-reckoning.com/moon.html</ref> Unfortunately, some minor errors (that can be detected only after thorough measurement and astronomical knowledge) slipped his attention (for example cf. [[22 September|September 22]])\n\n===Calendar===\nThe mention that Hobbits and Dwarves based their year and months on the Moon, mirrors the [[Wikipedia:lunar calendar|lunar calendar]] used by several ancient cultures through history, such as the Hebrews. The observation of the Moon phases formed the months; the words are even related etymologically in some languages (cf. the English words \"Moon\" and \"month\").\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring (video game) - Legolas firing an arrow.JPG|200px|thumb|The Moon in [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]]]\n'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''\n:The moon appears in the background of various scenes.
