He followed [[Théoden]] to [[Minas Tirith]] and it was he who first reported a change in the wind during the long ride, a change that augured the end of [[Sauron]]'s looming darkness.<ref>{{RK|V5}}</ref> He fought in the ensuing [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry \"Widfara\"</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Wídfara'' is [[Old English]] for \"far, wide traveller\". \n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2013: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Wídfara comes from the [[Wold]]. When a remote region of Wildermore stops sending messengers, [[Harding (rider of Rohan)|Harding]] sends a group of riders to check on them, including Wídfara. The group is ambushed and the few survivors are scattered. Wídfara's horse Windfoot is killed and he himself sustains a wound, after which he slowly makes it to the village of Scylfig on foot. There he is found by the party of the player, [[Gléowine]] and [[Horn (rider of Rohan)|Horn]].\n:Wídfara later recovers from his wounds and returns to the [[Wold]] just in time to answer the muster of the Rohirrim. He rides with Harding's men to the summons and is met again by the player in the [[Drúadan Forest]]. He survives the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Widfara}}\n\n[[Category:Characters in The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:Rohirrim]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n\n[[de:Wídfara]]\n[[fi:Wídfara]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/hommes/3a/hommes du nord/rohirrim/widfara]]"}}}
