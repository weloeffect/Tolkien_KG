By the end of the [[Third Age]] it was more or less a universal language spoken throughout the [[races]] and peoples of the [[Westlands]], thus it was also known as the '''Common Speech'''.\n\nWestron, through its ancestor [[Adûnaic]], was distantly related to other native languages of the [[Middle Men]] of the Westlands, like [[Northern Mannish]] of [[Rhovanion]], and [[Rohanese]]; all descended from the [[Taliska|ancient languages]] of the [[Edain]].<ref name=\"lang\">{{App|F1}}</ref><ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, Note 4</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tree of human tongues expanded.jpg|thumb|Genealogy of Middle-Earth's human languages]]\nThe Westron speech is derived from the [[Adûnaic]] tongue of [[Númenor]].<ref name=\"L144\">{{L|144}}</ref> The [[Númenoreans]] brought it to the western coastlands of the continent of [[Middle-earth]] when they established trade outposts and forts in the third millennium of the [[Second Age]]. Westron originated as a creole language spoken between the Númenoreans and the native [[Middle Men]], and from those Númenorean colonies it spread to most of the westlands.\n\nAfter the [[Downfall of Númenor]], the [[Faithful]] Númenoreans neglected their 'unfaithful' language in favour of [[Elvish]], allowing Adûnaic as spoken in Middle-earth to change and evolve chaotically among the Middle Men. But later it was enriched and softened under Elvish influence.\n\n===Distribution===\nIn the course of the [[Third Age]] Westron was adopted by nearly all [[Men]] and [[Hobbits]] that lived within the borders of the old kingdoms of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]] all along the coasts from [[Umbar]] northward to the Bay of Forochel, and inland to the [[Misty Mountains]] and the [[Ephel Dúath]] and north up the river [[Anduin]] to the [[Gladden Fields]] between the [[Misty Mountains]] and the Anduin. At the time of the [[War of the Ring]] Westron was still the native tongue in this area.<ref name=\"lang\" /><ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #59</ref> [[Hobbitish]] itself was a rustic dialect of Westron. \n\nFor this, Westron was also known as the '''Common Speech'''. [[Dwarves]] used Westron as a public language, as [[Khuzdul]] was private. Some [[Elves]] also spoke Westron, although some, like [[Haldir]]'s brothers, didn't leave their lands much and had not learned the Common Speech.<ref>{{FR|Lorien}}</ref> Even [[Orcs]] spoke Westron, which was the base of [[Orkish]] tongues.<ref name=\"lang\" /><ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref> \n\nThe [[Northmen]] also spoke Westron, such as [[Beorn]] and the [[Lake-men]].<ref>{{HM|H}}</ref> The [[Woses]],<ref>{{RK|V5}}</ref> the [[Dunlendings]]<ref>{{TT|Deep}}</ref> and the [[Rohirrim]] were examples of Men whose language was not Westron, but they spoke it in interlingual circumstances.<ref name=\"lang\" /> \n\nUnder King [[Thengel]] of Rohan (who had lived in Gondor for many years before taking the throne), the Common Speech began to be used as the language of the court instead of their native [[Rohanese]] (thus [[Théoden]], [[Éomer]], and [[Éowyn]] were all functionally bilingual in Rohirric and Common Speech) \"though not all thought this a good thing...\"{{fact}}\n\n==Grammar==\nWestron had both [[wikipedia:T-V distinction|\"deferential\" and \"familiar\" pronouns]] for the second (and sometimes third) person, but the deferential pronouns had fallen out of use in the [[Hobbitish]] dialect. Interestingly, this is the opposite of what happened in English, where the familiar \"thee/thou\" fell out of favour and the deferential \"you\" became universal.\n\nThis lack of a deferential pronoun and universal use of the familiar pronoun is what [[Gondorians]] were referring to when they repeatedly remarked that Hobbit-speech sounded strange.<ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology and names==\nWestron is a translation of the original name '''''Adûni'''''<ref>{{PM|X}}, p. 316</ref> (cf. [[Adûnaic]] ''[[Adûn]]'' (\"west\")), and \"Common Speech\" translates the Westron term '''[[Sôval]] [[Phârë]]'''<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, note 6, p. 55</ref>, of identical meaning. In [[Sindarin]] the language was called '''[[Annúnaid]]''' (Westron), or '''[[Falathren]]''' (Shore-language).<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, The Languages at the End of the Third Age, p. 32</ref>\n\n==Translation==\nAccording to Tolkien's fiction, Westron was the language spoken and understood by the protagonists of ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref name=\"L144\" /> Many names of characters and places, in the book's \"reality\", were in Westron.\n\nHowever, Tolkien mentions that Westron was presented as having been completely replaced by [[Modern English]] in the text. This had certain important implications: first of all, proper names with derivations understandable or evident to speakers of Westron had been translated, to preserve the effect to the English reader. Thus, names like ''Baggins'', ''Bagshot Row'', ''Peregrin'', ''Rivendell'' et cetera, are not the ''actual'' names as spoken by the characters but are presented as ''translations''. \n\nOf course, outside the fictional context of the story, it is clear that there was no such \"translation\": the English names came first and the \"original\" forms in Westron or other languages were devised by Tolkien later.  \n \n[[Rivendell]] (\"cloven valley\") was actually called ''[[Rivendell#Etymology|Karningul]]'', and [[Bag End]] was actually called ''[[Labin-nec]]'', after ''[[Baggins Family|Labingi]]'', the real form of [[Baggins Family|Baggins]]. In some cases the explanations became quite involved, such as the river Brandywine (Sindarin [[Baranduin]], \"golden-brown river\") being actually called ''[[Branda]]-[[nîn]]'', a punning Westron name meaning \"border-water\", which was later punned again as ''[[Bralda]]-[[hîm]]'' meaning \"heady ale\".\n\nThis logic went one step further by also presenting all [[Mannish]] languages akin to Westron in languages related to English, so that their \"understandability\" by the protagonists would be simulated to the English reader.<ref name=\"L144\" />\n\nThis utter replacement of Westron by English was taken so far that some sources that should give actual Westron have been turned to English too. For instance, in [[Moria]], an illustration of the runic text on [[Balin]]'s gravestone is given. The text is said to be written in both Khuzdul and Westron. But while the first part of the inscription seems to really be a bit of Khuzdul, the second part is actually plain English, just written in [[cirth]].\n\n==Corpus==\nThe corpus of Westron is small; several of the Westron forms given above were not published in Tolkien's lifetime. Tolkien never worked out Westron to the same extent as [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]] or even [[Adûnaic]].\n\nMany words come from [[Appendix F]] and the creation of it in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]''. A detailed Westron phonology and additional grammar notes can be found in the manuscripts that Tolkien sold to the archives of [[Marquette University]] (they were initially written for the [[Appendix F]] of ''The Lord of the Rings'')<ref>[[Tyalië Tyelelliéva 17]], p. 20</ref>. These documents include declensions of animate and inanimate nouns and the present tense conjugation of the verb ''pūt-'' “to blow”<ref name=\":0\">[[Tyalië Tyelelliéva 17]], pp. 37-44</ref>; their content was partially published in [[Tyalië Tyelelliéva 17|''Tyalië Tyelelliéva'' 17]] in [[2001]]. Even now, the corpus is small (roughly 150 words).<ref>{{Cite web|articleurl=https://drive.google.com/file/d/18EwnCZh56n2MoyTEBjotpP4rQAl8nsOC/view|articlename=Westron full dictionary|author=|dated=2025}}</ref><ref>[[Tyalië Tyelelliéva 17]], pp. 37-44</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Westron words|Category:Westron words]]\n\n==External links==\n*{{webcite|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=https://ardalambion.net/westron.htm|articlename=Westron - ''the Common Speech''|dated=|website=[[Ardalambion]]|accessed=29 December, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20241230205035/https://folk.uib.no/hnohf/westron.htm|archivename=Westron - ''the Common Speech''|archivedate=30 December, 2024}}\n*{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://drive.google.com/file/d/18EwnCZh56n2MoyTEBjotpP4rQAl8nsOC/view?usp=sharing|articlename=Complete Westron dictionary|dated=|website=|accessed=29 September, 2025|archiveurl=|archivename=|archivedate=}}\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{languages}}\n\n[[Category:Westron]]\n\n[[de:Westron]]\n[[fi:Westron]]\n[[fr:encyclo/langues/westron]]"}}}
