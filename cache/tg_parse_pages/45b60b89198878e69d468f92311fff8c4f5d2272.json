He usually wrote as '''Lin Carter'''; known pseudonyms include H.P. Lowcraft (for an H.P. Lovecraft parody) and Grail Undwin.\n\nCarter was influential as a critic of contemporary fantasy and a pioneering historian of the genre. His book reviews and surveys of the year's best fantasy fiction appeared regularly in ''Castle of Frankenstein'', continuing after that magazine's [[1975]] demise in ''The Year's Best Fantasy Stories''. His early studies of the works of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] (''[[Tolkien: A Look Behind The Lord of the Rings]]'') and H.P. Lovecraft (''Lovecraft: A Look Behind the Cthulhu Mythos'') were followed up by the wide-ranging ''Imaginary Worlds: The Art of Fantasy'', a study tracing the emergence and development of modern fantasy from the late nineteenth century through the 1970s.\n\nAs an editor for [[Ballantine Books]] from [[1969]]-[[1974]], Carter brought several obscure yet important books of fantasy back into print under the ''Adult Fantasy'' line. He also helped new authors break into the field. Carter was a fantasy anthologist of note, editing a number of new anthologies of classic and contemporary fantasy for Ballantine and other publishers. \n\nTogether with ''Swordsmen and Sorcerers' Guild of America (SAGA)'' he sponsored the Gandalf Award, an early fantasy equivalent to science fiction's Hugo Award, for the recognization of outstanding merit in authors and works of fantasy. It was given annually by the ''World Science Fiction Society'' from [[1974]] to [[1980]]. Its primary purpose continues to be fulfilled by the initially rival ''World Fantasy Awards'', first presented in 1975.\n\n==Bibliography, selected==\n===Books===\n*[[1969]]: ''[[Tolkien: A Look Behind The Lord of the Rings]]''\n*[[1969]]: ''[[The Young Magicians]]'' (editor)\n*[[1973]]: ''Imaginary Worlds: The Art of Fantasy''\n*[[1977]]: ''[[Middle Earth: The World of Tolkien Illustrated]]'' (with David Wenzel)\n===Articles, Forewords, etc===\n*[[1976]]: ''[[Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers]]''\n**\"Introduction: Neomythology\"\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lin_Carter Lin Carter at Wikipedia]\n\n[[Category:Authors|Carter, Lin]]\n[[Category:American people|Carter, Lin]]\n[[Category:People by name|Carter, Lin]]"}}}
