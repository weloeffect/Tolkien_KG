They are greeted by [[Galadriel]], [[Celeborn]], and [[Elrond]], who says ''\"The [[Sea]] calls us home\"''. The elder hobbit smiles, and eagerly gets aboard the ship. \n\nGandalf smiles and Merry, Pippin, and Sam hold back tears as the [[wizard]] tells them their [[Fellowship]] is finally at an end. He walks towards the awaiting ship and turns back to them and says ''\"It is time, Frodo\"''. A realisation forms on the faces of the other three hobbits that Frodo will be departing [[Middle-earth]]; he tells them that [[the Shire]] has been saved, but not for him. ''\"You don't mean that\"'', Sam says desperately. Frodo hands him a [[Red Book of Westmarch|red book]], saying that the last pages are for him. Turning to Merry and Pippin, he hugs them each in turn, before turning back to Sam. The two hobbits look at each other before they embrace for the last time, Sam weeping on Frodo's shoulder. \n\nA smiling Gandalf boards the ship with Frodo; on the deck, the hobbit turns around and smiles at his three friends. As the ship departs, Merry and Pippin begin to leave, but Sam tarries on the shore, watching until the ship passes out of view. \n\n\nThe scene transitions to [[the Shire]], where Sam is returning home. A narration by Frodo says that Sam's part in the story will go on, as Sam is greeted by his daughter and family. He kisses his wife, [[Rosie Cotton]], and looks around him before saying \"Well, I'm back\". \n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King scenes|76]]"}}}
