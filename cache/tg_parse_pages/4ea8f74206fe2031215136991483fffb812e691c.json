Titmass''' was a [[Man]] who lived in [[wikipedia:Great Britain|Britain]] during the early [[wikipedia:21st century|21st century]].<ref name=\"Foreword\">{{SD|2b}}, p. 156</ref>\n\n== History ==\nMr. J.R. Titmass was a famous \"historian of [[wikipedia:20th century|twentieth-century]] [[Oxford]]\". When Mr. [[Howard Green]], the school clerk of the [[wikipedia:Examination Schools|Examination Schools]] in Oxford found the disordered bundle of [[The Notion Club Papers]] in the basement, Titmass assisted him in deciphering the papers in any way that he could. Indeed, it was Titmass who discovered that the name \"[[Nicholas Guildford]]\", used by the reporter of the [[Notion Club]], was in origin derived from ''[[The Owl and the Nightingale]]'',<ref name=\"intro\">{{SD|2a}}, p. 149</ref> a medieval dialogue that was once read in Oxford.<ref name=\"Foreword\"/>\n\nAfter the publication of the first edition of the papers at an unknown date, Titmass informed Green that he couldn't \"find any record in the\" [[1940]]s of any of the other names given in the Papers. As a result, Green changed his view, writing in his Second Edition foreword in [[2014]] that he now assumed that if any such club existed at that period, the names would have to be pseudonyms.<ref>{{SD|2b}}, ''Note to the Second Edition'', pg. 158</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nIn an early version of the Foreword, J.R. Titmass's original surname was '''Titmouse''' before [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] changed this to Titmass.<ref name=\"intro\"/>\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Titmass, J.R.}}\n\n[[Category:Characters from the later Ages]]\n[[Category:English people (in-universe)]]\n[[Category:The Notion Club Papers]]"}}}
