There, he was \"but just war-high\" when he fought at his father's side against [[Melko]] in the war which ended with the captivity of the Enemy. In that story Telimektar had \"a long sword girt about his waist by a silver girdle.\"<ref name=\"War\">{{LT1|IV}}, p. 101</ref>\n\nHis next mention is during the [[Darkening of Valinor]], where he was pursuing Melko along with the other [[Valar]].<ref>{{LT1|VI}}, p. 154</ref>\n\n=== Later history ===\nAccording to one text, when Melko broke free of his second imprisonment (after the [[March of Liberation]]), he went to [[Tol Eressëa]] in order to sow dissension between the [[Gnomes]] and the [[Solosimpi]], who sent for help to [[Valinor]]. However, the only aid that came from the Valar was that of Tulkas, who in secret sent his son Telimektar to Tol Eressëa to aid them.\n\nThere, Telimektar, with the help of [[Ingil]]<ref group=\"note\">In ''[[The Cottage of Lost Play]]'', it is said that Ingil eventually returned to Valinor, which seems to represent a different, distinct idea from the one mentioned above.</ref> son of [[Inwë]], surprised Melko and wounded him, and chased him up the [[Pine of Tavrobel]] all the way to [[Ilwë]]. However, Melko kept attacking the [[Sun]] and the [[stars]], and in the end caused the death of [[Urwendi]] the steerer of the Sun-vessel.\n\nFinally, the Valar decided to cut down the great Pine, which left Melko stranded out of the world.\n\nHowever, Telimektar and Ingil had to remain in the sky, guarding ceaselessly until Melko's return in the [[Great End]]. There, [[Varda]] periodically gives him [[stars]] to replace the ones Melko destroys and to remind the world of the Valar's watch - and the constellation of [[wikipedia:Orion (constellation)|Orion]] is afterwards seen as his image in the sky.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''4''', pp. 281-2</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''Telimektar''<ref group=\"note\">In the later outlines of the ''Lost Tales'', his name is given as '''''Telumektar''''' instead.</ref> is in [[Qenya]].<ref name=\"Eld\">{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1989343939.html|articlename=ᴱQ.

It is a Gnomish word adopted into Qenya, being derived from ''[[mavar]]'' (\"shepherd\") through Gnomish ''[[mord]]'' - its meaning being a poetic one for \"man, warrior\" or otherwise possibly derived from the \"warlike qualities of the shepherds\". A similar name was '''''Taimordo''''' ('''''Taimondo''''' being a corrupt form of the name), with '''''Daimort''''' (changed from ''Daimord''<ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 29</ref>) being its Gnomish cognate.<ref>{{PE|12}}, p. 62</ref><ref group=\"note\">The true Qenya cognate of ''Daimord'' was '''''Taimavar''''', with the other forms given above being corruptions of the name.</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-76152031.html|articlename=G.
