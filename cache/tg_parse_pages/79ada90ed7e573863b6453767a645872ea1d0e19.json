The island later became known as [[wikipedia:Ireland|Ireland]].<ref name=\"Osse\">{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''5''', p. 283</ref>\n\n== History ==\nIn the Faring Forth, a great expedition by the [[Elves]] of Tol Eressëa for the rescue of their kin in the [[Great Lands]], the island of Tol Eressëa was dragged across the [[Belegaer|Ocean]] from the West, and anchored near the shores of the Great Lands.\n\nThe [[Valar|Vala]] [[Ossë]], angered at the uprooting of the island that he himself has set in its place in the West ages ago, attempted to drag it back to [[Valinor]]. However, the island broke apart, and the western portion of what was once Tol Eressëa became its own island, which the Elves named Íverin, but which would eventually be called ''Ireland'' by [[Men]].<ref name=\"Osse\"/>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''Íverin'' is in [[Qenya]], however, its meaning is unclear.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2160452099.html|articlename=ᴱQ.

[[1920]], following several similar earlier outlines, the ''Book of Lost Tales'' was reimagined so that Tol Eressëa was no longer identified with what would eventually become the [[wikipedia:British Isles|British Isles]], and the character of [[Eriol]]/Ottor Wǽfre from the 5th century northern Germany was replaced by [[Ælfwine]], an Anglo-Saxon living in the [[wikipedia:11th century|11th century]] [[wikipedia:England|England]].\n\nAt the beginning of the text, it is said that the land of England was broken in the \"warfare of the Gods\", and that the part that was broken was afterwards called ''Ireland''.<ref>{{LT2|VIb}}, p. 312</ref>\n\nIt is speculated by [[Christopher Tolkien]] that, since the story of ''Ælfwine of England'' doesn't include the earlier conception of the dragging of Tol Eressëa across the ocean and its breaking apart by Ossë, the breaking off of Ireland possibly refers to the earliest idea of what would, in the later legendarium, become the cataclysm at the end of the [[First Age]] and the breaking of [[Beleriand]] during the [[War of Wrath]].<ref>{{LT2|VIb}}, pp. 323-4</ref>\n\nAccording to one other, contemporary text, it is said that in later ages, most of the [[Ilkorindi|Lost Elves]] still left east of Valinor and Tol Eressëa, congregated either in the islands of [[Luthany|Lúthien]] or Íverin.<ref>{{PE|12}}, p. 2</ref>\n\n=== Later legendarium ===\nThe island of Ireland is mentioned several times in some of the later stories such as ''[[The Lost Road]]'' and ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]'', both in the conversation between the protagonists of the story (especially in reference to the story of [[Saint Brendan]],<ref>{{SD|69}}, pp. 261, 264</ref> and the poem ''[[Imram]]''<ref>{{SD|Imram}}, pp. 296, 299</ref>),<ref>{{SD|66}}, p. 234</ref><ref>{{SD|69}}, p. 267</ref><ref>{{LR|P1III1}}, p. 39</ref> and as a stopping point in Ælfwine's journey to Tol Eressëa.<ref>{{SD|70}}, pp. 278-9</ref><ref>{{LR|P1III3}}, pp. 80-1</ref>\n\n{{references|notes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Iverin}}\n[[Category:Great Lands]]\n[[Category:Islands]]\n[[Category:Locations in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Qenya locations]]\n[[Category:Tol Eressëa]]"}}}
