The track features \"The Edge of Night\", a song sung by [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] in the halls of [[Denethor]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''. The song greatly resembles ''[[A Walking Song]]'' sung by [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], and Pippin in the chapter \"[[Three is Company]]\". The song was also used in the first trailer for ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]''.\n\n==Text==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nHome is behind, the world ahead,\nAnd there are many paths to tread\nThrough shadow to the edge of night\nUntil the stars are all alight.\n\nMist and shadow, cloud and shade,\nAll shall fade, all shall fade.\n</poem>\n\n==See also==\n*[[A Walking Song]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:2.04}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King - The Complete Recordings]]"}}}
