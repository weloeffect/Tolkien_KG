It was also prophesied that he could not be killed unless it was by the greatest [[Wolves|wolf]] that ever lived; in this case a [[werewolf]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tuuliky - Celegorm the Fair.jpg|thumb|left|''Celegorm the Fair'' by [[:Category:Images by Tuuliky|Tuuliky]]]]\nHuan was given by Oromë to his friend [[Celegorm]], one of the [[Sons of Fëanor]] and accompanied him on his huntings in the regions of [[Valinor]]. When the [[Noldor]] under [[Fëanor]] rebelled, Huan went with his master to [[Middle-earth]]. Presumably he was with his master while he dwelt in [[Himlad]], and then when he retreated to [[Nargothrond]] by the late 5th century after their arrival.\n\nHuan was with Celegorm and [[Curufin]] who were hunting when he smelled [[Lúthien]] and captured and brought the maid before Celegorm. She had set out to rescue [[Beren]], who had gone with [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] to [[Angband]] but had been captured in [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]]. Celegorm and Curufin did not reveal to her that they had sent Beren to his death by the hand of [[Sauron]], and took her as a prisoner to Nargothrond, \"for her own protection\", secretly plotting to wed her to Celegorm and thereby force an alliance with Lúthien's father [[Thingol]].\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Lúthien Escapes Upon Huan.jpg|thumb|left|''Lúthien escapes upon Huan'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nHuan felt pity for Lúthien, and sought her out and so he became involved with the [[Quest for the Silmaril]]. Speaking for the first time, he told her of a way to escape, and then accompanied her to [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]] where, with the help of Lúthien's [[magic]], he killed all of Sauron's [[Werewolves]] until Sauron himself came out, taking the shape of the greatest wolf that had ever lived. Huan nevertheless managed to defeat him, and Sauron was forced to flee. Huan went back to his master, while Lúthien and Beren went on their way back to [[Doriath]]. They came across Celegorm and Curufin, who had been exiled from Nargothrond by [[Orodreth]] when he learned of their deeds. Curufin tried to kill Lúthien, but Huan turned against his master, defending Beren and Lúthien.\n\nSpeaking for the second time, Huan told Beren and Lúthien of his plan to gain entrance to Angband, bringing them the skin of the werewolf [[Draugluin]] and the bat-skin of Sauron's messenger [[Thuringwethil]]. Using these skins as disguise Beren and Lúthien went to Angband, while Huan hunted in the wild.\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Huan's Leap 2.jpg|thumb|right|\"Huan's Leap\" by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nAfter Beren and Lúthien had won the [[Silmaril]] but Beren had lost his hand to the werewolf [[Carcharoth]], Huan joined Beren, Thingol, [[Beleg|Beleg Cúthalion]] and [[Mablung]] in the [[Hunting of the Wolf]]. Huan and Beren managed to kill Carcharoth, but Huan was mortally wounded, as was Beren. Speaking for the third and last time, he wished Beren and Lúthien farewell, and died, with Beren's palm upon his head.<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Huan.mp3|Ardamir}}\n''Huan'' means \"great dog, [[Hounds|hound]]\" in [[Sindarin]]<ref>{{S|Index}}, entry \"Huan\"</ref> and [[Quenya]].<ref>{{LR|P3}}, entry \"KHUGAN\"</ref> See also [[root]] [[KHUG]].\n\n==Origin and nature==\nIn a c. [[1959]] essay on the nature of Orcs, Tolkien speculated on whether speaking creatures such as Huan and the [[Eagles]] could be of [[Maiar|Maia]]<ref name=\"MR409-11\">{{MR|Myths}}, pp. 409-11</ref> origin.<blockquote>''But true 'rational' creatures, 'speaking peoples', are all of human / 'humanoid' form. Only the Valar and Maiar are intelligences that can assume forms of Arda at will. Huan and [[Thorondor|Sorontar]] could be Maiar - emissaries of Manwe. But unfortunately in The Lord of the Rings [[Gwaihir]] and [[Landroval]] are said to be descendants of Sorontar.''</blockquote>In the same c. 1959 essay he would speculate that Huan and the Eagles may not possess [[Fëa|fëar]], but are instead beasts elevated by the Valar:<blockquote>''In summary: I think it must be assumed that 'talking' is not necessarily the sign of the possession of a 'rational soul' or fëa. (...) The same sort of thing may be said of Huan and the Eagles: they were taught language by the Valar, and raised to a higher level - but they still had no fëar''</blockquote>However, in a note written on the paper containing the essay, Tolkien includes Huan as an example of a Maia clad in beast form<ref>{{MR|P5VIII}}, note 4</ref>:<blockquote>''...As the Valar would robe themselves like the Children, many of the Maiar robed themselves like other lesser living things, as trees, flowers, beasts. (Huan.)'' </blockquote>A later text dating from c. [[1970]] would state that the Eagles were Maiar<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Carl F. Hostetter]] (ed.), ''[[The Nature of Middle-earth]]'', \"Part Three. The World, its Lands, and its Inhabitants: VIII. Manwë's Ban\", Footnote #3, p. 308</ref>, leaving Huan's spiritual status inconclusive.{{references|notes}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:Dogs]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Noldorin names]]\n[[Category:Other races]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n[[de:Huan]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/animaux/chiens/huan]]\n[[fi:Huan]]"}}}
