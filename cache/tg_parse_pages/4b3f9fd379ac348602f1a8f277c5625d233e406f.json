They were delighted by its waters and its woods, and the [[Vanyar]] and the [[Noldor]] settled for a time on the eastern banks of the [[Anduin]]. And since there were some [[Maiar]] there with them, who protected them from the evils of [[Melkor]] and [[Sauron]], they were content for a while.<ref name=Aty/><ref group=\"note\">The Teleri, led by [[Elwë]] (and his brother [[Olwë]]) arrived a bit later, going around the south of the great [[Mirkwood|Forest]] that occupied the lands east of the river.</ref>\n\nHowever, after many years of living there, either due to the actions of [[Sauron]], or because [[Oromë]] withdrew his protection to get the Elves to move along, their new homes were struck by terrible weather and life grew hard for them. For the most part, this convinced the Eldar to continue on their journey westwards - crossing the Anduin (which was wild and flooded due to the great snowstorms in the [[Misty Mountains]]) on the boats of the [[Teleri]]. But many of these Teleri were against this and they elected to stay: these became the [[Nandor]].<ref name=Aty/>\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Atyamar'' means \"second-home\" in [[Quenya]].<ref>{{NM|P1vii}}, Note 12, p. 56</ref>\n\n{{references|notes}}\n[[Category:Elven realms]]\n[[Category:Quenya locations]]\n[[Category:Regions]]\n[[Category:Rhovanion]]"}}}
