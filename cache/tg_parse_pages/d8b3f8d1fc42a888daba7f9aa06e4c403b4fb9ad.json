Tolkien]]'s work.\n==Synopsis==\n{{blockquote|J.R. R. Tolkien has been revered as the father of twentieth-century fantasy; however, many initially criticized him for his handling of the textual matter as male-centric magical lands that did not feature prominent female roles or significant female characters. This book will highlight the vast community of powerful female figures that Tolkien created in his fantasy writing, stemming from the distinct and dominant female forces he created in his academic translation and poetry.<br>\nThese fierce women serve as a culmination of the powerful forces of women and female character that originated in Medieval, Norse, and Celtic traditions. They help to create the framework from which Tolkien shaped his female community, not merely as singular figures, as previously featured, but as a dynamic network of figures who shape Tolkien's creative art. For the first time, this discussion looks at the entire community of women, featuring previously excluded figures from his academic works and highlighting translation bias in modern manuscripts of the extant medieval works that influenced these women. It also seeks to create a comprehensive guide and detailed appendices exploring the female characters and influences throughout his writing portfolio.\n<br><br>\nThis book seeks to uncover the hidden voices of the past to find their rightful home in the strong female voices of the present, rewriting history to regain a sense of the past.}}\n\n==Contents==\n* Acknowledgements  \n* Introduction  \n** The Medieval Triptych and Tolkien's Art  \n** Creating the Triptych framework—Performative voices in Tolkien's literature  \n** Establishing Tolkien's Medieval Framework through the Critics' Eye – The Tolkien Debate  \n** Linking History to Female Autonomy and Translation Bias in Tolkien's Opus  \n** Foundations of Female Power – The Scholarly Discussion of Translation Bias  \n** Women as a Central Focus of Tolkien's art  \n** Tolkien's Evolutionary Women  \n\n* Foreword, by [[John D.
