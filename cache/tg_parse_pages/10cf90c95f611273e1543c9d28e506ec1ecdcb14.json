He was the Lord of [[Deeping-coomb]] and of much other land in the [[Westfold]] during the [[War of the Ring]].\n \n==History==\nErkenbrand had been an officer in the [[King's Company|King's Riders]] in his youth. At the time of the War of the Ring Erkenbrand was Lord of Deeping-coomb and much other land in the Westfold. As such, he was the chief lord in the [[West-mark]].<ref>{{UT|11b}}, fourth paragraph</ref> He was the uncle of [[Dúnhere]].<ref name=\"UTnote13\" />\n \nErkendbrand was in the [[Hornburg]] during the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]]. When news of the death of [[Théodred]] in the First Battle of the Fords of Isen on [[25 February]], {{TA|3019}} reached Erkenbrand the next day, he assumed command of the West-mark. Erkenbrand sent errand-riders to [[Edoras]] to inform King [[Théoden]] about the death of Théodred and to request [[Éomer]] and all forces that could be spared as reinforcements. However, [[Gríma]] delayed any actions until he was defeated by [[Gandalf|Gandalf.]]<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, thirteenth paragraph</ref> He gave the command in the field to [[Grimbold]] until he could come himself to the battlefield. Erkenbrand did not immediately go to the battlefield due to the fact that he was occupied for three days gathering all those able to bear arms and stores of food to defend the Hornburg.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, fourteenth paragraph</ref>\n\nOn [[2 March]], {{TA|3019}},<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> the [[Second Battle of the Fords of Isen]] was fought, and the defences on the [[Isen]] were driven back by [[Saruman]]'s forces. The survivors, led by Grimbold and [[Elfhelm]], were retreating from the fords of the river Isen when they came across Gandalf. Gandalf told them Théoden sought the refuge of the Hornburg, and that they should join Erkenbrand to attack the besiegers.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref> They arrived with a thousand men at dawn of [[4 March|March 4]], {{TA|3019}} and turned the tide of the [[Battle of the Hornburg]].<ref name=\"Deep\">{{TT|Deep}}</ref> \n\nErkenbrand did not come to [[Minas Tirith]] to fight in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].
