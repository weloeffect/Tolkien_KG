Most of it is found in the [[Poetic Edda|Poetic]] and the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose_Edda Prose Edda]. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] borrowed many Norse concepts and storylines for his own [[legendarium]], like [[Éowyn|the Shieldmaiden]] and the race of [[Dwarves]]. The names of many of Tolkien's Dwarves, as well as that of [[Gandalf]], are taken from the ''[[Völuspá]]''. \n\n[[Elves]] also appear in the Norse sagas. Tolkien's Elves have the human-like stature and beautiful appearance of the Norse elves, rather than the miniature fairy-like size of elves in later folklore. He also borrowed the concept of [[Calaquendi|Light Elves]] and [[Moriquendi|Dark Elves]] from the Norse. However, in [[Middle-earth]] this does not refer to morality or appearance but to whether an Elf has seen the holy light of [[Valinor]] and the [[Two Trees]].\n\nOther creatures in the legendarium are also derived from Norse myths. [[Trolls]] frequently appear in Scandinavian legends, originally as a negative synonym for the Jotuns (giants) and later as a distinct creature. Tolkien derived the [[Wargs]] from the [[Old Norse]] word ''vargr'' and its [[Old English]] equivalent ''wearg'', a word meaning both \"wolf\" and \"strangler, choker\". The giant wolves of Norse mythology, such as [[wikipedia:Fenrir|Fenrir]], were referred to as ''vargr''. Additionally, Tolkien's [[Barrow-wights]] take inspiration from the ''[[wikipedia:Draugr|draugar]]'' of Norse mythology, undead creatures that lurk in tombs and barrows guarding treasure.\n\nOutside the legendarium, Tolkien attempted to write his own versions of Scandinavian sagas such as ''[[The Story of Kullervo]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun]]''. The influence and themes of these stories can be seen in Tolkien's tales of ill-fated heroes such as [[Túrin]] and in the conflicts of his heroes against cunning and powerful [[Dragons]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Old Norse]]\n*[[Elves#Germanic influence]]\n*[[Hrólfs saga kraka]]\n*[[Poetic Edda]]\n[[Category:Mythology]]"}}}
