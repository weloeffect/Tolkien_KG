Tolkien]], originally published in [[1953]], in volume 6 of the scholarly journal ''Essays and Studies by Members of the English Association''. It is now most available in the latest edition of ''[[Tree and Leaf]]''.\n\nIt is a work of historical fiction, inspired by the [[Old English]] poem ''[[wikipedia:The Battle of Maldon|The Battle of Maldon]]''. It is written in the form of an alliterative poem, but is also a play, being mainly a dialogue between two characters in the aftermath of the Battle of Maldon. The work was accompanied by two essays, also by Tolkien, one before and one after the main work. The work, as published, was thus presented as:\n\n* \"The Death of Beorhtnoth\" — an introductory essay concerning the battle and the Old English fragment that inspired Tolkien.\n* \"''The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm's Son''\" — the actual work itself.\n* \"[[Ofermod]]\" — an essay following on from the main work, discussing the meaning of the Old English word ''[[ofermod]]''.\n\nThe poem is a notable yet obscure work of Tolkien's, demonstrating his ability to recreate the alliterative beauty of Old English, yet at the same time deviating from the style in decidedly modern ways.\n\nExtracts from unpublished drafts of ''The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth'' were published in [[Tolkien Studies: Volume 4|''Tolkien Studies'', Volume 4]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe play itself is the story of two characters, Tidwald (Tida) and Torhthelm (Totta), retrieving the body of Beorhtnoth, Ealdorman of Essex, from the battlefield at Maldon. After a brief search they eventually find their lord's battle-mangled body and his golden sword. In the middle of the action, Totta slays an English battlefield-looter, for which Tída chastises him.\n\nThe murder provides an opportunity for the characters to discuss the ethics of Beorhtnoth's actions. Totta is a romantic who thinks Beorhtnoth's actions were tragically noble, while Tída is the battle-experienced farmer who takes the realist position, pointing out the folly of Beorhtnoth's decision to let the Vikings cross the causeway. Eventually the two characters load the lord's body onto a cart, and the drama closes with them leaving the battlefield for a nearby abbey in Ely.\n\n==Publication history==\n*[[1953]]: ''[[Essays and Studies 1953]]''\n*[[1966]]: '''''[[The Tolkien Reader]]'''''\n*[[1975]]: ''[[Tree and Leaf; Smith of Wootton Major; The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth]]''\n*[[1980]]: '''''[[Poems and Stories]]'''''\n*[[1991]]: ''[[The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth (booklet)]]''\n*[[2001]]: '''''[[Tree and Leaf]]'''''\n*[[2023]]: [[The Battle of Maldon|'''''The Battle of Maldon''': together with The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth'']]\n\nThere is a recording of the poem read by Tolkien, though never formally released, some copies were distributed as cassettes to the participants of [[J.R.R.

However, Tolkien was of the opinion that these texts were \"''very germane to the general division of sympathy exhibited in'' [[The Lord of the Rings]]\".<ref>{{CG|RG}}, p. 1024, cite from [[Letter to Rayner Unwin (25 April 1966)]]</ref>\n\n==External links==\n*[https://soundcloud.com/harpercollinspublishers/the-homecoming-of-beorhtnoth Fragment of the audio recording by J.R.R.
