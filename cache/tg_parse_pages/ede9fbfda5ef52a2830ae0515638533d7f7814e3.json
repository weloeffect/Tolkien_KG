This '[[Battle of Isengard|Last March of the Ents]]' was a significant event in the [[War of the Ring]].<ref name=\"Treebeard\"/>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''\n:Unlike in the book, the Entmoot in the film concludes with the Ents refusing to take action against Isengard. The Ents are apparently unaware of the extent of the devastation wrought by Saruman at the time, and it is only later-after Treebeard has walked to within sight of Isengard-that the moot is summoned to war.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Ents]]\n[[Category:Organizations]]\n\n[[de:Entthing]]\n[[fr:encyclo:personnages:ents:chambre des ents]]\n[[fi:Entkäräjät]]"}}}
