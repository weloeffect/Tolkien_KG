It appears in their sixth full-lenght album, [[Oath Bound]].\n==Lyrics==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nThe wind is cold and heavy \nAnd storms are in the sky \nOur path across the nordland \nGoes higher and more high \n\nTo left the sea we came from \nTo right the white hills with no tree \nThe wind is growing colder \nAnd shivering are we \n\nWe drag with stiffening fingers \nOur swords and up the hill \nThe path is steep and tangled \nBut leads to battles still \n\nDor firn i guinar. \n\n\nFarewell now mountain vale and plain \nFarewell now wind and frost and rain \nAnd mist and cloud and heavens air \nYe star and moon so blinding fair \n\nFarewell now blade and bloom and grass \nThat see the changing season pass \nFarewell sweet earth and northern sky \nForever blessed but here we die \n\nDor firn i guinar.\n\n</poem>\n[[Category:Songs by Summoning]]"}}}
