It appears in their second full-length album, [[Sword's Song]], released in [[2003]].\n==Lyrics==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nFinally free form the chains of the ages \nThe terror of ancient times \nDisregard the divine sentence \nWill of Valar disobeyed \n\nSilent caverns, great kingdom of stone \nLong ago, fulfilled with life \nSo many ages for the honoured Mahal \nNow defiled by Morgoth's tribe \n\nShadowed flames shall breath again \nThe fire of vengeance, the death infernal \n\nToo greedy and weak, too deep they are heading \nAule's people the folk of the stone \nReaching something, the forgotten keep \nChamber of the cursed demon \nCall of Mithil charmed their hammers \nThe vain of silver turned red by blood \nThe hidden prison beneath the earth \nTheir doom, Great Balrog released \nDwarven warhearts fought with their fury \nAgainst this creature of hate \nTwo dead kings and thousands of men \nSlain by the fiery blade \n\nSoon it's over, alle the dwarfs defeated \nThe silence of the carverns stand still \nOrcs took the command of the caves and depths \nThe darklord has reached his will \n\nCenturies went by and Sauron made a mistake \nHe murder of Thor, dwarven king \nThe revenge they swear, there's no other way \nLet the storms of war rise again \nThe demon rages in the dungeons of Moria \nSill a few went back to those caves \nThey didn't survive, orcs breed again \nHiding from the light of the day \n\nAll was silent under the stone \nUntil he heroes arrived \nDemon was slain by the wizard of grey \nMithrandir one of the Maiar \n\nThe last battle was fought \nThere were kingdoms no more \nNo heirs to demand their throne \nOne great halls by the children of Aule \nSill standing and never shall fall\n</poem>\n[[Category:Songs by Battlelore]]"}}}
