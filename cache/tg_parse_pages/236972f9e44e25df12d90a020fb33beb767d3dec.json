The [[Great Plague]] three hundred years previously had killed most of the people of [[Cardolan]], which later fell to the Witch-king. Even with the aid of [[Elves]] and [[Hobbits]], most of the diminished and totally demoralized people of Arnor were waiting to make their final stand at Fornost, capital city of [[Arthedain]].<ref name=\":0\">{{App|A1iii}}</ref>\n\n===Opposing Forces===\n\nFor the forces of [[Eriador]], exact numbers are not known. It can be estimated that, at most, ten thousand [[Men of Arnor]] were present at the city, along with possibly several thousand Elves of [[Lindon]], [[Rivendell]], [[Lothlórien]], and five hundred Hobbits archers from [[the Shire]].\n\nThe forces of [[Angmar]] can be estimated as between forty and sixty thousand [[Orcs]], [[Trolls]], Evil Men, Wolves, and all other manner of evil creatures.<!-- Source? - MOON -->\n\n===The Battle===\n\nNot much is known of the battle, and it is simply stated that the Witch-king overran Fornost and the King was driven into the [[North Downs]]. The Witch-king's forces occupied Fornost and pillaged it.\n\n===Aftermath===\n\nWith Arthedain in his hands, the Witch-king had conquered all of Arnor. [[Arvedui]] perished in the [[Icebay of Forochel]] when a ship sent to rescue him sank in a storm. The Witch-king took the throne in the king's palace, until a year later in {{TA|1975}} when the forces of [[Eriador]] had regrouped with newly arrived reinforcements from [[Gondor]]. In the [[Battle of Fornost]], his army was destroyed, and he himself fled east over the [[Misty Mountains]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFornost was not resettled after the war. It became a deserted place, feared by the men of [[Bree]], who called it Deadmen's Dike.  It was not until a thousand years later after the [[War of the Ring]] under King [[Aragorn|Elessar]] was it refounded.<ref>[[J.R.R.
