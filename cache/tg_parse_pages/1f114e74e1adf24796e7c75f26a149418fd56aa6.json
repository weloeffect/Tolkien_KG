Their iron was expertly linked, so that they could coil and crawl like slow rivers over difficult terrain. Within these devices were Orcs armed with scimitars and spears, ready to emerge at need. It is said that after their appearance at Gondolin, such devices would not be seen again until the [[Dagor Dagorath|Great End]].<ref name=Fall/>{{rp|170}}\n\n==Inspiration==\nWhile many of Tolkien's works echo the conflicts of [[World War I]], ''The Fall of Gondolin'' is particularly striking in the descriptions of the 'monsters' Melko has built in his preparation for the battle. According to [[John Garth]], the narrative of the battle \"appears to echo Tolkien's creative development and slow acceptance of duty in the first year of [[World War I|the war]]\" whereas the latter part echoes his personal experience of battle. The creatures of iron and bronze which are capable of crossing difficult terrain and which contain within them companies of orcs, could resemble tanks that made their debut in the Battle of the Somme.<ref>[[John Garth]], ''[[Tolkien and the Great War]]: The Threshold of Middle-earth'', \"11. Castles in the air\", p. 217</ref> In the commentary to the text, [[Christopher Tolkien]] seems to support this view saying that \"the language employed suggests that some at least of the 'Monsters' were inanimate 'devices',\" although he also points out they are also referred as 'beasts'.<ref name=Commentary />\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Servants of Melkor]]"}}}
