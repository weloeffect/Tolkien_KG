The first, 1957 translation by [[Walter Scherf]], ''Kleiner Hobbit und der grosse Zauberer'' (\"The Little Hobbit and the Great Wizard\"), abbrievated to ''Der kleine Hobbit'' (\"The Little Hobbit\") since its second edition in 1967, and the second, 1997 translation by [[Wolfgang Krege]], ''Der Hobbit oder Hin und zurück'' (\"The Hobbit or There and Back\"). \n\nDue to the era the ''Der Hobbit'' radio series was produced in, it used the terminology and some of the excerpts from the earlier translation by Scherf. The title of the radio series was also originally ''Der kleine Hobbit'', for the sake of consistency with the then-in-use title of the first translation. The published editions of this adaptation from more recent decades have simplified the title to just ''Der Hobbit''. This is the title that the radio series can be found under these days, for anyone looking to purchase a physical medium or digital copy of it.<ref>[http://www.elrondslibrary.fr/T_German.html Elrond's Library.fr - Published German translations of Tolkien's works] (not entirely up to date).
