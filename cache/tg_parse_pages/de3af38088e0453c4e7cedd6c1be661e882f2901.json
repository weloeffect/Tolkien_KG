The inscription in Book XI reads:\n\n:\"''In this book are recorded the last writings of John Ronald Reuel Tolkien concerning the [[Battles of Beleriand|wars of Beleriand]], here also is told the story of how Húrin Thali[o]n brought ruin to the Men of Brethil, with much else concerning the Edain and Dwarves and the names of many peoples in the [[Elvish|speech of the Elves]].''\"\n\n==From the publisher==\n{{blockquote|The second of two companion volumes which documents the later writing of The Silmarillion, Tolkien’s epic tale of war.<br>\nIn The War of the Jewels Christopher Tolkien takes up his account of the later history of The Silmarillion from the point where it was left in Morgoth’s Ring. The story now returns to Middle-earth, and the ruinous conflict of the High Elves and the Men who were their allies with the power of the Dark Lord. With the publication in this book of all J.R.R. Tolkien’s later narrative writing concerned with the last centuries of the First Age, the long history of The Silmarillion, from its beginning in The Book of Lost Tales, is completed; and the enigmatic state of the work at his death can be understood.<br>\nThis book contains the full text of [[The Grey Annals]], the primary record of The War of the Jewels, and a major story of Middle-earth now published for the first time: the tale of the disaster that overtook the forest people of Brethil when Hurin the Steadfast came among them after his release from long years of captivity in Angband, the fortress of Morgoth.}}\n\n==Publication history and gallery==\n;UK editions\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"125px\" heights=\"125px\">\nFile:War of the Jewels 1994.png |1994 hardcover\nFile:War of the Jewels 1995.jpeg |1995 paperback\nFile:The War of the Jewels (HC2002).jpeg |2002 & 2015 paperback\nFile:War of the Jewels 2010.png ‎|2010 hardcover\nFile:War of the Jewels 2024.jpeg ‎|2024 paperback\nFile:War of the Jewels hc 2024.jpg|2024 hardcover\n</gallery>\n* [[HarperCollins]] hardcover ([[1994]]), pp.&nbsp;470.
