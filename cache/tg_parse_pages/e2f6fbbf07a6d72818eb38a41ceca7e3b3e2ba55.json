A sequel, ''[[The Lord of the Rings, Vol. II: The Two Towers]]'', was released in [[1993]]. Interplay also released a [[J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I (SNES)|version for the SNES]], which greatly differed from the PC game.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\nThe CD-rom version of the game opens with some cut scenes from [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', while the floppy disk version of the game uses simple animated cut-scenes to tell the story. The player starts as [[Frodo Baggins]] at [[Bag End]] and must first travel to [[Buckland]] before crossing the [[Old Forest]] and the [[Barrow-downs]] to get to [[Bree]]. In the Barrow-downs the player must escape the [[Barrow-wights]] with the help of [[Tom Bombadil]]. Whilst at [[Rivendell]] you must collect the cloaks of the Nazgûl that were defeated at the Ford of Bruinen, as well as the pieces of [[Andúril]], both of which can be found in the surrounding lands.<ref name=\"Tolkien Games\"/>\n\nAfter the player escapes the darkness of [[Moria]] they must search the gifts from [[Galadriel]]. When Frodo Baggins is captured in [[Dol Guldur]] the remaining members of the Fellowship must then free Frodo with help from [[Radagast|Radagast the Brown]] and the [[Elves]] of [[Lothlórien]] before the [[Witch-king]] arrives and brings the [[Ring-bearer]] to [[Mordor]] and the fate of [[Middle-earth]] is lost.<ref name=\"Tolkien Games\"/>\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\n===PC version===\n\nThe player starts as [[Frodo Baggins]] and can immediately recruit [[Sam Gamgee]] and [[Peregrin Took]]. Through the course of the game, the other six members of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] can be recruited. The player can switch between characters to decide who leads the Fellowship, equip other party members with a range of weapons and armour, distribute skills among the group, cast spells, and perform various skill-based actions.<ref name=\"Tolkien Games\"/> Whilst progressing through the main story, the player is able to complete several side adventures and revisit previous locations, during which new characters, quests and objects can be discovered.<ref name=\"Tolkien Games\"/><ref name=\"Polygon\"/> The game also included a day/night system. At night, some enemies are stronger and there is a greater chance of encountering the [[Nazgûl]] than during day-time.<ref name=\"Tolkien Games\"/>\n\n=== SNES version ===\n\nThe player starts as [[Frodo Baggins]] and can obtain the rest of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] (except [[Boromir]]) as they progress through the main story.\n\n== Characters ==\n\nThere are thirty-seven playable characters in total in the PC version of the game, some of them only available temporarily. Some characters, such as [[Elladan]], [[Elrohir]], and [[Glorfindel]], can be recruited and taken through to the end-game, if desired.\n\n=== Playable characters ===\n[[Image:Lotr1 2-1-.gif|thumb|300px]]\n* [[Frodo Baggins]]\n* [[Samwise Gamgee]]\n* [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]]\n* [[Peregrin Took]]\n* [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]]\n* [[Gandalf|Gandalf the Grey]]\n* [[Legolas]]\n* [[Boromir]]\n* [[Gimli]]\n\n==Temporary characters==\n* [[Tom Bombadil]]<ref name=\"Polygon\"/>\n\n==Development==\n\nInterplay started developing a fantasy RPG, which was not set in Middle-earth, in the late 1980s. After Interplay obtained the license for creating a video game based on The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, the game was scrapped and redeveloped as an adaptation of [[The Fellowship of the Ring]].<ref name=\"Polygon\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[:Category:Images from The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I (PC)|Image gallery]]\n* ''[[J.R.R.
