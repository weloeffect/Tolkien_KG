The thematic axis of the papers is, therefore, Lewis's best-known work of fiction, The Chronicles of Narnia, either as a whole or as a selection of individual volumes and/or episodes set in the World Beyond the Wardrobe, always, however, in connection with Tolkien's own (sub)creative projects. The papers themselves deal with such diverse fields of academic research as literature, theology, philosophy etc. }}\n\n==External links==\n\n* [http://www.walking-tree.org/books/songs_of_the_spheres.php Official product page]\n\n{{Cormarë}}\n{{title|italics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Songs of the Spheres}}\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]"}}}
