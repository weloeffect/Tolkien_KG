This scene was extended in the latter edition.\n{{title}}\n==Synopsis==\nAt night during the journey from [[Edoras]] to [[Helm's Deep]], [[Aragorn]] sits smoking his pipe, deep in thought. The scene transitions to a flashback of Aragorn laying on a bed in [[Rivendell]]. Seeing Arwen sitting above him, he proclaims the scene a dream. Smiling, Arwen replies it must be a good dream and bends down as they share a deep kiss. After separating, they gaze into each other's eyes, Arwen tells him to sleep, kisses him again, and gets up from the bed to watch the sunset. Aragorn, however, cannot sleep and instead tells her \"You told me once that this day would come.\" In response, she tells him that his path is to go with [[Frodo]]. As they stand together, he expresses his uncertainty. She touches the [[Elfstone|evenstar]] hanging around his neck, and comforts him in his doubt. \n{{blockquote|Ae ú-esteliach nad... estelio han. Estelio ammen. <br /> (If you trust nothing else... trust this. Trust us.)|[[Arwen]] to [[Aragorn]]}}\nAragorn takes her hand and they kiss each other. \n\nThe flashback ends and Aragorn is walking through [[Rohan]] with [[Éowyn]], the evenstar hanging around his neck. Éowyn asks him of the woman who gave him the jewel. \n\nAragorn recalls speaking with [[Elrond]] before setting out from Rivendell with the [[Fellowship of the Ring]]. Elrond beseeches him to let Arwen go to Valinor where her love for him will endure forever. Aragorn points out that it will only be a memory there. Elrond sternly tells Aragorn that he will not let his daughter [[Gift of Men|die]]. Aragorn takes leave of Elrond and prepares to join the Fellowship. Arwen emerges from a side path and asks why he is trying to leave unnoticed. He tells her that he will not be coming back.\n{{blockquote|Idhren emmen menna gui ethwel. Hae o auth...a nîr...a naeth. <br /> (You have a chance for another life. Away from war...grief...despair.) <br /><br /> I am mortal. You are Elf-kind.|[[Aragorn]] to [[Arwen]]}}\nHe tells her their love was nothing more than a dream and tries to return the evenstar to her. She says she does not believe him and staunchly bids him keep the jewel, saying that it was a gift. \n\nThe flashback ends and Éowyn breaks Aragorn away from his memory. He answers her earlier question by telling her that the woman who gave him the jewel is sailing to [[Valinor]] with [[Elves|her kin]]. \n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers scenes|33]]"}}}
