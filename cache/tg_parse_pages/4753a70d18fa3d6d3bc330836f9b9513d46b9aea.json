Between these two peaks was the island hill of [[Tol Brandir]].<ref name=greatriver/>\n\nAmon Lhaw may possibly have been a little \"over 1,000 feet\" according to a [[1959]] letter that [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote to a reader about the height of Amon Hen.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, entry \"the summit of Amon Hen\", p. 350. From Waterfield's Catalogue 157, ''Modern Literature'', 1995, item 427.</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAmon Lhaw was first fortified \"in the days of the great kings\" according to [[Aragorn]], though the precise dating is unspecified.<ref name=greatriver/> The hill was fortified before the time of the [[Stewards of Gondor|Stewards]], which meant that by the year {{TA|3019}}, the fortifications were at a minimum 969 years old. One likely possibility is that the hill was fortified at the same time as the [[Argonath]], which was built after [[Rómendacil II|Minalcar]] defeated the [[Easterlings]] in the year {{TA|1248}} but before the end of his reign in the year {{TA|1366}}.<ref>{{App|A}}</ref>\n\nAt one time Amon Lhaw had been part of the [[North March]]<ref>{{TT|Window}}</ref> of [[Gondor]] and a high seat<ref name=breaking>{{FR|II10}}</ref> was built there upon which [[Men]] kept watch. By the time of the [[War of the Ring]] however, it had long since fallen under the influence of [[Mordor]], as spies often roamed there. Such spies may have been [[Orcs]].<ref name=greatriver/>\n\nIn the year 3019, following the [[Breaking of the Fellowship]] at [[Parth Galen]], [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]] took a boat and paddled across [[Nen Hithoel]]. They landed upon the southern slopes of Amon Lhaw where there was a shelving shore.<ref name=breaking/>\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Amon Lhaw'' is [[Sindarin]], and translates as \"Hill of Hearing\", or \"Hill of Ears\",<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3220373299.html|articlename=S.

He also originally gave Amon Lhaw the [[Quenya]] name '''''Larmindon''''' (\"Listen Tower\")<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3103547467.html|articlename=ᴹQ. Larmindon loc.|dated=|website=Eldamo|accessed=}}</ref>.<ref>{{TI|River}}, p. 364</ref>\n\nAt the top of a draft entitled \"Trotter on Amon Hen\", Tolkien wrote \"many experimental [[Elvish]] names\" such as '''''Llawhen''''', '''''Amon Tirlaw''''', '''''Lhawdir''''', '''''Lasthen''''', '''''Henlas''''', and '''''Hendlas'''''.
