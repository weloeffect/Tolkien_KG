Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien''''' is the third book of Walking Tree's ''[[Cormarë Series]]''. Unlike most other volumes, it is not a collection of essays, but a single work by [[Richard Sturch]]. \n\n==From the publisher==\n{{blockquote|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', it has long been recognized, was shaped and undergirded by his Christian beliefs. But he was not the only writer of fantasy to have a close relationship between his faith and his fiction. This book is a study of such relationships in four writers: Tolkien himself, his friends [[C.S. Lewis]] and [[Charles Williams]], and, from an earlier generation, George MacDonald. It seeks to look at their use of other worlds and other beings; at their attitudes towards 'escapism'; at the presence of symbolism and myth in their writings; at the themes and ideas they had in common; and at the extent to which their fiction has a value for Christian apologetics.}}\n\n==Contents==\n*Chapter 1 - Introduction: On Christian Fantasists\n*Chapter 2 - Other Worlds and Other Beings\n*Chapter 3 - The Charge of Escapism\n*Chapter 4 - Varieties of Symbolism\n*Chapter 5 - Themes\n*Chapter 6 - Apologetics\n*Appendix - Three Unbaptized Imaginations\n*Bibliography\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.walking-tree.org/cormareBookInfo.php?number=3 Official product page]\n* [http://www.walking-tree.org/press/2001_amhen170.html Review by Neil Mercer], originally published in [[Amon Hen 170|''Amon Hen'' 170]]\n{{Cormarë}}\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Religious books]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]"}}}
