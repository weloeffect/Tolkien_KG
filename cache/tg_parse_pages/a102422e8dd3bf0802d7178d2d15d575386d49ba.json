In the Second Age some of these Nandor were nomadic \"wandering companies\", and they acknowledged [[Celeborn]] and [[Galadriel]] as \"[[Lord and Lady]] of the Eldar in Eriador\", ruling from [[Nenuial]].<ref>{{UT|Concerning}}, p. 302</ref>\n\nIn later ages wandering companies set out from [[Rivendell]] to various destinations, such as the [[Tower Hills]].<ref>{{HM|RC}}</ref> \n\nThe [[Hobbits]] had contact with [[Elves]] around Eriador, and the [[Fallohides]] were friendlier to them than other Hobbits. Along with [[Dwarves]], they were a source of news from the outside world. It is possible that the [[Shire-hobbits]] learned the art of building directly from them. However as time passed in [[the Shire]], they had less contact with the Elves, growing some fear about them, and distrust for those that had dealings with them, coupled with their fear of the [[Sea]].<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>\n\n[[Bilbo Baggins]], and later [[Frodo Baggins]] were often wandering far from home, in the hills and woods at night, and they were suspected meeting Elves who seldom walked in the Shire.<ref name=shadow/> Indeed some Elves like [[Gildor Inglorion]] had seen them many times while journeying, although the hobbits did not notice them.<ref name=three/> In the years leading to the [[War of the Ring]], some [[Elves of Lindon]] traversed the Shire in [[Spring]] and [[Autumn]],<ref name=three/> while others passed on their way to the [[Grey Havens]], leaving [[Middle-earth]].<ref name=shadow>{{FR|Shadow}}</ref>\n\nOne such Wandering Company, led by [[Gildor|Gildor Inglorion]], having gazed in the ''[[Elendil's Stone|Palantír]]'' of the [[White Towers]], seeking a glimpse of [[Varda|Elbereth]], were returning to [[Rivendell]]. On [[24 September]] {{TA|3018}}, their chants drove away a [[Ringwraith]], and soon were encountered by Frodo, [[Samwise Gamgee]] and [[Peregrin Took]].\n\nGildor promised to inform other Wandering Companies of Frodo's journey, so that those who could, should help him.<ref name=three>{{FR|Three}}</ref>\n\n==Customs==\nDuring their wandering the Elves were silent and could move unseen, and seldom took other travellers with them.\n\nAt nights they camped in places around Eriador. One such place was a hill in [[Woody End]], above [[Woodhall]] (eighteen miles west of the [[Bucklebury Ferry]]<ref name=short>{{FR|I4}}</ref>); a greensward and a natural opening like a \"hall\" formed by the trees as pillars. They sang watching the stars rising, especially [[Menelvagor]], which was a sign for merriment. Then they lit a wood-fire, and torches with lights of gold and silver set upon the trees, and feasted sitting on the grass or old sawn trunks. They shared cool gold-coloured and fragrant draughts; and dishes heaped with food, more than a hobbit's birthday feast (although just a small fare compared to how they treated guests in their halls), and fruits sweeter and richer than those of the Shire gardens.<ref name=three/> They rested on fragrant beds made of fern and grass, set on bowers made by laced tree-branches.<ref name=short/>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring - Elves leaving Middle-earth.jpg|thumb|Elves leaving Middle-earth in {{fotree}}]]\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':''' \n:A scene that was shot on the third day of principal photography, \"[[The Passing of the Elves]]\", is a reference to this passage in the book although no interaction is made between the hobbits and the Elves.
