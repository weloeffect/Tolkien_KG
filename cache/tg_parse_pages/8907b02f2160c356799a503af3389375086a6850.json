Tolkien]], to be sung to the tune of ''Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star''. It is published as the 14th song in ''[[Songs for the Philologists]]'' in [[1936]].\n\nThe song is reprinted with Modern English translation \"Good Luck to You\" in ''[[The Road to Middle-earth]]'' by [[T.A. Shippey]]. Corrections made by Tolkien himself (after the printing of the ''Songs'') are noted below.\n\n==The song==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\n'''Éadig Béo Þu'''\n\nÉadig béo þu, góda mann!\nÉadig béo þu, léofe wif!\nLangre lisse ic þe ann —\nhafa lof and líke líf!\nHé þe hér swa sáre swanc,\nrúna rǽdde' and fyrngewrit,\nhál beo hé, on sálum wlanc,\nhalde láre' and wís gewit!\n\nÉadig béo we eft swa nú!\nDréam ne dréose, drync genóg\nflówe on fullum síb swa iú —\nfyllaþ wǽge, fyllaþ cróg!\nByrla!

I give you lasting joy, have praise and pleasant life. He who worked you here so hard, expounded runes and ancient texts, may he be happy too, merry at his feasts, and keep up good sense and learning.\n\nMay we be happy later as we are now, may joy not fail, and drink enough flow in the cups in times to come as times gone by — fill the cups and fill the pitchers! Waiter, waiter, give us mead! Doom is far though doom be strong, give up work and pour us drink. <ref group=note>There are three versions of the 5th and 7th lines of this stanza. The first (as printed in the ''Songs'') is ''Byrla! byrla! medu briht ... Swinc tomorgen, drinc toniht!'', or ‘Waiter! waiter! bright mead ... work tomorrow, drink tonight!’. Tolkien rejected this because ‘''briht'' is not an OE form’. The second is ''Byrla medu! Byrla wín! ... Scenc nu his and scenc nu mín'', or ‘Serve mead! Serve wine! ... Now give him his and give me mine’. The third and last is given above.</ref> Joy is little and labour long.\n\nLet's sing a cheerful song, praise the Birch and birch's race, the teacher, the student and the subject, may we all have health and joy and happiness. The oak will fall into the fire, losing joy and leaf and life. The birch shall keep its glory long, shine in splendour over the bright plain. \n</poem>\n\n{{notes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Eadig Beo Þu}}\n[[Category:Poems and songs in Songs for the Philologists]]"}}}
