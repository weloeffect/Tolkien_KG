Gordon]]. It was first published in [[1960]]. \n\nInitially, ''The Seafarer'', along with another Old English poem ''[[wikipedia:The Wanderer (Old English poem)|The Wanderer]]'', were collaborative works of [[E.V. Gordon]] and [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. They were left unfinished when the former died in [[1938]]. Gordon's wife [[I.L. Gordon|Ida]] later continued to work on one of them and, due the large revision, published it under her own name in [[1960]].\n\nIn the preface is noted that it \"incorporates much of the original material, especially in the Notes\", and that she \"wish to thank Professor Tolkien for some notes given to me with his usual generosity.\"\n\nIn [[1996]], a new edition appeared, which includes a 16-page Bibliography compiled by Mary Clayton.\n\n\n==Publication history and gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"125px\" heights=\"125px\">\nFile:The Seafarer 1960.jpeg|1960 first edition\nFile:The Seafarer 1979.jpeg|1979 edition\nFile:The Seafarer 1996.jpg|1996 edition\n</gallery>\n* Methuen, hardcover ([[1960]]), pp.&nbsp;80\n* Manchester University Press, paperback ([[1979]]), ISBN 071900778X\n* Liverpool University Press, paperback ([[1996]]), pp.&nbsp;96.
