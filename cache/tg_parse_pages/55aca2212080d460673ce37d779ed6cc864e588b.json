Tolkien]]. Several versions of the poem exist, the earliest dating from November [[1915]], entitled '''''Kortirion among the Trees'''''.<ref>{{L|3}}</ref> In [[1937]], Tolkien undertook a major revision of the poem. The final version appears to have been composed \"nearly half a century after\" 1915.<ref>{{LT1|In}}, pp. 32-43</ref>\n\nTolkien considered refurbishing the poem to be included in ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'' but it was too long and ambitious and stood different from the others. It was omitted along with ''[[The Dragon's Visit]]'', and replaced by three poems from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref>{{AB|Intro}}</ref>\n\nThree different versions of the poem were published in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]'': a pre-1937 version, the 1937 revision, and the final version.\n\n==Fragment (last version)==\nI.
