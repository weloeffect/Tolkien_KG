Tolkien - My house (Christmas House).png|thumb|The Christmas House, drawn by Father Christmas]]\nThe '''Christmas House''' was [[Father Christmas]]'s house up until its destruction in [[1925]].\n==Description==\nThe house was circular with a domed top.<ref>{{LFC|1920}}, illustration</ref><ref>{{LFC|1925}}, illustration</ref> The [[North Pole]] sat atop the house.<ref name=l25>{{LFC|1925}}</ref> The house had a cellar which was used to store, among other things, fireworks.<ref>{{LFC|1926}}</ref>\n==History==\nIn November [[1925]], a gust of wind blew Father Christmas's hood off and it landed on the top of the North Pole. Despite's Father Christmas's protests, the [[North Polar Bear]] went onto the roof to try to retrieve it. While attempting to climb the North Pole, it cracked in half and the North Polar Bear fell, creating a hole in the dining room ceiling. After this Father Christmas moved into the [[Cliff House]].<ref name=l25/>\n\nAfter several days of finding items in the cellar of the Cliff House missing and in disarray, Father Christmas and the North Polar Bear discovered a tunnel which they were too small to fit through. After going to the caves to confer with [[Mr Cave Bear]], they discovered a tunnel built by [[Orcs#Other writings|Goblins]], leading from the caves to the Christmas House that had been built long before and had been used by the Goblins to steal many items from Father Christmas. After strong snow-storms the Christmas House was completely buried.<ref>{{LFC|1932b}}</ref>\n{{WLFC}}\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Letters from Father Christmas]]"}}}
