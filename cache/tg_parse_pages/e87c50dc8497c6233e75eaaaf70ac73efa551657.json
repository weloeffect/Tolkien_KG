It was extended in the latter edition.\n\n==Synopsis==\nAfter dark, [[Pippin]] rummages through the weapons he has received from putting himself in the service of the [[Steward]]. He says with hope that he doubts he will be expected to fight, but a somewhat annoyed [[Gandalf]] tells him he will have to do as he is told now. Pippin tells Gandalf of his anxiety about waiting for battle and asks him if there was ever any hope for [[Frodo]] and [[Sam]] to complete their quest. Gandalf smiles at him and says \"Just a fool's hope\". \n\nAs the wizard and hobbit gaze towards [[Mordor]], Gandalf describes the armies that will attack [[Gondor]]. Seeking the positives, Pippin says \"We have the White Wizard. That's got to count for something\". Gandalf remains silent for a moment before telling him that [[Sauron]] has not yet revealed his most deadly servant: the [[Witch-king of Angmar]], who Pippin knows as the [[Nazgûl]] that stabbed Frodo on [[Weathertop]].  \n\n==Differences==\nIn the book, some of the themes touched on in this scene occur during Pippin's discussion with [[Beregond]] which occurs after Gandalf's audience with [[Denethor]]. Pippin voices his anxieties regarding waiting for battle to Beregond who describes the \"slowing of activity\" Pippin has experienced in the city as ''the deep breath before the plunge''. In the book, it is Beregond rather than Gandalf who tells Pippin that it is in Gondor where \"the hammer-stroke will fall the hardest\".<ref>{{RK|MT}}, pp. 765-6</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King scenes|14]]"}}}
