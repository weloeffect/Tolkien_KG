[[1968]].\n\n==History==\nAs a good philologist, Tolkien enjoyed word-games, and he played many times with his family while he stayed in [[Bournemouth]].<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Simon Tolkien]]|articleurl=http://www.simontolkien.com/mygrandfather|articlename=My Grandfather|dated=2003|website=[http://www.simontolkien.com/ simontolkien.com]|accessed=15 January 2020}}</ref> One of the games he invented there was written on the reverse of a cyclostyled list of out-of-print books dated [[3 May]] 1968, which Tolkien gave at some point to Dr. Denis Tolhurst (Tolkien's doctor at Bournemouth) and his wife. The manuscript was sold at Bonhams in [[2019]],<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/25355/lot/253/|articlename=Auction 25355, Lot 253|dated=26 Jun 2019|website=[http://www.bonhams.com/ Bonhams]|accessed=15 January 2020}}</ref> and is currently on sale at Lucius Books.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.luciusbooks.com/shop/signed-inscribed/autograph-manuscript-word-extraction/|articlename=Autograph manuscript \"Word extraction\"|dated=|website=[http://www.luciusbooks.com/ Lucius Books]|accessed=15 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Text==\n{{blockquote|<center>'''Word-extraction'''</center><br />\n1. A 'base-word' is chosen; competitors then extract from it lists of as many shorter words as they can find. Each separate word scores 1 point.<br />\n\n2. The extracted words must be recognized modern English generally understood or used by literate people.<br />\n\n3. They must be made only of letters found in the 'base-word' and may not use any letter more often than it occurs there.<br />\n\n4. The whole 'base-word' is not counted, but any unchanged part of it that is an English word can be counted: e.g. from '''extraction''' one may take '''tract''', '''traction''', '''extract''' and score 1 point for each.<br />\n\n5. A '''anagram''' of the 'base-word', however, scores 1 point and in addition is given and extra mark, or marks, according to its length. See note.<br />\n\n6. Only '''spelling''' is concerned. Thus (a) two or more words of identical spelling score 1 point, even if they differ in meaning, and as sometimes happens also in pronunciation; but (b) if a word has more than one recognized spelling, each spelling scores 1 point. For example: '''ash''' (tree) and '''ash''' (residue of burning) together score only 1 point; similarly '''éntrance''' n. and '''entránce''' v. But '''grey''' and '''gray''' score 1 point each.<br />\n\n7. A dictionary may '''not''' be used in compiling lists in competition; but a dictionary may be used in marking the lists, if any competitor disputs the spelling of a word, or its right to be recognized as 'modern English'.}}\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Languages (real-world)]]\n[[Category:Manuscripts by J.R.R.
