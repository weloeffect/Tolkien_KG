He and his companions are described as wearing grey hooded cloaks and living on ''[[Telain|flets]]'' in the trees. \n\nHaldir was accompanied by his brothers between [[15 January|15]] and [[16 January]], {{TA|3019}}<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> when they encountered the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] who arrived in Lórien. His brothers interacted little with the Fellowship because they spoke little of the Common Speech. He treated [[Gimli]] rather poorly due to bad relations between Elves and Dwarves. He made him go blindfolded through the wood until [[Galadriel]] said he did not have to. \n\nHe had heard of [[Aragorn]], but there is no indication that they had met before.<ref name=\"LL\">{{FR|II6}}</ref> Haldir became their guide to the city of [[Caras Galadhon]]. \n\nAfter [[Celeborn]] and [[Galadriel]] had nourished their guests, and they were set to depart, Haldir led them to their Elven boats.<ref>{{FR|Farewell}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Haldir.mp3|Ardamir}}\n''Haldir'' is clearly [[Sindarin]], but it is never glossed.
