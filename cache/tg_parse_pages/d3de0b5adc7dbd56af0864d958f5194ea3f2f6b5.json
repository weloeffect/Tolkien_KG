In the rest of Middle-earth, they were known as [[Rohirrim]]. \n==Etymology==\n''Forgoil'' is the only known word in the language of the Dunlendings. It is possible that the final part of the word, ''-il'', is a plural marker, such as in the case of [[Westron]] ''il'' cf. ''[[mûmakil]]'' (which is perhaps [[Haradric]]); similar formation with the ending ''-li'' is also seen in [[Quenya]].<ref>[[Helge Fauskanger]], \"[http://www.uib.no/people/hnohf/mannish.htm Various Mannish Tongues]\", [[Ardalambion]]</ref> There is also a possibility of a plural formation with infixion from *''forgol''\n\nThe (possible) element ''go'' has been tied to the [[Pre-Númenórean]] word ''[[Go-hilleg]]'',<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', \"[[Tal-Elmar (chapter)|Tal-Elmar]]\"</ref> which is untranslated, but refers to the [[Númenóreans|Númenórean settlers]]. It could mean \"head\", in this sense.<ref>[[Roman Rausch]], \"[http://sindanoorie.atspace.com/Drughu.htm Tar-Elmar and the Drughu tongue]\", [http://sindanoorie.atspace.com/ Sindanórië] (accessed 18 January 2024) ([https://web.archive.org/web/20110716073849/http://sindanoorie.atspace.com/Drughu.htm archived: Wayback Machine])</ref> However, both these interpretations remain speculation; [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] never left any notes on the subject.\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Mannish words]]\n[[Category:Rohirrim]]\n[[de:Rohirrim#Beschreibung]]\n[[fi:Forgoil]]"}}}
