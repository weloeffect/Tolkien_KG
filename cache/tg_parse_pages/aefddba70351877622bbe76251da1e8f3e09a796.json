Golden flowers bloomed on the branches.<ref name=\"Lorien\"/>{{rp|335}}<ref name=\"Numenor\">{{UT|Numenor}}</ref> \n\nThe trunk of the tree divided to a crown of many branches, and the [[Galadhrim]] used the space to build ''[[telain]]'' (a sort of platform) or buildings on the top of the trees.<ref name=\"lor\" /> The leaves also had practical uses, such as for packing rations of ''[[lembas]]''.

The Elves of Tol Eressëa brought mallorn-trees to the [[Men]] of [[Númenor]] and they grew on the shores around the [[Bay of Eldanna]] in that land.<ref name=\"Numenor\" /> Even [[Tar-Aldarion]], the great Ship-King, did not cut down these trees.\n\nMallorn-nuts were given by Tar-Aldarion to his friend [[Gil-galad]], the Noldorin King of [[Lindon]].

The [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]] spent the night in a [[Telain|flet]] in a mallorn-tree nearby, and were later given [[lembas]] wrapped in mallorn-leaves.<ref name=\"lor\">{{FR|II7}}</ref>\n\nGaladriel gave [[Samwise Gamgee]] a box of soil containing a single silver mallorn nut.<ref>{{FR|II8}}</ref> After the [[War of the Ring]] and the [[Scouring of the Shire]], Sam planted the nut in the [[Party Field]] where the [[Party Tree]] had stood before its felling. The [[Golden Tree]] was the only mallorn in Middle-earth outside of Lórien. When the tree bloomed in the next summer it was said that all the Shire became golden from the flowers.<ref>{{RK|VI9}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word comes from ''[[malt]]'' (\"gold\") + ''[[orn]]'' (\"tree\").
