Hostetter]] compares the ''lopoldi'' to European rabbits, which came to northwestern Europe at a late date.</ref><ref>{{NM|P3xiii}}, note 1</ref> The lopoldi were voracious herbivores and multiplied easily quickly, so they were found in large numbers on [[Númenor]]. The Númenóreans did not view the lopoldi as food, leaving them to be the chief food source of [[Foxes]], which were viewed as the best natural way to keep the lopoldi population levels under control. As a result of the abundance of the lopoldi, foxes never hunted animals domesticated by the Númenóreans.<ref>{{NM|P3xiii}}, pp. 334-335</ref> The lopoldi most likely perished during the [[Downfall of Númenor]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Lopoldi'' was the plural [[Quenya]] word for \"Rabbits\".<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3617275365.html|articlename=Q.
