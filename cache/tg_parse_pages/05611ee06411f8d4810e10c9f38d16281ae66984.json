At the bidding of [[Melian]], she watched over [[Túrin]] whenever he strayed into the woods during his boyhood years. Sometimes they played together or wandered hand in hand. To Túrin, she seemed no more than his own age.<ref name=Doriath/>\n\nIt was from Nellas' teachings that Túrin learned [[Doriathrin]], a more archaic and courteous form of [[Sindarin]], as well as the \"ways and the wild things of Doriath\".<ref name=Doriath/>\n\nEventually however, as Túrin grew to manhood, he turned his attention to warfare, and as Nellas was unwilling to venture under the roofs of stone of [[Menegroth]], Túrin eventually stopped meeting with her altogether. Nonetheless, Nellas continued watching over him, though now she remained hidden.<ref name=Doriath/>\n\nAfter Túrin's accidental slaying of [[Saeros]],<ref>{{CH|5}}, p. 90</ref> it was Nellas' account that earned him the forgiveness of his King and foster-father [[Thingol]] (though he did not know this, having already exiled himself from Doriath).<ref>{{UT|Narn}}, ''Túrin in Doriath''</ref><ref>{{CH|5}}, pp. 93-5</ref>\n\nSome time later, when [[Beleg]] brought the news of his pardon to Túrin,<ref>{{CH|6}}, p. 114</ref> he seemed not to have remembered much about Nellas, leading to Beleg rebuking him.<ref>{{UT|Narn}}, ''Túrin among the outlaws''</ref><ref>{{CH|6}}, p. 117</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''Nellas'' is in [[Sindarin]], though its meaning is never glossed. One possible meaning of the name is \"Three-leaf\", as suggested by [[David Salo]], consisting of the [[Noldorin]] element ''[[nel-]]'' (\"tri\") + Sindarin ''[[lass]]'' (\"leaf\").<ref>{{HM|GS}}, p. 356</ref>\n\nFor alternative interpretations of the name's meaning, see the entry '''[https://www.glyphweb.com/arda/n/nellas.php Nellas]''' on the ''[[Encyclopedia of Arda]]''.\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nellas}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Children of Húrin]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Sindar]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n\n[[de:Nellas]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/elfes/teleri/sindar/nellas]]\n[[fi:Nellas]]"}}}
