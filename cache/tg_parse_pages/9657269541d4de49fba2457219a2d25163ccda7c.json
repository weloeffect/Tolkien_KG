He was the father of two sons, [[Malach|Malach Aradan]] the elder, and [[Imlach]] the younger. Marach was the great-great-grandfather of [[Hador|Hador Lórindol]].\n\n==History==\nMarach's people were the most numerous of the groups of [[Men]] that moved westward over the [[Ered Luin]] in the [[First Age]] (the [[House of Hador]]). Due to the size of Marach's host they kept together and moved slowly – so much so that although Marach was originally in the lead he was passed by the people of [[Bëor]] and the [[Haladin]]. When the Haladin crossed over the mountains they were turned north by the unfriendship of the [[Green-elves]]. However, when the folk of Marach followed the Haladin a year later, marching in ordered companies of tall, warlike folk, the Elves of [[Ossiriand]] stayed out of their way.\n\nMarach's people did not tarry in Ossiriand for they had heard that the people of [[Bëor]] had found a green and fertile land. Marching down the [[Dwarf-road of Beleriand|Dwarf-road]] they settled to the south and east of the lands of [[Baran]], son of Bëor, in a region called [[Estolad]].\n\nMost of the people of Marach wanted to journey further west, so [[Malach| Malach Aradan]], the son of Marach, led them to the southern slopes of [[Ered Wethrin]]. Marach however chose to remain in Estolad until his death.<ref>{{S|West}}</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | MAR | | |MAR='''MARACH'''<br /><small>''{{FA|282}} - {{FA|376|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | |,|-|^|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree| | | | | ZIM |y| MAL | | IML |ZIM=[[Zimrahin]]<br /><small>''unknown''</small>|MAL=[[Malach]]<br /><small>''{{FA|307|n}} - {{FA|398|n}}''</small>|IML=[[Imlach]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA|310|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | | | |,|-|^|-|.| | | |!| |}}\n{{familytree| BEL |y| ADA | | MAG | | AML |BEL=[[Belemir]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA|339|n}}''</small>|ADA=[[Adanel]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA|339|n}}''</small>|MAG=[[Magor]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA|341|n}}''</small>|AML=[[Amlach]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA|337|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | |!| | | | | |!| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | BEN | | | | HAT | | | | |BEN=[[Beren (son of Belemir)|Beren]]<br /><small>b.
