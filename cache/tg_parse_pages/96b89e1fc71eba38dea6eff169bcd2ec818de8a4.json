He was the younger brother of the two Kings of the Teleri, [[Thingol|Elwë]] and [[Olwë]].\n\n== History ==\nElmo and his elder brothers were directly descended through eldest son to eldest son from [[Enel]], the first of the [[Nelyar]] to [[Awakening of the Elves|awaken]]. Unlike his older brothers who had been born by the time the Elves were found by the [[Valar]], Elmo was born during the [[Great Journey]].<ref>{{NM|P1xvii}}, p. 142</ref>\n\nHe remained behind in Beleriand after Elwë was lost in [[Nan Elmoth]] and Olwë departed for [[Valinor]]. After Elwë returned, Elmo remained with and was beloved by him.<ref name=UTG>{{UT|Galadriel}}, last paragraph before the section \"Concerning Galadriel and Celeborn\", p. 233</ref>  \n\nGiven that Elmo’s grandson [[Celeborn]] was reckoned a prince of [[Doriath]],<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref> it is likely that Elmo was likewise a prince. It is unknown if he survived the [[sack of Doriath]] or what his fate was otherwise. No specific deeds are ascribed to Elmo,<ref name=UTG/> and he is largely notable for his descendants: Celeborn, who was one of the noble Sindar, and [[Nimloth of Doriath|Nimloth]], who was briefly Queen of Doriath, when she married [[Dior]], Thingol's successor.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''Elmo'' is in [[Quenya]]. Its meaning is unclear, but it could be a combination of ''[[EL|él]]'' (being a poetic word for star) and the suffix ''[[-mo]]'' (\"person\").<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3126600909.html|articlename=Q.

One of the solutions was to establish Celeborn as the son of an unimportant brother of Thingol. Depending on the texts, Elmo is considered as a younger brother of Elwë ([[Thingol]]), the grandfather of [[Celeborn]]<ref name=concerning>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref> or his father.<ref>{{NM|P1xviii}}, p. 148</ref> \n\nIn a draft genealogy of Elwë and Elmo's descendants dated to December [[1959]] that Christopher Tolkien rejected from ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', Nimloth is the granddaughter of Elmo rather than great-granddaughter (sister rather than daughter of Galathil).<ref name=WJ>{{WJ|Years}}, p. 350</ref> \n\nIn other, later writings, Celeborn is a [[Falmari|Teler of Aman]] rather than a Sinda of Doriath, and a grandson of Olwë rather than of Elmo.<ref name=UTG/> Without further revision to Galadriel's own genealogy, this origin for Celeborn would cause the couple to [[Celeborn#Controversy|become first cousins]]. Tolkien did not develop this idea further.\n\n=== Nelwë ===\nIn ''[[The Nature of Middle-earth]]'' there appears a character called '''Nelwë'''. There, he is presented as an ancestor of [[Celeborn]] (who was an [[Falmari|elf]] of [[Aman]] in this version of his history), and a younger brother of [[Thingol|Elwë]], [[Olwë]], and [[Eärwen]].<ref group=\"note\">Eärwen is never mentioned in the above text by name - and her being a ''sister'' of Thingol and Olwë is an idea that doesn't seem to appear anywhere else in the [[legendarium]]. In all other texts, she is depicted as the ''daughter'' of Olwë instead.</ref><ref name=\"Nelw\">{{NM|P3xvi}}, p. 349</ref>\n\nThe entire text in which he appears, however, was struck through and rejected.<ref name=\"Nelw\"/> While it is not explicitly mentioned anywhere by [[Tolkien]] that the character of ''Nelwë'' is equivalent to that of ''Elmo'', or otherwise the latter's literary successor, he nonetheless fulfills the same role as an ancestor of Celeborn, in which the kinship of Celeborn and Thingol is elaborated on in a more exact manner.\n\n==== Etymology ====\nThe name ''Nelwë'' is in [[Quenya]], but its meaning is not entirely clear. The second element of the name ''[[-wë]]'' is a suffix used mainly in masculine names of the [[First Age]], being an old word for \"person\".<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, p. 340</ref> According to [[Paul Strack]], the first element of the name might be a derivation from the root [[NEL]] (\"three\").<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3621092327.html|articlename=Q.
