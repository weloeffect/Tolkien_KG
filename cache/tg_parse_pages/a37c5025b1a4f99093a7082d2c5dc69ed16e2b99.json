Its sources were the original [[Hebrew]] and Greek texts, with some contribution from later Greek and Latin translations. Members of the [[Wikipedia:Dominican Order|Dominican Order]] and other scholars at the [[Wikipedia:École Biblique|École Biblique]] in Jerusalem translated the scriptures into French, and published their work as ''La Bible de Jérusalem'' in 1956. This French translation served as the impetus for an English translation in 1966. \n\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] was among its contributors, as translator and lexicographer. The extent of Tolkien's contribution to the translation of this bible is uncertain, but he is thought to have worked on the books of Jonah and Job, and Tolkien's final draft of Jonah was heavily edited.<ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond]], ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography]]'', pp. 278-279</ref> Although the translation of the book of Job was based on what Tolkien called a bad literal French version, his sense of rightness for this task led him to prepare himself learning a great amount of Hebrew.<ref>[[Clyde S. Kilby]], ''[[Tolkien and The Silmarillion]]'', \"4. Tolkien as a Christian writer\", p. 54</ref>\n\nIn [[Letter 294]] to Charlotte and Denis Plimmer, Tolkien stated:\n\n{{blockquote|Naming me among the 'principal collaborators' was an undeserved courtesy on the part of the editor of the Jerusalem Bible. I was consulted on one or two points of style, and criticized some contributions of others. I was originally assigned a large amount of text to translate, but after doing some necessary preliminary work I was obliged to resign owing to pressure of other work, and only completed 'Jonah', one of the shortest books.}}\n\n==See also==\n*''[[The Book of Jonah]]''\n*''[[A Path from Rome|A Path from Rome: An Autobiography]]''\n*''[[The Old English Exodus]]''\n\n==External links==\n*{{WP|Jerusalem Bible}}\n* [https://www.bible-researcher.com/jerusalem-bible.html Jerusalem Bible]\n* [https://www.newman.org.uk/files/upload/Jerusalem%20bible%20A%20Crowther.pdf ''The Jerusalem Bible'' and the role of the Newman Association] \n{{references}}\n{{title|italics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jerusalem Bible}}\n[[Category:Books with contribution by J.R.R.
