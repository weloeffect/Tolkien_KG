After Tharbad, its line is dotted and disappears, suggesting (along with the name \"Old\") that it was perhaps ruined by the later [[Third Age]] and didn't go beyond Enedwaith.

In that map he \"restores\" by extrapolating the whole course of the Great Road, joining the interrupted lines.<ref>{{UT|IMap}}</ref> The label \"Old South Road\" disappears however, and is replaced by the more general label \"North-South Road\", which refers to the whole restored route.<ref name=utmap/>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2010: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Old South Road runs east from [[Tharbad]] through the regions of [[Swanfleet]], [[Enedwaith]], and [[Dunland]], ending at the [[Fords of Isen]].
