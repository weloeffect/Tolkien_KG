Hearing horses approaching, and fearing assault by Orcs, they hide behind a group of stones. However, seeing that it is an éored(a group of [[riders of Rohan]]), Aragorn hails them, saying:\"Riders of Rohan! What news from the Mark?\" Headed by Éomer, the [[éored]] turns skillfully about and quickly surrounds the three hunters in a ring of spears. [[Éomer]] asks: \"What business does an Elf, a Man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark? Speak quickly!\" \n\nGimli says, \"Tell me your name, horse-master, and I shall give you mine\". Éomer gets off his horse and insults Gimli, saying, \"I would cut off your head, Dwarf...if it stood but a little higher from the ground.\" Legolas, angered at this threat to his friend, swiftly nocks an arrow and aims it at Éomer, saying, \"You would die before your stroke fell.\" The horsemen point their spears at Legolas and things almost get out of hand, but Aragorn diffuses the situation by telling Éomer they are tracking two of their friends, hobbits, who were taken captive by the [[Uruk-hai]]. Éomer softens towards them then, telling them that the [[Rohirrim]] slaughtered the Uruk-hai in the night and left none alive. They also learn from him that [[Saruman]] has poisoned the mind of [[Théoden|the king]] and thus has control over the land. His company have been banished for being loyal to the king.\n\nHe gives them two riderless horses, [[Hasufel]] and [[Arod]], in recompense for the supposed loss of Merry and Pippin and bids them farewell, saying \"Do not trust to hope. It has forsaken these lands\".\n\n=== Watch: ===\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCwsZavV0mM\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers scenes|11]]"}}}
