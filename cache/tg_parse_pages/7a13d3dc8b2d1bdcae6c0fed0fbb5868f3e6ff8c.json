Tolkien's Women of Middle-earth: Including Sir Peter Jackson's Women of Middle-earth''''' by [[Dr Chris Barclay]] offers an analysis of the female characters in [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]’s legendarium alongside their reinterpretation in [[Peter Jackson]]’s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|film adaptations]]. Drawing on literary and film-studies approaches, the book examines how key figures such as [[Galadriel]], [[Arwen]] & [[Éowyn]] are constructed in Tolkien’s texts and transformed on screen, exploring themes of agency, gender, and narrative significance.\n\nBarclay’s work places Tolkien’s often-slim female cast in their broader mythic, cultural and cinematic contexts, showing how their roles (though relatively few in number) resonate with moral weight, thematic import and visual power.\n\n==From the publisher==\n{{blockquote|The women of J.R.R. Tolkien’s Middle-earth may have been few, but they more than made up for it by being strong, courageous and influential - they were game changers. Those familiar with The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings - books and films, will already know something of Arwen, Galadriel, Éowyn and perhaps even Lobelia Sackville-Baggins. But many more amazing women populate The Silmarillion’s tales of the ages before the War of the Ring: Elbereth, Míriel, Morwen, Idril, Elwing and of course, Lúthien to name but a few. J.R.R. Tolkien’s Women of Middle-earth celebrates these amazing women and explores the striking links many have with the women of his own lived experience: particularly Mabel his mother, Edith his wife and, the object of his lifelong devotion, The Virgin Mary - his Women of England.}}\n\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]"}}}
