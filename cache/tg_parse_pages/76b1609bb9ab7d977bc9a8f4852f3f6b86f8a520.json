All minds are \"equal in status, though they differ in capacity and strength.\" Language can also become an impediment to the development of ''ósanwe'', since it is easier for Incarnates to use which can lead to neglect.  \n\nA mind can only be communicated to with ''ósanwe'' if it is open (''sanwe-latya'', \"thought opening, telepathy\"). Any mind can be willed closed, and this is a barrier that cannot be overcome by anything or anyone, not even by [[Melkor]] applying all his power and will. \n\nThe ability for communication can be strengthened through various means: from affinity between the persons communicating, urgency on the part of the person sending the thought, or their authority lending effectiveness, allowing thought to pass through bodies more easily.<ref>{{NM|P2ix}}</ref> \n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''\n:When the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] arrives in [[Caras Galadhon]], [[Galadriel]] telepathically talks to them about the fate of [[Gandalf]] and specifically greets [[Frodo]].
