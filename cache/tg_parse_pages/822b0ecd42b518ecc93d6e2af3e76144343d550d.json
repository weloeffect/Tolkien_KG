It was perched upon high terraces that looked towards the sea. It was never visited by the servants of [[Morgoth]] but after its abandonment it became weathered. Turgon's great hall had its walls and roof covered with a deep growth of plants.<ref name=\"Tuor\">{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nVinyamar was the first recorded [[Noldor]] stone construction after they had returned to [[Middle-earth]].<ref name=\"Tuor\"/> Vinyamar's population was primarily Noldorin, with a large influx of [[Sindar]]in elves.\n\nIn {{FA|50}}<ref name=\"GA|74\">{{GA|74}}</ref> Turgon and [[Finrod]] took a journey along the river [[Sirion]]. At the [[Meres of Twilight]] they slept and both received a dream from [[Ulmo]], bidding them to seek places of strength.<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref> Two years later<ref>{{GA|76}}</ref> Turgon discovered the hidden way and vale of [[Tumladen]] wherein he determined to build [[Gondolin]]. In {{FA|64}} Turgon led a third of his people to the valley to begin construction of his hidden city.<ref>{{GA|88}}</ref> By {{FA|116}} Gondolin was full-wrought and Turgon led the remainder of his folk to the city; from then on Vinyamar was abandoned and fell into decay.<ref>{{GA|113}}</ref>\n\nMuch later, in {{FA|495}}, [[Tuor]] came to the deserted settlement. Marvelling, he entered Turgon's old [[High Seat of Vinyamar|hall]] and on a wall, lit by the setting sun, he found a shield, hauberk, helm, and sword. The shield bore a field of blue and a white swan's wing. Tuor took these items and wore them. In the meantime, [[Voronwë]] was rescued by [[Ulmo]] from a shipwreck and was brought near the city; when the two met, they left Vinyamar together for a journey that led to Gondolin.<ref name=\"Tuor\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name is [[Quenya]] for \"New Home\" from ''[[vinya]]'' \"young, new\" and ''[[már]]'' \"house, home, dwelling\".<ref>{{S|Index}}, ''Vinyamar''</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Beleriand]]\n[[Category:Cities, towns and villages]]\n[[Category:Noldor]]\n[[Category:Quenya locations]]\n[[de:Vinyamar]]\n[[fi:Vinyamar]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/villes tours et forteresses/beleriand/vinyamar]]"}}}
