It speaks in short of [[Fëanor]]'s speech and the [[Oath of Fëanor|Oath]], that he and his [[Sons of Fëanor|sons]] spake.  It also speeks in brief of the deeds of the [[Noldor]], such as the rescue of [[Maedhros]] by [[Fingon]].  It tells of how [[Barahir]], the father of [[Beren]], aided [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] during the [[Siege of Angband]].  Then how Beren made his way to [[Nargothrond]], asking for Felagund's aid in the Quest for the [[Silmaril]], giving the greatest speech he made in his life about the beauty of [[Lúthien]].  Though Felagund was moved, he feared the power of [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]], who took the Oath and were very influential in Nargothrond, despite his own oath to Barahir.  Then the two brothers stood and spoke, and so masterful were their voices that for many years after no elf of Nargothrond went to war for a long time.  Therefore the people would not follow Felagund on this quest, and he took with him only ten, giving his crown to [[Orodreth]].  \"''Then Celegorm no more would stay,/And Curufin smiled and turned away''\"."}}}
