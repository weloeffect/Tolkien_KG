The Hall of Lore was invented for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'' by [[Amazon Studios]].  \n\n== History ==\nThe Hall of Lore was built by [[Elros]] himself. According to [[Elendil]], the only reason why it still stands was because of [[Tar-Palantir]].\n\nDuring the late [[Second Age]], Elendil is tasked by [[Tar-Míriel|Queen Regent Míriel]] to guard [[Galadriel]], making sure that she does not do anything to harm Númenor. Elendil takes Galadriel to the Hall of Lore, travelling a quarter day’s ride to get there.\n\nUpon arriving at the Hall of Lore, Galadriel learns from Elendil that their last king, [[Tar-Palantir]], is still alive and loyal to the [[Elves]]. She also learns that the sigil that she sought the meaning of is actually a map of the [[Mordor|Southlands]]. The parchment tells of a plan to be enacted after the defeat of [[Morgoth]].\n\n== Deviation from Lore ==\nThere is no reference to the Hall of Lore in [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s writings. It may have been inspired by the Gondorian Archives shown early on in [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|movie adaptation]] of ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]],'' which depicts a series of rooms filled with scrolls and dusty old manuscripts.  \n\nNone of the writings of J.R.R Tolkien mention Galadriel having personally visited [[Númenor]]. She was travelling with her husband [[Celeborn]] and establishing a kingdom of her own at the time when the series is set. In Tolkien's work, [[Tar-Míriel|Míriel]] was also never Queen Regent because her father, [[Tar-Palantir]], was never deposed or forced to resign from his throne. \n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) locations]]"}}}
