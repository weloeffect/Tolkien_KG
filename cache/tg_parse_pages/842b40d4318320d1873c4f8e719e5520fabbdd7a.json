The line was broken twice, once by [[Thorin I]] (he and four generations of his descendants ruled from the [[Grey Mountains]], not Lonely Mountain), and once by the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Smaug]] (who claimed the title for himself). In both cases, the line was restored to a rightful heir.\n\n== The Line of Kings under the Mountain ==\n# [[Thráin I]]\n# [[Thorin I]] – abandoned the Kingdom for the [[Grey Mountains]]\n# [[Thrór]] – restored the Kingdom but lost it to [[Smaug]]\n# [[Smaug]] - claimed title and kingdom after the [[Sack of Erebor]]\n# [[Thorin|Thorin II Oakenshield]] – regained the Kingdom\n# [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin II Ironfoot]] - reigned after Thorin's death in the [[Battle of Five Armies]]\n# [[Thorin Stonehelm|Thorin III Stonehelm]]\n\n==Inspiration==\nThe term \"[[Wikipedia:King under the Mountain|King under the Mountain]]\" is a philological term for a certain motif in various mythologies and folklore around the world. It refers to a kingly figure who remains hidden in a mountain or cave until a messianic return at the appointed time.\n\nAccording to the Wikipedia article, the motif is also present at several points in [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s [[legendarium]]: [[Ar-Pharazôn]] with his [[Great Armament]] was buried in the [[Caves of the Forgotten]] beneath the [[Pelóri]] until the [[Dagor Dagorath|End of the World]]; the [[King of the Dead]] and the [[Oathbreakers|Men of the Mountains]] in [[Dunharrow]], who returned to fulfill their oath; and of course the King under the Mountain himself, with Thorin's return to Erebor. Other figures can include [[Fëanor]] and [[Túrin]] (said to return from the dead at the [[Dagor Dagorath]]); and the [[Kings of Gondor|King of Gondor]] (with [[Aragorn]] as the returned King).\n\n{{durinskings}}\n[[Category:Dwarven titles]]\n[[Category:Kings under the Mountain| ]]"}}}
