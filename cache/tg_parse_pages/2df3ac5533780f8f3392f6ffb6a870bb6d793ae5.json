There are also some references that are out of context, like the [[Númenóreans]], which indicate that the text was written during or after the [[Second Age]].\n\n== Synopsis==\n===Of the Valar===\n''Valar'' (the \"Powers of Arda\") is the name given to the chief [[Ainur]] following their descent to [[Arda]]. The Ainur were angelic spirits created by the supreme deity, [[Ilúvatar]]. The most powerful of the [[Valar]] was [[Morgoth|Melkor]], who became corrupt, and ceased to follow the will of Ilúvatar. The fourteen remaining Valar continued in Ilúvatar's will.\n\nThe Ainur had either male or female forms, some were couples, while some were siblings in Ilúvatar's mind. Thus, there were seven male Valar, and seven female (''[[Valier]]''). Of the fourteen, those eight with the greatest might (called [[Aratar]]) were responsible for some attribute of life in [[Arda]] (e.g., crafts, mining, agriculture, etc.). The king of the Valar, and of all [[Arda]] was [[Manwë]].\n\n===Of the Maiar===\nOn their descent to Arda, the Valar, were followed by Ainur of lesser might, the [[Maiar]], who were their subjects, students and assistants in governing Arda. The Valar had the ability to change their physical appearance, or to bear no shape at all.\n\n===Of the Enemies===\nOf the enemies are mentioned Melkor, [[Sauron]] and the [[Balrogs]], spirits who were seduced by him and fell into hate.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Valaquenta'' is [[Quenya]] for \"Account of the Valar\", from the roots ''[[Valar|Vala]]'' (\"powers\")<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, ''val-''</ref><ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> and ''[[quenta]]'' (\"story, account\").{{fact}}\n\n== History of composition ==\n<!-- This should be rewritten as how it was edited by Chistopher -->\nAlthough sequential descriptions of the Valar go back to ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]'', the earliest writing that resembles the Valaquenta is found in the text called ''[[Quenta Noldorinwa]]''.<ref>{{SM|Quenta}}</ref> It then became Chapter 1 of the ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'' (entitled ''Of the Valar''). In revisions to the Quenta Silmarillion done in 1958, the section was split off into a separately titled work.<ref>{{MR|P3II1}}</ref>  There is nothing to indicate why Tolkien felt that the piece should stand alone.  While it is not a narrative, neither is the chapter ''[[Of Beleriand and its Realms]]'', and Tolkien never seems to have considered removing that section.\n\nWithin the [[legendarium]], it is assumed that the ''Valaquenta'' was preserved through ''[[Translations from the Elvish]]'' by [[Bilbo Baggins]].<ref>{{FR|Records}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Books and documents within the legendarium]]\n[[Category:The Silmarillion chapters]]\n[[Category:Manuscripts by J.R.R.
