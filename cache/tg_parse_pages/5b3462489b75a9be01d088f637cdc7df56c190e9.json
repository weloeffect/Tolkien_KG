In a Latin language ''hobbits'' looks dreadful, and if I had been earlier consulted I would have readily agreed to some naturalization of the form, e.g. ''hobitos'', which consorts better with the long-adopted ''elfos'', while having the good fortune to contain the normal Sp[anish] diminutive suffix, and a stem ''hob-'', which as far as I know has no associations in Spanish.|<ref name=G/><ref>{{CG|RG}}, p. 1035</ref>}}\n\nIn the words of [[Christina Scull]] and [[Wayne G. Hammond]], Tolkien also apologizes to Dadlez for \"not replying sooner, but mail had not been forwarded despite his arrangements\", and writes that the \"most important point to make to the translator of ''The Hobbit'' into Spanish is that if he uses ''gnomos'' for [[dwarves]], it must not be used in the phrase 'the [[elves]] that are now called [[gnomes]]'\".<ref name=G/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Letter to Alina Dadlez (19 September 1962)]]\n*[[Letter 239]]\n{{references}}\n{{title}}\n[[Category:Letters|Dadlez, Alina (1962-05-20)]]\n[[Category:Letters to Alina Dadlez]]"}}}
