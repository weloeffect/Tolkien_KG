This ruling would ultimately have a major effect upon the history of the [[Noldor]] and the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] in general.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\n[[File:Lady Elleth - Miriel in Lorien.png|225px|thumb|left|''Míriel in Lórien'' by [[:Category:Images by Lady Elleth|Lady Elleth]]]]\n[[Finwë]], the first [[King of the Noldor]], and his wife [[Míriel|Míriel Þerindë]] had their first child, [[Fëanor]]. Unfortunately, the strain of bearing Fëanor caused Míriel to become weary and die. She left her body and went to the [[Halls of Mandos]].<ref name=s_feanor>{{S|Feanor}}</ref>\n\nWhile there were many houseless [[fëar]] which had been summoned to [[Aman]] to keep them from the Darkness, Míriel's was the first death to occur in [[Aman]], and it greatly troubled the Valar. Therefore, [[Manwë]] consulted directly with [[Ilúvatar]], and from Him received the authority to re-house those among the houseless who so consented.<ref>{{MR|P4q}}</ref>\n\nFor a while after this Finwë was patient with Míriel, but she continued to refuse to return to life. Eventually he became deeply saddened by her absence, especially as he wished to have more children. He went again to the Valar for their wisdom and council. Finwë's petition proved very difficult as the Valar could not force Míriel to return against her will, but they also felt it was injustice for Finwë's happiness to be constrained by her choice.<ref name=s_feanor/>\n\n===Proclamation===\nThe Valar made the Statute regarding the severance of marriage among the Eldar in the case of Finwë and Míriel and, after a great debate, it was proclaimed by [[Mandos]] from the [[Mahanaxar|Doom-hill]]. The debate was recorded among the books of Law, known as '''''Namna Finwë Míriello'''''.\n\n{{blockquote|When the spirit of a spouse, husband or wife, shall for any cause pass into the keeping of Mandos, then the living may be permitted lawfully to take another spouse, if the former union be dissolved for ever.}}\n\nMandos explained that this dissolution of the marriage only happens by the will of the Dead or because a soul has been condemned to be in the Halls of Mandos till the end of Arda. Remarriage could only occur in this manner because, if the dead spouse returned to life and found his or her partner remarried, strife would result. Furthermore, because Elvish males and females were equal, the simultaneous union of one to more than one of the opposite sex was seen as unnatural. Because marriage was chiefly a union of the body, remarriage could occur only if one of the spouses was unbodied, and intended to remain so until the end of time (since marriage was supposed to be a life-long union). Since it was deemed wrong for the living spouse to constrain the dead one to remain unbodied, the living could not remarry unless the dead permitted them to.\n\nThe judgment was made known to Míriel, and she refused to return to life, even after being summoned and warned by Mandos. Nonetheless, Mandos proclaimed that twelve years had to pass till the disunion was official.<ref name=Later>{{MR|P3II4}}, pp. 256-262</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nThe story is presented several times throughout ''[[Morgoth's Ring]]'', the tenth volume of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', and in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', the twelfth volume.\n\nIn ''[[The Earliest Version of the Story of Finwë and Míriel]]'', Finwë seeks counsel from the Valar ''two'' years after Míriel's death and Mandos proclaims the Statute with the following terms for disunion: ''after the giving of the consent ten years of the Valar shall pass ere Mandos confirms it.  Within that time either party may revoke this consent; but when Mandos has confirmed it, and the living spouse has wedded another, it shall be irrevocable until the end of Arda''. Míriel is informed and confirms her choice.  ''Ten'' years later the doom of disunion is spoken and after another three years Finwë weds Indis.<ref>{{MR|P3II2}}, pp. 205-207</ref> It is this version of the story which has dates that align with the [[Annals of Aman]].\n\nIn ''[[Laws and Customs Among the Eldar]]'', the events remain similar, though Finwë seeks counsel after ''ten'' years, the Debate of the Valar is introduced, and it is not explicitly stated that the choice is irrevocable after the living spouse's second marriage. Míriel's body remains unmarred until she retakes it with the abnegation of Finwë, following his death, as her ransom.<ref>{{MR|P3II3d}}, pp. 236-238</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Later Versions of the Story of Finwë and Míriel]]'', Finwë seeks counsel after ''twelve'' years, and the time between the declaration of the will of the Dead and pronouncement of the doom of disunion is also increased to ''twelve'' years. The living spouse getting remarried is also restated as a condition to make the decision irrevocable.<ref name=Later />\n\nIn ''[[The Shibboleth of Fëanor]]'', Finwë, after his \"''sorrow having became embittered''\", takes the initiative in reclaiming his life and in his wanderings meets, and subsequently desires to wed, Indis.  At this point he seeks counsel with the Valar, they have their great debate, and the marriage is sanctioned.  Once he is married Míriel's body is to swiftly wither and pass away with the Valar not to restore it.<ref>{{PM|Case}}, pp. 333-335</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Books and documents within the legendarium]]\n[[Category:Creations of the Valar]]\n[[Category:First Age]]\n[[Category:Noldor]]\n[[Category:Oaths and prophecies]]"}}}
