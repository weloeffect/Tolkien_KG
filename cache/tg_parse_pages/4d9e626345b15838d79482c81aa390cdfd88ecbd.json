This time [[Sauron]] was not able to launch a full attack, as the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]] that had taken place more than a century earlier had eliminated most of the [[Orcs]] in the north, and the [[Haradrim]] had been badly defeated in {{TA|2885|n}}.<ref name=\"TA\"/>\n\nThe winter was also less harsh than the Long Winter, and snow and ice stopped in [[Eriador]] at the [[Gwathló|Greyflood]] River, and in  [[Rhovanion|Wilderland]] in the middle of [[Mirkwood]]. Nevertheless, there were severe problems, as food again ran short, and the [[Hobbits]] of [[the Shire]] were attacked by [[White Wolves]], which crossed the frozen [[Brandywine]] river.<ref>{{FR|II3}}</ref> It was on this occasion that the [[Horn-call of Buckland]] had been sounded; it was not heard again until [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] invaded [[Buckland]] in {{TA|3018|n}}.<ref>{{FR|I11}}</ref> [[Gandalf]] and the [[Rangers of the North]] had to provide food for the Hobbits to prevent them from dying of hunger.\n\nIn March when the winter ended great floods of meltwater rushed down [[Gwathló|Greyflood]], and the city of [[Tharbad]] was ruined and its bridge broken. The people of [[Enedwaith]] also suffered greatly as their lands were flooded.<ref name=\"TA\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Fell Winter (First Age)]]\n* [[Long Winter]]\n\n{{references}}\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq\n| prev=[[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]]\n| list=Major events of [[Middle-earth]]\n| dates={{TA|2911}} - {{TA|2912}}\n| next=[[Quest of Erebor]]\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n{{title}}\n[[Category:Periods]]\n[[Category:History of the Shire]]\n\n[[de:Grausamer Winter]]\n[[fr:encyclo/evenements/3a/rude hiver]]\n[[fi:Tuima Talvi (Kolmas Aika)]]"}}}
