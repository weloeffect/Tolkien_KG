However, she and Bombadil are enigmas.<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://tolkien.slimy.com/essays/Bombadil4Spirits.html|articlename=What is Tom Bombadil? Viable Theories: A Nature Spirit?|author=Steuard Jensen|website=[[Tolkien FAQ]]}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[Buckland]]ish poem ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil (poem)|The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'', Goldberry was in the [[Withywindle]] when she pulled Tom by his beard under the [[water-lilies]] out of mischief, but he ordered her to let him free. One day, he came to the [[River-woman]] and asked Goldberry to be his wife, and the creatures of the [[Old Forest]] (the [[badger-folk]] and other animals) attended their wedding.<ref>{{AB|1}}</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|3018}} Tom Bombadil travelled to the lower reaches of the Withywindle to gather white water-lilies for her, and it was while returning from a lily-gathering expedition that he discovered [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and his companions, and rescued them from [[Old Man Willow]].<ref>{{FR|I6}}</ref> Goldberry seems to have used her lilies to recreate her original home in the river: when Tom brought the [[Hobbits]] back to his house, they found a seated Goldberry surrounded by water-lilies floating in pots of earthenware.<ref>{{FR|I7}}</ref>\n\nGoldberry welcomed and tended the [[travellers]] to their [[Underhill (house)|home]]. The [[hobbits]] thought of her as a beautiful and calm being, with a beauty resembling an [[Elf]] but less exotic to their hearts. Her voice was described as \"the song of a glad water ... coming down like silver\". The hobbits would listen to her sing in a voice like rain, and they would imagine rivers and pools.\n\n==Inspiration==\n[[Tolkien]] wrote that Goldberry \"''represents the actual seasonal changes in [river-lands].''\"<ref>{{L|210}}</ref>\n\nIn her first appearance in the poem, she is displayed  as a typical mischievous water-sprite, responsible for pulling and drowning humans into rivers and lakes.<ref>{{AB|Comm}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Goldberry in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring (video game) - Goldberry.jpg|Goldberry in [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game - Goldberry, River-daughter.jpg|Goldberry in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Goldberry.jpg|Goldberry in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\nFile:Marie Magny - Goldberry, River-daughter.jpg|Goldberry in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-earth]]''\nFile:Andrea Piparo - Goldberry.jpg|Goldberry in ''[[War of the Ring: The Card Game]]''\n</gallery>\n'''1955: [[The Lord of the Rings (1955 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1955 radio series)]]:'''\n:Because adaptor [[Terence Tiller]] thought the age difference between Bombadil and Goldberry was too big, he made them father and daughter.<ref name=\"CG\">{{CG|RG}}, \"Adaptations\", pp. 8-23</ref> [[J.R.R.

Unlike Tom (played by Milan Lasica), Goldberry has no spoken lines, and she is only heard singing harmoniously as Tom and his four hobbit guests arrive at his house.

Her origin however, is greatly elaborated upon: she is a River-maiden, a spirit that watches over the streams and rivers. Goldberry's sisters can be found in the [[Lone-lands]], [[Nenuial]], the [[Gladden]], [[Gilrain]], [[Serni]] and [[Erui]]. Some show themselves openly, others are secretive and only reveal themselves to the Wise and the descendants of the [[Númenóreans]] who had known of River-maidens in the years of old. But some were driven mad by the bloodshed spilled over their waters, or slain and devoured by the servants of the Enemy who then take on their fair appearance.\n\n==External links==\n* [https://greyhavensgroup.com/2014/08/23/goldberry-servant-or-master-of-bombadil/ Goldberry - Servant or Master of Bombadil?] by Andrea Mathwich\n* [https://middle-earth.xenite.org/2014/11/28/what-kind-of-creature-is-goldberry/ What Kind of Creature is Goldberry?] by [[Michael Martinez]]\n* [https://priyasethtolkienfan.wordpress.com/2016/10/10/goldberry/ The Enigmatic Mrs Bombadil] by Priya Seth\n\n{{References}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Goldberry}}\n\n[[Category:Characters in The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]\n[[Category:Enigmas]]\n[[Category:Forest-folk]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[de:Goldbeere]]\n[[fr:encyclo:personnages:baie d or]]\n[[fi:Kultamarja]]"}}}
