The book is noteworthy for its collection of Tolkien art by [[Angus McBride]].\n\n==Cover/Jacket Text== \n \nIn a fantasy role playing game, you become the main character in an adventure you create. With Angus McBride's Characters of Middle-earth your fantasy campaign will feature more than merely a mind's eye view of the famous and infamous characters from J.R.R. Tolkien's THE HOBBIT and THE LORD OF THE RINGS. Twenty nine full-color plates (unmarred by text) bring these powerful individuals to life along with portraits of lesser known adventurers to be used by players in a Middle-earth game.\n\nThis volume describes individuals, both prominent and obscure, who roam Tolkien's world. Portrayed by Angus McBride for use by Gamemasters as NPCs or by Players as PCs, each color plate is accompanied by a page of relevant text. A brief fantasy description of the action, a note on the setting, a description, of the characters depicted, and full game statistics for the MERP and Rolemaster systems are included. These stats can be easily converted to most major FRP systems.\n\nWhen Gandalf, the Witch-king, or Galadriel arrives on the scene, Gamemasters will now have an illustration to display. And each player can possess a full-color rendering of his or her character. As Marhic, flee Low Nose the Asdriag through the streets of seedy Strayhold. Combat a camel-mounted Silent One as Mairan of Greater Harad. Or hold your breath as Ehlissa when a dread Wraith looks your way.\n\nInside you'll find:\n\n*FAMOUS CHARACTERS - \n**FANGORN offering nourishment to Pippin and Merry \n**GALADRIEL responding to a plea from a wounded Silvan messenger \n**SARUMAN snared by Sauron through the Orthanc Palantír \n**Éowyn and Merry confronting the Lord of the Nazgûl \n**CELEMBRIMBOR at the forge \n*ADVENTURERS SEEKING FAME - \n**ORRIT KELARIN reliving his encounter with the heinous Birdman of the Suza Sumar \n**MANARI AKAJI sorely pressed by a Desert Screamer \n**ARAMATH, a Cardolani squire, supporting his lord against the mysterious Woses of the Black Wood and many more \n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:MERP]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
