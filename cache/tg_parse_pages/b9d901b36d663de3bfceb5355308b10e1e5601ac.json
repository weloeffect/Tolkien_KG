He was said to be the maternal great-great-grandfather of [[Augustus Bonifacius]], who was the king of the [[Middle Kingdom]] when [[Farmer Giles]] lived in the realm.  He had also owned a famous sword called [[Caudimordax]] which had languished in the king's armoury.  When Farmer Giles chased off a [[The Giant|giant]] that had come to the village of [[Ham]], the king made a present of the sword to the rustic.  Thus, in a sense, Giles was the heir of Bellomarius.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]''</ref>\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Farmer Giles of Ham]]\n[[fi:Bellomarius]]"}}}
