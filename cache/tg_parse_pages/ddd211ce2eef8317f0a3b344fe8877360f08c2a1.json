The main characters are [[Frodo Baggins]], [[Elrond]], [[Aragorn]], [[Gandalf]], [[Glorfindel]], [[Boromir]], [[Legolas]], [[Gimli]], [[Bilbo Baggins]] and [[Glóin]].\n\nThe chapter is pivotal to [[The Fellowship of the Ring]] volume, its events setting the foundation for the epic journey that follows. It tells of a gathering of representatives from various peoples of [[Middle-earth]] in [[Rivendell]] to discuss the matter of the [[One Ring]]. It reveals the history of [[the One Ring]], Aragorn's heritage as [[Isildur]]'s heir, Bilbo's past as a former [[Ring-bearer]], Frodo's journey from the Shire, [[Gollum]]'s capture and [[Saruman]]’s betrayal and imprisonment of Gandalf at [[Orthanc]]. It confirms that the Ring cannot be wielded for good and must be destroyed in the fires of [[Mount Doom]], the task accepted by Frodo.\n\n==Overview==\nThe chapter begins the morning after the end of the [[Many Meetings|previous chapter]].\n\n===The Council begins===\nFrodo and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] walked within [[Rivendell]] and ran into Gandalf and Bilbo. As Frodo expressed his desire to explore the surrounding wilderness, Gandalf said that discussion and decision-making were the priority of the day. At that moment, a bell rang out to summon all to the [[Council of Elrond|council]]. Sam followed the others even though he was not invited.\n\nThe council took place on the same porch where Frodo had reunited with [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] the previous evening. Among the many attendants, Frodo spotted Elrond, Glorfindel and Glóin, as well as [[Strider]] wearing his worn travel clothes again. Gandalf introduces Frodo to the attendants:\n\n{{quote|Here, my friends, is the hobbit, Frodo son of Drogo. Few have ever come hither through greater peril or on an errand more urgent.|[[Gandalf]]}}\n\nGandalf pointed out several important figures to Frodo: Glóin's son, Gimli; [[Erestor]], Elrond's chief counselor; [[Galdor]], a messenger from [[Cirdan the Shipwright]] of the [[Grey Havens]]; and [[Legolas]], son of [[Thranduil]], King of the Elves of [[Mirkwood]]. Frodo also noted a [[Men|Man]] sitting apart from the others, wearing rich but travel-worn clothes and holding a [[Great Horn|great horn]]. Gandalf gave the man's name as [[Boromir]] who had arrived that morning from the south, seeking counsel.\n\nMany tales were told about the goings-on in the greater world to the south and east. Frodo had already heard some of this information, but paid close attention when Glóin spoke. \n\n====Of the Dwarves of Erebor====\nGlóin explained that the [[Dwarves]] of [[Erebor]] had grown disquiet, and some decided to attempt to reconquer [[Moria]] under the [[Misty Mountains]]:\n\n{{quote|Moria! Moria! Wonder of the Northern world! Too deep we delved there, and woke the nameless fear. Long have its vast mansions lain empty since the children of Durin fled. But now we spoke of it again with longing, and yet with dread; for no dwarf has dared to pass the doors of Khazad-dûm for many lives of kings, save Thrór only, and he perished.|[[Glóin]]}}\n\nGlóin explained that thirty years prior, against King [[Dáin]]'s wishes, [[Balin]] took [[Ori]] and [[Óin]] together with a multitude of other Dwarves on a quest to retake the city. While news at first indicated that they had been successful and prosperous, the messages soon ceased.\n\nAccording to Glóin, one year ago a messenger from [[Mordor]] arrived at Erebor. The messenger wanted to forge a friendship between [[Sauron]] and the Dwarves. He began asking questions about creatures called [[Hobbits]] - what they were and where they lived - and indicated that Sauron knows that the Dwarves have met one.\n\n{{quote|As a small token only of your friendship Sauron asks this: that you should find this thief, and get from him, willing or no, a little ring, the least of rings, that once he stole. It is but a trifle that Sauron fancies, and an earnest of your good will.|[[Sauron]]'s messenger to [[Erebor]]}}\n\nIn return for this information, the messenger promised Dáin three of the lost [[Seven Dwarf-rings|Dwarf-rings]], as well as a guarantee that Moria shall belong to the Dwarves forever. Dáin became very suspicious of this, and refused to give an answer immediately. The messenger gave a veiled threat and rode away. That messenger visited twice more and received the same answer, and then promised to come one final time before the end of the year. The Dwarves have since learned that similar messengers had also been sent to King [[Brand]] of [[Dale]].\n\nThe Dwarves and Men of the North now feared that Mordor was about to attack them. Dáin sent Glóin to Rivendell to warn Bilbo that the Enemy might come for him, and to ask for Elrond's counsel on the matter. Elrond commended Dáin on this decision, but said that the Dwarves have no choice but to resist, with or without hope. He reassured them that they were not alone as the trouble belonged to all of the western world.\n\n====Tale of the Ring====\nElrond explained the ancient history of the [[One Ring]] in full - a tale before known to few. First, he told of the forging of the [[Rings of Power]] during the [[Second Age]]. According to Elrond, the Elves of [[Eregion]] and Dwarves of Moria were once friends. During this time, the Elves' eagerness for knowledge made them susceptible to Sauron's charms, who at the time did not appear in his evil form. The Dark Lord learned their arts and crafted the One Ring in secret at [[Orodruin]] to control the others. Only [[Celebrimbor]] suspected him, and hid the [[Three Rings]] that he had created without Sauron's aid. A war ensued, during which the land of Eregion was destroyed and the gate of Moria was shut.\n\nThroughout the rest of the morning, Elrond continued the story of the One Ring during the Second Age. He spoke of the fall of [[Númenor]] and the arrival of [[Men of the West]] in [[Middle-earth]]. He told of [[Elendil]] and his sons, [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]], who founded the northern kingdom of [[Arnor]] and southern kingdom of [[Gondor]]. Sauron assaulted their kingdoms, and the [[Last Alliance]] was forged between Elendil and [[Gil-Galad]] to defeat him.\n\nElrond said he remembered those days clearly, prompting Frodo how this was possible as it had happened so long ago. Elrond briefly explained his lineage, descending from [[Eärendil]] and [[Elwing]], and noted that he had lived through all thee [[Ages]] of the western world.\n\nHe then described the [[Battle of Dagorlad]], at which he was present. The armies of the Last Alliance had stood before the [[Black Gate]] of Mordor, and could not be stopped by the evil forces. He told of the [[Siege of Barad-dûr]] that followed, where Gil-Galad and Elendil were killed. Isildur picked up his father's broken sword, [[Narsil]], and with it cut the Ring from Sauron's hand, destroying the Dark Lord and taking the Ring for himself.\n\nAt this, Boromir suddenly interjected, surprised to hear that Isildur took the Ring; the story had been forgotten to his people, who thought that the Ring had been destroyed that day. Elrond said that he witnessed the event personally: together with Gil-galad and Cirdan he tried to convince Isildur to destroy the Ring, then and there. Isildur refused, however, claiming the Ring as compensation for his father's and brother's deaths. Elrond then spoke of Isildur's ambush by [[Orcs]] at the [[Gladden Fields]], where he lost the Ring. He noted that Isildur's squire, [[Ohtar]], survived the ambush and brought the broken shards of Narsil back to Rivendell, where Isildur's heir [[Valandil]] lived under supervision, as he was only a child at the time.\n\nElrond concluded the tale, saying that because the Ring was not destroyed, Sauron was not wholly destroyed either. He explained that Elves and Men had since become estranged with the decay of Númenor: men lived shorter lives and the Elves were decreasing in numbers. The city of [[Annúminas]] had fallen into ruin, and the heirs of Valandil had moved to [[Fornost]], which was eventually destroyed by the forces of [[Angmar]].\n\n====Of Gondor====\nElrond then described the annals of the realm of Gondor to the south, which still endured. Its capital once resided in [[Osgiliath]], astride both sides of the [[Anduin|Great River]]. The Men of Gondor had built [[Minas Ithil]], a tower on the western slopes of the [[Ephel Dúath|Mountains of Shadow]], to guard against the evil creatures of Mordor. They then built the corresponding tower of [[Minas Anor]] on the eastern end of the [[White Mountains]]. At the top of Minas Anor was planted a [[White Tree of Gondor|white tree]], descended from a tree that once grew in the [[Valinor|Uttermost West]] in the early days of the world. Eventually, the line of kings [[Anárion]] and [[Meneldil]] failed, Númenorean blood mingled with that of \"lesser men\", and the tree withered. The men of Gondor failed in their vigil against Mordor, resulting in foul creatures conquering Minas Ithil (now renamed [[Minas Morgul]], the Tower of Sorcery). Minas Anor was renamed [[Minas Tirith]] (the Tower of Guard), and Osgiliath evacuated of its population. Gondor and Mordor had been at war ever since.\n\nAs Elrond finished speaking, Boromir revealed Gondor as his homeland. He proceeded to inform the others present of its current state. He claimed that the blood of Númenor had not yet been spent, and that only by the valour of his countrymen in their constant battle against Morgul were the lands beyond Gondor kept safe and peaceful. He warned that Gondor's day of defeat may not be far off, as evil had awoken in Mordor once more. He described that in June the Forces of Mordor invaded and conquered [[Ithilien]] - Gondor's land to the east of the Anduin. Boromir claimed that Mordor was allied with the [[Easterlings]] and [[Haradrim]], and that their armies were strengthening due to some great power - a great black horseman whose mere presence inflicted fear on the bravest of men. The Gondorians had since scuttled the bridge connecting both sides of Osgiliath, cutting themselves off from Ithilien but also preventing the enemy from crossing the Anduin there. Boromir and [[Faramir|his brother]] were present at the battle, and made it back across the river with only two soldiers remaining. Boromir expressed his fear that Gondor had no other ally, except Rohan to its west.\n\nBoromir explained that he traveled alone to Rivendell to seek Elrond's counsel regarding a dream that he and his brother had each separately experienced. In this dream, shadows and thunder came from the east, but in the west was still a pale light; then a voice crying from the west:\n\n{{quote|Seek for the Sword that was broken;<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Imladris it dwells;<br/>There shall be counsels taken<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stronger than Morgul-spells.<br/>There shall be shown a token<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Doom is near at hand,<br/>For Isildur's Bane shall waken<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the Halfling forth shall stand.|[[Boromir]]'s Dream}}\n\nBoromir described that he and his brother went to their father, [[Denethor]], Lord of Minas Tirith, and consulted with him about this dream. Denethor recognized the name \"Imladris\" as the home of Elrond, far away to the north. Boromir's brother volunteered to seek it, but Boromir realized the dangerous nature of the journey and took the quest upon himself, despite his father's objections.\n\n====Of Aragorn====\nAt this, Aragorn stood and placed his broken sword on the table, identifying it as the sword mentioned in Boromir's dream. Elrond introduced Aragorn to Boromir and the others as a direct descendant of Isildur. Frodo immediately exclaimed that the Ring should be given to Aragorn, but Aragorn rejects ownership of it. Elrond instead bade Frodo to hold up the Ring for all to see.\n\nFighting a strong reluctance to reveal the Ring, Frodo eventually did so. Elrond introduced the Ring to the others as \"Isildur's Bane\" - Sauron's Ruling Ring. Boromir was immediately dismayed, believing that it signaled doom for his homeland. Aragorn asked Boromir whether he wished for the House of Elendil to return to Gondor. Boromir gave no clear answer; he seemed desperate, but doubtful.\n\n{{Quote|I was not sent to beg any boon, but to seek only the meaning of a riddle. Yet we are hard pressed, and the Sword of Elendil would be a help beyond our hope - if such a thing could indeed return out of the shadows of the past.|[[Boromir]]}}\n\nBilbo leapt up and recited a [[Riddle of Strider|riddle]], which concludes with the line: \"The crownless again shall be king.\" As he sat back down, he revealed to Frodo that it was he who had written that song after first meeting Aragorn.\n\nAragorn explained a little of his background to Boromir, saying that Narsil has been passed down diligently from [[Valandil]] to each of his successive heirs, ending up with Aragorn. He forgave Boromir for doubting him, admitting that he appeared nothing like Isildur or the kings of old, but claimed to have made many journeys and fought many servants of the Enemy; just like Gondor in the South, the Dúnedain had been protecting the lands in the north. He told Boromir that the Dúnedain's task was more thankless than Gondor's, as they were given scornful names by the very people they protect, and their work must always be kept secret from the simple folk.\n\nAragorn concluded by announcing that he would go to Minas Tirith to aid in the coming battle. Boromir expressed doubts about the Ring's identity, asking many questions about it and the story of its recovery. Bilbo asked to adjourn for refreshments before that story was told, but Elrond asked him to tell his story first. Before Bilbo began his tale, he apologized if any of those present (particularly Glóin) had heard him tell it differently before; he was simply hoping to keep the Ring for himself and avoid being called a \"thief\".\n\n====Of Gollum and the Ring====\n\nBilbo recounted his encounter with Gollum in full, but was cut short by Elrond before he could describe his entire journey to Erebor. Elrond then asked Frodo to recount his experience with the Ring since the day he received it. The others asked many questions as he did so, until all details were recounted and considered. Bilbo remarked to Frodo that they should some day discuss the story in private so that Bilbo could write it down in a book.\n\nFrodo was curious about Gandalf's absence during his journey from [[The Shire]] to Rivendell. Galdor joined Frodo in this inquiry and asked to know why the [[Wise]] were so sure about the Ring's identity, given the long span of time that had passed between its loss and supposed reappearance. He also asked about [[Saruman]]'s absence from the present council, wondering about the White Wizard's opinion on the matter at hand. Elrond called on Gandalf as the last speaker, to answer these questions.\n\nGandalf first pointed out that there is only one ring left that Sauron might still have been looking for, given that all of the others were either destroyed, in safe keeping, or in the hands of the [[Nazgûl]]. He also pointed out that Bilbo found his ring in the same year that Sauron (posing as the \"Necromancer\") was defeated at his fortress in [[Dol Guldur]] - a suspicious coincidence. Gandalf then revealed that Saruman had rejected the idea that the Ring would ever be found again - claiming it had rolled into the sea by now - and attempted to dissuade the other members of the [[White Council]] from taking any open actions against Sauron. This, Gandalf said, gave Sauron the chance to anticipate their actions and withdraw safely from Dol Guldur to Mordor, where he had already been at work building his strength. Saruman claimed that Sauron's belief that the Ring could still be found was an advantage for the White Council, as Sauron would waste effort trying to find it.\n\nLulled into inaction by Saruman's words, Gandalf set aside his worries about Bilbo's newfound ring; but doubt kept growing in him. Expecting Gollum to come out of his cave to seek the Ring, Gandalf did spot the creature; but when Gollum evaded him he decided to let the matter go, and did not discuss it with anyone for fear of stirring up needless trouble. However, when various spies began congregating around The Shire after Bilbo's birthday party, Gandalf consulted Aragorn, who convinced him to act on his suspicions and go hunting for Gollum together.\n\nGandalf and Aragorn found traces of Gollum near Mordor, but could not find the creature himself. Then Gandalf was reminded of Saruman's description of the One Ring:\n\n{{quote|The Nine, the Seven, and the Three had each their proper gem. Not so the One. It was round and unadorned, as it were one of the lesser rings; but its maker set marks upon it that the skilled, maybe, could still see and read.|[[Saruman]]'s description of the [[One Ring]], according to [[Gandalf]]}}\n\nNot knowing what those marks might be, Gandalf figured that the only way this information could've reached Saruman was through some account by Isildur - the only person other than Sauron ever known to have definitely held the One Ring. Therefore, Gandalf set out to Gondor, to study the Gondorian scrolls and archives. Denethor received him coldly, but allowed him to study the texts nevertheless.\n\nGandalf revealed that he had found a scroll written by Isildur himself after acquiring the Ring. Boromir confirmed that it is common knowledge in Gondor that Isildur returned to Minas Tirith first, and lived with Meneldil for a while before setting off north - at which time he could have written such an account. Gandalf recited from the scroll, where Isildur specifically stated that he was taking the Ring to the northern kingdom and wanted to leave an account of it in Gondor, so that future generations would not forget.\n\nAccording to the [[Scroll of Isildur]], the Ring had at first scorched Isildur's hand, but quickly cooled and shrank. Before it did, Isildur noted words inscribed into the Ring, which slowly faded over time. He could not read the inscription, which was written in the dark tongue of Mordor using Elvish script, but managed to copy it down before it disappeared. He surmised, correctly, that the script might re-appear if the Ring was ever reintroduced to a source of heat resembling Sauron's burning hand; but Isildur could not bring himself to do so, as the Ring was too valuable to him as an heirloom.\n\nUpon learning this, Gandalf immediately left Minas Tirith heading north. On his way, he received messages from [[Lothlórien]] that Aragorn had managed to capture Gollum. This prompted Aragorn to tell his account of the hunt for Gollum. He had made it to the Black Gate and the [[Morgul Vale]], but could not find Gollum. He despaired and turned homewards, but then found the creature's tracks by chance and followed it into the [[Dead Marshes]], where he finally caught Gollum peering into the water. Gollum bit Aragorn, but would tell him nothing. Gollum was then bound and gagged, and made to walk all the way back to Mirkwood, where he was handed off to the Wood Elves for imprisonment. Gandalf soon arrived, and interrogated the creature at length.\n\nGandalf confirmed to the Council that Gollum's story matched the one told by Bilbo just moments earlier. Furthermore, Gollum's interrogation revealed that he had found the Ring in the Great River, and had kept it for hundreds of years - far longer than the lifespan of his race. Gandalf noted that only the Great Rings have the power to extend life to such magnitude. Gandalf hoped that this information would put Galdor's doubts to rest regarding the identity of the Ring. Nevertheless, he recounted the text that Isildur had copied down from the ring, and announces that he had performed the test of fire upon it and confirmed the appearance of the same words. Gandalf then recited the part of the [[Ring Verse]] that appeared, causing a shadow to briefly pass over Rivendell and forcing some of the Elves to stop their ears.\n\nFinally, Gandalf revealed that Gollum had made it to Mordor, was captured and tortured there, and revealed all that he knew to Sauron. He surmised that Sauron has already figured out that the Ring is now in Rivendell. Boromir asked what punishment was inflicted on Gollum. Gandalf said that Gollum had already suffered enough on account of the Ring and the torture in Mordor, and so was left as a prisoner in Mirkwood. He noted that Gollum was capable of much greater feats than his emaciated form might suggest on account of his burning desire for the Ring, and suspected that Gollum was released from Mordor's clutches in order to perform some unknown, nefarious task.\n\nLegolas joined the conversation for the first time, with alarming news. He was sent to Rivendell from Mirkwood to report that Gollum had escaped their prison. He said that, having learned of Gollum's sad story and heeded Gandalf's hopes that he might still be cured of his condition, the Elves took pity on the creature and moved him out of the dungeons. Glóin grumbled that he and [[Thorin and Company|Thorin's Company]] did not receive such tender mercy during their stay in the Elves' dungeon, forcing Gandalf to interject in order to prevent a quarrel about past grievances.\n\nLegolas continued, describing Gollum's escape. He was taken out for a walk in the forest, and allowed to climb a tall tree he was fond of; however, that day he refused to come down for many hours. The Elves stood guard at the bottom of the tree, but at night were suddenly attacked by a large group of Orcs from the mountains. When the Orcs were finally driven off, Gollum's guards were found slain, and he was gone. The Elves surmised that Gollum was somehow aware that the attack was going to occur that day, perhaps through one of Sauron's spies.\n\nAccording to Legolas, the Elves began searching for Gollum immediately, and found his tracks among those of a large group of Orcs. Unfortunately, the tracks soon disappeared in the vicinity of Dol Guldur, and the Elves were reluctant to keep searching in that direction. He explained that Mirkwood had once again become full of the evil creatures that had previously been driven out after the [[Attack on Dol Guldur]]. Gandalf expressed frustration, but said that Gollum will now play whatever part was destined to him - hopefully one that Sauron has not foreseen.\n\n====Of the disappearance of Gandalf====\n\nFinally, Gandalf came to the story of his own disappearance. In June he had left [[Hobbiton]] for the southern edge of The Shire, where he received news of Mordor's invasion of Ithilien. Hurrying east to [[Bree]], he ran into [[Radagast the Brown]], a fellow [[Wizard]], who had been seeking him. Radagast reported to Gandalf that Nazgûl had been sighted crossing the Great River in secret, on their way westwards, disguised as riders in black. According to Radagast, the Nazgûl had been asking anyone they came across about a land called \"Shire\". Radagast added that Saruman had sent him on this errand, offering to help if Gandalf wished it. Gandalf hoped that Saruman, who was wise in the ways of the Enemy, had found some weapon to help drive the Nazgûl away. Before Radagast could ride off, Gandalf asked him to have beasts and birds collect information and deliver it directly to [[Orthanc]].\n\nGandalf stayed that night in Bree, where he decided to ride to [[Isengard]] instead of back to the Shire. He wrote a message to Frodo and left it with his friend [[Barliman Butterbur]] at the [[Prancing Pony]]. He then rode south along the [[Misty Mountains]] to the [[Gap of Rohan]]. Gandalf described Isengard as a circle of sheer rock enclosing a valley at the southern edge of the Misty Mountains, with a lone tower at its center. As he rode through the heavily-defended gate in the rocky wall, he felt an unexplained trepidation. Reaching the tower, he was greeted by Saruman who was was wearing a ring on his finger, and let inside.\n\nGandalf asked Saruman for aid, but received only condescension in return. Saruman facetiously wondered what brought Gandalf out of The Shire, indicating that he knew Gandalf was keeping some very important secret from him. When Gandalf reported what he had heard from Radagast, Saruman insulted Radagast and revealed that he was only sent to lure Gandalf to Orthanc. Gandalf then noticed that Saruman was wearing a robe of many colors.\n\nSaruman offered Gandalf a choice. Claiming that the time of the Elves was over, and that the time of Men was beginning, Saruman suggested that the Wizards should be the ones to rule in this new age. For this, he said, they needed to align themselves with the rising power of Middle Earth.\n\n{{quote|A new Power is rising. Against it the old allies and policies will not avail us at all. There is no hope left in Elves or dying Númenor. This then is one choice before you, before us. We may join with that Power. It would be wise, Gandalf. There is hope that way. Its victory is at hand; and there will be rich reward for those that aided it.|[[Saruman]]}}\n\nSaruman then revealed that he had already figured out that Gandalf had been protecting the One Ring in The Shire. He pressed Gandalf to reveal its whereabouts. Gandalf refused to reveal anything, realizing that Saruman and Sauron were now simply two sides of the same coin.\n\nGandalf was taken to the Pinnacle of Orthanc, where he saw that the once-green valley of Isengard was now filled with pits and forges. Saruman has been mustering an army of Orcs and Wolves, which Gandalf surmised would be used in rivalry to Sauron rather than at his service. He could not escape the tower, and was forced to spend his days in the cold and the smoke billowing from below. Frodo exclaims that he had seen this event in one of his dreams during his journey.\n\nGandalf's salvation came thanks to the incorruptible Radagast, who had fortunately merely played the part of an unwitting pawn in Saruman's plans. Radagast did as Gandalf asked, riding east to seek allies. Eventually, he found the [[Great Eagles]], who began to scout the lands around the Misty Mountains and learned of the coming of the Nazgûl and of Gollum's escape from Mirkwood. [[Gwaihir]], fastest of the Great Eagles, came to Isengard to deliver this news, only to find Gandalf at the top of the tower and bear him away from there before Saruman could intervene.\n\nGwaihir could not take Gandalf very far, so Gandalf decided to be taken to nearby [[Rohan]] where he could acquire a fast horse for the journey back north. Gwaihir assured him that while Rohan had been sending horses as tribute to [[Mordor]], they had not yet allied with the Dark Lord. At [[Edoras]], Gandalf discovered that Saruman's lies had already taken hold, and he was received very coldly. The king ordered him to take a horse and be gone, so Gandalf chose the best steed in the land and rode off.\n\nAragorn lamented this state of affairs in the land of Rohan, but Boromir stood up in their defence, claiming that the [[Rohirrim]] are honourable men and would never give away their beloved horses as tribute. Gandalf agreed, adding that the horse he had chosen was indeed one of their most precious horses: [[Shadowfax]], born in the early days of the world; a horse too fast even for Nazgûl horses to catch, never before ridden by any man. He said that Shadowfax bore him from Rohan all the way to The Shire in the time it took Frodo to reach the [[Barrow-downs]]. Nevertheless, Gandalf could not catch up with the Nazgûl, who were already well ahead of him.\n\nGandalf reached Hobbiton and had words with [[Gaffer Gamgee]], discovering that Frodo had already left less than a week earlier, and that Black Riders had come looking for him the same night. Gandalf rode on to [[Buckland]] and found it in uproar after the Nazgûl attack on [[Crickhollow]]. At the house, he found Frodo's cape (left there by [[Fatty Bolger]]) and thought the worst had happened. He tracked two Nazgûl to Bree, where he met with Barliman Butterbur. The innkeeper broke down immediately, apologizing for letting the Hobbits continue on with Strider, not realizing that Gandalf had hoped this would happen. Overjoyed at the knowledge that the Hobbits were not captured and were now with Aragorn, Gandalf rested a night at the Prancing Pony. That night, five Black Riders stormed right through Bree, heading east. Gandalf surmised that the Black Riders had made a tactical error in splitting their forces to attack Hobbiton and Buckland, leaving the way open to the east for a short time, accidentally letting the Hobbits and Strider through.\n\nGandalf rode after the Nazgûl in the morning, and intercepted them at Weathertop. The Nazgûl waited for nightfall, and finally attacked. The battle raged through the night, and at sunrise Gandalf escaped to the north, drawing four of the riders away for a while, though they eventually gave up and turned back. Unable to do anything more to help, Gandalf navigated his way across country to Rivendell, and eventually released Shadowfax partway there. He says that he had become good friends with the horse, and that Shadowfax would return to his aid, if he ever called. He finally reached Rivendell only three days before Frodo.\n\n===The Council decides===\nWith all the stories told, Elrond expressed his dismay at the fall of Saruman, who had been their trusted counsel. However, he also expressed great marvel at the resilience of the Hobbits during their journey, and that he found Frodo's story most interesting. He noted, in particular, that he had forgotten all about [[Tom Bombadil]], whom he calls Iarwain Ben-adar, \"oldest and fatherless\". He lamented not having invited Bombadil to the council, but Gandalf said he would not have come.\n\nErestor asked whether it would not be wise to give the Ring to Bombadil, on whom it has no effect. Gandalf explained that while Bombadil might agree, he would not understand the importance of the task, and might even lose the Ring eventually. In any case, Gandalf asserted, even Bombadil in his own little realm could not stand up to the full power of Sauron. Glorfindel added that taking the Ring to Bombadil in secret would also be impossible now.\n\nGaldor agreed with this assessment, claiming that any hope remaining was now here at Rivendell, or at the Grey Havens, or in Lothlórien. Elrond responded that neither he nor those other Elven lands had the power to endure the coming storm. Glorfindel concluded that there were only two options remaining: send the Ring west over the sea, or destroy it. Elrond countered both options: for one, the Ring cannot be destroyed by any means they possess; and second, the people of Valinor would not accept the Ring into their care,  being an evil belonging to Middle-Earth and thus a problem that the people of Middle-Earth must solve for themselves.\n\nGlorfindel then suggested throwing the Ring into the sea, subverting and fulfilling the lie that Saruman had told them about it. Gandalf countered this by saying that vile creatures in the deep might find and retrieve it, or that the seas might one day shift and bring it back to the surface. He was adamant that a permanent end to the problem must be found. Galdor again agreed, adding that it would be extremely difficult to get the Ring to the sea anyway, with the Enemy still watching the roads there. He asserted that the Nazgûl would soon return with faster riding beasts, and would be expecting the Ring to travel west. He doubted the ability of Gondor to keep the forces of Sauron at bay much longer, and they would eventually break through and come straight for the Grey Havens. Boromir defended his people, saying they still had the strength to fight, but Galdor noted that the Black Riders might bypass Gondor altogether.\n\nErestor concluded that Glorfindel's earlier assessment was correct: either they hide the Ring, or find a way to destroy it. Elrond finally spoke, agreeing that the roads to the west are predictable and must be shunned. Therefore, they must go east, to Mordor, to destroy the Ring where it was made.\n\nBoromir interjected, offering a third option: to use the Ring as a weapon, just as Saruman had planned to do for his own ends. Elrond stated that the Ring cannot be used, as it is wholly evil and obeys only the Dark Lord who made it. He reminded Boromir of Saruman's corruption as an example of a once-benevolent and powerful figure consumed by desire for the Ring. He said that even Sauron was not evil in the beginning, and that if any of the Wise were to take the Ring for themselves, they would simply replace him and become evil rulers themselves. He refused to take the Ring, even to hide it, as too did  does Gandalf.\n\nBoromir was dismayed, but expressed some hope that the Sword that was Broken might still come to Gondor's aid, if Aragorn proves to be made of the same mettle as his ancestors. He also expressed a hope that others would fight as valiantly as his people do, which Elrond reassured him they would.\n\nGlóin suggested pooling the capabilities and powers of the disparate kingdoms, suggesting the other Rings of Power be used to aid them in the coming conflict. He noted that one Dwarf-ring - [[Ring of Thrór|Thrór's ring]] - might still be found in Moria, and that perhaps Balin had already found it there. Gandalf reported that this was impossible, as Saruman had taken that ring from [[Thrór]]'s heir [[Thráin]] during his torture at Dol Guldur. Glóin asked about the Elven-rings, but Elrond dismissed the question offhand; the Three Rings were made without Sauron's involvement and would serve no purpose as weapons. He added that if Sauron was ever to regain the One Ring, anything that was gained by the Three would be subverted and ruined anyway. He remarked that this was Sauron's plan all along, and lamented that the Three Rings had been created at all.\n\nGlóin asked what would happen if the One Ring were destroyed. Elrond responded that no one knew, but hoped that the Three would become free in that case, though they might lose all their power. Glorfindel remarked that the Elves were willing to take that risk, if it meant ridding Middle-Earth of the threat of Sauron.\n\nThe conversation returned to the matter of destroying the Ring. Erestor commented that there was little chance of reaching the Fire where the Ring could be destroyed, calling the idea a \"folly\". Gandalf retorted that this might actually be an advantage: Sauron understood only the desire for power, and expected anyone who came across the Ring to use it; he could not understand a desire to destroy it. As such, the attempt to destroy it might catch him off-guard, at least for a while. Elrond agreed with this assessment, adding:\n\n{{quote|This quest may be attempted by the weak with as much hope as the strong. Yet such is oft the course of deeds that move the wheels of the world: small hands do them because they must, while the eyes of the great are elsewhere.|[[Elrond]]}}\n\nAt this, Bilbo stood to confirm he had received the hint, and volunteered to take the Ring to Mordor himself. He lamented only that he might not get the chance to write the ending to his book, which would have to be amended because he might not \"live happily ever after to the end of his days\". Boromir was amused by this, but quickly realized that all others present regarded Bilbo's offer with great respect. Gandalf thanked Bilbo for his bravery, but said that Bilbo's part in the story had ended when he passed on the Ring, other than to record the events in a sequel book when the party chosen to take the Ring eventually returned.\n\nBilbo asked who those chosen for the task would be. Silence fell on the council as they pondered the question with heavy hearts. Frodo slowly came to the realization that the course of events he had dreaded was now inevitable. With great difficulty, and a sense of the influence of another, he finally spoke:\n\n{{quote|I will take the Ring, though I do not know the way.|[[Frodo Baggins]]}}\n\nRealizing the implications, Elrond told Frodo that the task may have been appointed for him, and that he might be the only one able to find the way. He pondered this unlikely turn of events, which none of the Wise had foreseen. He told Frodo that the decision was his alone, but that if he chose to go he would be counted among the greatest Elf-friends who ever lived, among the likes of [[Hador]], [[Húrin]], [[Túrin]] and [[Beren]].\n\nSuddenly, Sam leapt up from where had been observing the Council, protesting that Frodo must not be sent on this quest alone.\n\n{{quote|No indeed! You at least shall go with him. It is hardly possible to separate you from him, even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not.|[[Elrond]]}}\n\nAt this, Sam sank to the floor in embarrassment, realizing the situation he and Frodo had put themselves in.\n\n==Composition==\nEarly drafts of the chapter probably were completed near the end of [[1939]]); in that version, the original Fellowship consisted of Gandalf, Boromir, and five Hobbits including \"[[Trotter|Peregrin Boffin]]\".<ref>{{CG|CG}}, p. xxii</ref>\n\nLater drafts of the chapter were reworked around [[1940]]-[[1941]], with at least three new versions.
