This change was introduced in the time of [[Isengrim Took II]] ({{SR|1083}} - {{SR|1122|n}}).\n\nHobbits considered that the shifting of weekday names in relation to dates from year to year was untidy and inconvenient, so they arranged that [[Mid-year's Day]] (and the [[Overlithe]] in leap years) had no weekday name; this ensured that all dates in all years always fell upon the same weekdays. As the Shire Calendar was now perennial, Hobbits no longer needed or bothered to put the weekday in their letters or diaries.\n\nOne minor consequence of the Shire-reform was that no month ever began on a Friday.  This led to the jest in the [[Shire]] of speaking of \"on Friday the first\" when referring to a day that did not exist, or a day upon which very unlikely events would occur.  The full expression of this idiom was \"on Friday the first of [[Summerfilth]]\".\n\nThe [[Bree Calendar]] also adopted the reform.<ref>{{App|Calendars}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Hobbit Calendar]]\n[[fi:Konnunuudistus]]"}}}
