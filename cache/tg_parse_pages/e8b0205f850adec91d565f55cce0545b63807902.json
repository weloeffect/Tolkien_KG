Anderson comments that \"''Tolkien's affiliation with the Newman Society was previously undocumented''\", and finds it noteworthy that Tolkien during his busy 1940s managed to \"''volunteer work for the Association devoted to John Henry Newman, founder of the [[Birmingham]] Oratory where Tolkien himself had been educated as a boy''\".<ref>[[Douglas A.
