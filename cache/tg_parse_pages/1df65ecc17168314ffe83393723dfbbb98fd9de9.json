The only way to cross the river is through a guarded ford, which also transitions the player between the [[Rhovanion]] to the [[Gondor]] in-game landmasses, a transition very noticeable because all of Gondor is covered under the [[Dawnless Day]] at that time, regardless of the daylight conditions on the Rohan side. A Rohirrim town of \"Beaconwatch\" sits on the bank of the river, with a clear view across into the [[Firien Wood]] and [[Halifirien]].\n\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Rivers of Rohan]]\n[[Category:Streams]]\n[[de:Mering-Strom]]\n[[fi:Mering]]\n__NOTOC__"}}}
