Whether they are true elephants or not is somewhat unclear.\n \n==Characteristics==\nOliphaunts lived in [[Near Harad|Near]] or [[Far Harad|Far]] [[Harad]], south of [[Mordor]],<ref>{{webcite|website=TS|articleurl=https://www.tolkiensociety.org/app/uploads/2015/11/transcribed-map.jpg|articlename=Tolkien’s annotated map of Middle-earth transcribed|dated=10 November 2015|accessed=26 September 2022}}</ref> where the [[Haradrim]] called them '''''Mûmakil'''''.<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, entry '''mûmak''', p. 88</ref> Massive, often ferocious beasts, their legs were like trees, their bodies were larger than a house, they had enormous sail-like ears, and they had a long snout like a huge serpent.<ref name=Herbs>{{TT|Herbs}}, pp. 661-662</ref> Somehow the Haradrim tamed them and the result was possibly the most brutally effective beast of war that Middle-earth ever saw.\n \nThe Haradrim strapped towers on the backs of these beasts and rode on them into battle. The ''mûmak'' itself, enraged and goaded by its cruel Haradrim masters, would charge through the enemy, trampling archer, swordsman and horse beneath its massive feet.<ref name=Herbs/>\n \nKilling a ''mûmak'' was almost impossible - its rough, leathery hide made arrows relatively harmless.<ref name=Herbs/> Horses had a natural fear of the ''mûmakil'' so even the most skilled horsemen could not get close enough to strike at its great, trunk-like legs. The only known way to defeat an oliphaunt was to shoot it in the eye, which typically meant standing in front of it as it charged the archer, and thus a very difficult task to perform.<ref name=Battle>{{RK|Battle}}, pp. 843, 846 and 849</ref>\n\n==History==\nDue to their habitation in the far south, oliphaunts were creatures of legend to the inhabitants of the [[Westlands]].  The [[Hobbits]] had an old [[Oliphaunt|poem]] about oliphaunts,<ref>{{AB|Preface}}</ref> which [[Samwise Gamgee]] recited to [[Gollum]] in [[Ithilien]].<ref name=Gate>{{TT|Gate}}, p. 646</ref>\n \nOn [[7 March]] {{TA|3019}}<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019, March 7, p. 1093</ref> [[Faramir]] led the [[Rangers of Ithilien]] on an ambush against a contingent of Haradrim marching north. This battle was witnessed by [[Frodo Baggins]] and Sam, and they saw an oliphaunt in full charge. The maddened animal had smashed its war-tower in its rush through the woods; unguided it trampled soldiers of both sides until it disappeared from view.<ref name=Herbs/>\n \nDuring the [[Siege of Gondor]], beginning on [[14 March]],<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019, March 14, p. 1093</ref> oliphaunts were used to drag war towers and engines to be used against the walls of [[Minas Tirith]].<ref>{{RK|Siege}}, p. 828</ref> On [[15 March]],<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019, March 15, p. 1093</ref> in the subsequent [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], oliphaunts were used as rallying points for the Haradrim after the [[Rohirrim]] had charged into the fray. Eventually the great beasts were defeated as the forces of the West won the battle, but both [[Derufin]] and [[Duilin (son of Duinhir)|Duilin]], the sons of [[Duinhir]] of [[Morthond]] were trampled when they led their archers to shoot at the eyes of the oliphaunts.<ref name=Battle/>\n \nAfter the defeat of Sauron when Frodo and Sam had been rescued and brought to the [[Field of Cormallen]], Sam wandered in the glades near [[Henneth Annûn]], hoping to see the oliphaunt he had seen before, but to no avail.<ref>{{RK|Cormallen}}, p. 957</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word '''''oliphaunt''''' was an archaic form of the word ''elephant'' used as a rusticism in the [[Shire]].<ref name=Nomenclature>{{HM|N}}, p. 761 and p. 460</ref> It was used by [[Sam]] and [[Frodo]]<ref name=Gate/> and by [[Bilbo]].<ref>{{RK|Partings}}, p. 987</ref>\n\nThe english word ''oliphant'' is derived from Old French ''olifant''. The ''o'' is probably derived from [[Old English]] ''olfend'' (\"elephant\") or from Old High German ''olbenta'' (\"camel\").<ref name=Nomenclature/>\n\nOliphant/olifant/olifaunt had been archaic words for elephant and their ivory. The most famous use of the oliphant (as in horn) is in ''[[wikipedia:The Song of Roland|The Song of Roland]]'' \"The oliphant is set to Roland's Lips\"; Roland fails to call for help at the Battle of Roncevaux in 778 until it is too late for him and his comrades.\n \n[[Gandalf]] mentions elephants once in ''[[The Hobbit]]'',<ref>{{H|2}}</ref> so perhaps \"oliphaunt\" is a [[Hobbitish]] corruption of this original word. But whether these two creatures are the same cannot be said with certainty.\n\n==Other names==\nThe name '''''mûmak''''' (plural '''''mûmakil''''') was a name in a language of the Men of Harad for a great elephant.<ref name=PE17/> This name and its plural were also used by the [[Men]] of [[Gondor]].<ref name=Herbs/>\n\nIn [[Sindarin]], the word for elephant was '''''annabon''''', and in [[Quenya]] '''''andamunda''''', both terms meant \"long-snout\".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry \"MBUD'\"</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nA draft version of what would later become [[Appendix F]] mentions that the name ''mûmak'' of the great elephant of the Harad is a name from the speech of Men of the East and allies of Sauron.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, typescript F4, p. 79</ref>\n\n==Portrayals in adaptations==\n'''1968: [[The Hobbit (1968 radio series)|''The Hobbit'' (1968 radio series)]]:'''\n:Gandalf's line \"Great elephants!\" was replaced by \"Great oliphaunts\"; this was one of several uses of material from ''The Lord of the Rings''.\n\n'''1980: [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]:'''\n:[[File:Mumakil.jpg|thumb|Oliphaunts as portrayed in Peter Jackson's ''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy.]]The oliphaunts are depicted as large wooly mammoth-like creatures and are the beasts that pull [[Grond (battering ram)|Grond]] into position.\n\n'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''\n:Two oliphaunts appear in the ambush in [[Ithilien]]. They are CGI-created, and they are significantly larger than today's elephants. They have rather elongated skulls compared to real-life elephants, which is likely based on ''Gomphotherium'', an extinct relative of elephants. Their tusks consist of a long pair of maxillary tusks growing downwards and curving up at the top (not unlike mammoths), a pair of shorter mandibular tusks (again, like in ''Gomphotherium'') and a very small pair of tusks growing from the cheekbones. They have small ears, an arching back and long limbs.\n:They are seen mounted with war harnesses, carrying at least a dozen Haradrim. When they're attacked by Gondorians, they panic and flee, but none of them are seen to be killed in the attack.\n\n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''\n:Oliphaunts are used in the scenes from the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields|Battle of Pelennor Fields]], mounted with towers and decorated with red war paint and deadly spikes on their multiple tusks. Otherwise, their appearance is unaltered from the previous film. The [[Rohirrim]] charge headlong into battle, and even pass under them. Later in the battle, [[Legolas]] shoots down an oliphaunt. Several oliphaunts were killed during the battle. \n\n:[[Weta Workshop|Weta]] made a large slain prop ''mûmak'' at almost the last minute, much to Weta staff's consternation, on request by the director [[Peter Jackson]]. It appears in the scene where [[Peregrin Took]] enters the field and locates the dazed and disoriented [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] after his experience with [[Éowyn]] in successfully slaying the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]]. The prop became a favourite picnic destination for crew members.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Mumak.jpg|thumb|left|A mûmak in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'', with [[Minas Tirith]] in background]]\n'''2015: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':''' \n:The Mûmakil originate in [[Far Harad]], where they are bred and trained for battle by the [[Haradrim]]. The specimens brought to the [[Pelennor Fields]] are at least 12-15 meters tall, much larger than the mammoths found in the cold northern regions of [[Middle-earth]] in the game. When the players finally reach [[Harad]] themselves, the mûmakil they encounter are much smaller than the ones they've previously seen, comparable in size to real life mammoths and elephants. It is explained that the Haradrim have taken all of the adults that they could find to the war, and that the only ones left behind are the juveniles. \n\n{{references}}\n[[de:Mûmakil]]\n[[fr:encyclo:biologie:faune:mumakil]]\n[[fi:Olifantit]]\n[[Category:Animals]]\n[[Category:Mannish words]]\n[[Category:Servants of Sauron]]\n[[Category:Westron words]]"}}}
