The lake was formed by a narrow southern outlet and the small island of [[Tol Brandir]], which created a natural dam.<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref> Upon the lake's northern approach from Anduin the [[Men]] of [[Gondor]] carved the huge pillars of the [[Argonath]] in the reign of [[Rómendacil II]] to mark the northern boundary of their realm,<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref> although by the time of the [[War of the Ring]] that boundary has long since receded. At the southern end of the lake stood three steep hills. [[Amon Hen]], the \"Hill of Seeing\", was upon the western shore and [[Amon Lhaw]], the \"Hill of Hearing\", was upon the east. The third hill formed the island of [[Tol Brandir]]. None ever set foot upon the island due to its sheer cliffs that rose directly from the river.<ref name=\"Break\">{{FR|II10}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe [[Fellowship of the Ring]] arrived at Nen Hithoel on [[25 February]], {{TA|3019}},<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> and made camp at [[Parth Galen]] close to Amon Hen. The fall of [[Boromir]] and the breaking of the Fellowship occurred soon after. [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] took a boat for the eastern shore skirting the southern edge of Tol Brandir,<ref name=\"Break\"/> [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] were captured by [[Orcs]],<ref>{{TT|III3}}</ref> and after sending Boromir's body over the falls in another boat, [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]] and [[Gimli]], calling themselves the ''[[Three Hunters]]'', set out to track the Orcs and find the captive [[Hobbits]].<ref>{{TT|III1}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Nen Hithoel'' is [[Sindarin]] for \"Mist-cool Water\", from ''[[nen]]'' (\"water\") + ''[[hîth]]'' (\"mist\") + ''oel'' (\"cool\").<ref name=\"Index\">{{HM|UI}}, pp. 327-328</ref> Note that the ([[Noldorin]]) word ''[[oel]]'' appeared in the earlier ''Etymologies'' of the 1930s with the meaning \"pool, lake\", but this word had changed to (Sindarin) ''[[ael]]'' by the time that ''The Lord of the Rings'' was written, and therefore could not have been an element of the name ''Nen Hithoel''. Compare, for example, ''[[Aelin-uial]]'' with its earlier form ''Oelin-uial''.{{fact}}\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Nen Hithoel.jpg|thumb|250px|Nen Hithoel in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2012: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The only the western shore of Nen Hithoel is accessible in the game.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Gondor]]\n[[Category:Lakes]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[de:Nen Hithoel]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/eaux/rhovanion/nen hithoel]]\n[[fi:Nen Hithoel]]"}}}
