Morwen was invented by [[Warner Bros.]] for [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]], where she was portrayed by [[Robyn Malcolm]].\n\n==History==\nMorwen was the mother of [[Freda]] and [[Éothain (film character)|Éothain]],  whom she sent to alert [[Théoden]] that the [[Dunlendings|Wild Men]] were pillaging through [[Rohan]]. Her children were kept at [[Edoras]] until Théoden led his people to shelter at [[Helm's Deep]], where the children were reunited with their mother.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name [[Morwen]] is unusual for the [[Rohirrim]], being [[Sindarin]] and not [[Old English]]. Movie producers reasoned that this Elvish name would become popular in Rohan after the coming of [[Morwen Steelsheen]], the [[Gondor]]ian queen consort of King [[Thengel]].\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{title}}\n\n[[Category:Men from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings (film series) characters]]"}}}
