Additionally, the forests of ''[[Brethil]]'' and ''[[Nan Elmoth]]'' were held as part of Doriath, but these last two lay outside the Girdle of Melian.\n\n==History==\n===Early days===\nBefore its foundation, during the [[Great March]], the [[Noldor]] made their dwellings in the forests of [[Neldoreth]] and [[Region]] that would become Doriath, on their way westward. That time the [[Teleri]] were still back in the [[East Beleriand]]; their leader, [[Elwë]], often went through to the forests to seek his friend [[Finwë]].<ref>{{S|4}}</ref>\n\nOne of those times Elwë was lost in [[Nan Elmoth]], and when [[Ulmo]] returned for them a part remained behind. They became known as the Sindar or Grey Elves, and when Thingol returned he became their king, ruling from Doriath.\n\nAs Melian foresaw that war was coming to Beleriand, she adviced Thingol to become an ally of the [[Dwarves of Belegost]], who carved the caverns of [[Menegroth]] for him, that became the capital of the realm.<ref name=\"Sindar\"/> In those years, [[Eöl]] the Dark Elf leased [[Nan Elmoth]] from Thingol, having paid the sword [[Anglachel]] for it.<ref>{{S|16}}</ref>\n\nIn {{YT|1497}}, after the [[First Battle]] of Beleriand, many [[Green-elves|Laiquendi]] removed to Doriath.<ref name=\"Sindar\"/> After this, Doriath was encircled by the [[Girdle of Melian]], an impenetrable fence of enchantment that guarded the kingdom.<ref name=\"Sindar\">{{S|Sindar}}</ref> '''''[[Doriath#Etymology and names|Eglador]]''''' was the name of the land of Doriath before it was protected by the [[Girdle of Melian]]. Even beyond the limits of the Girdle, [[Thingol]] was seen by all the native Elves of [[Beleriand]], from the [[Gelion]] to [[Belegaer]], as their lord;<ref name=\"Sindar\"/> he was even acknowledged as high-king of all the [[Teleri]] in [[Beleriand]].<ref name=\"LastWritingsN\">{{PM|Last}}</ref>\n\n===End of the First Age===\n[[File:Elena Kukanova - Doriath - Beleg and young Turin.jpg|200px|thumb|''Doriath - Beleg and young Túrin'' by [[Elena Kukanova]]]]\nWhile Thingol's own kingdom was protected by the power of [[Melian]] the [[Maia]], he was still loath to surrender any other lands in Beleriand to the Noldor due to his suspicions of the aggressive new lords in Middle-earth.<ref name=\"Return\">{{S|Return}}</ref> On a time [[Finrod]] and his sister [[Galadriel]] were guests of King Elu Thingol, their kinsman in Doriath. There, Queen Melian questioned Galadriel on how and why the Noldor had returned, upon which Galadriel told her only some of the story. Therefore she was the first to glean the truth, perceiving more than Galadriel was willing to tell, and she warned Thingol against dealing with the sons of Fëanor. Later, while Finrod, Angrod and Aegnor were visiting Galadriel, Thingol had learned the truth about the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë]] and accused them of deceiving him for hiding their misdeeds against his kin. Angrod spoke out in anger, pointing out the grievous wrongs they endured as well. This led directly to Thingol banning the use of [[Quenya]] in his lands, which led to [[Sindarin]] being the common Elven tongue in Middle-earth. However, the descendants of Finarfin were not expelled from Doriath as they were of Thingol's kin from [[Olwë]], his brother, but also because he showed a sympathy to both the Houses of Finarfin and Fingolfin for the wrongs they had suffered. Nevertheless, as King Thingol's relations with the Noldor were already strained even before he learned of the [[First Kinslaying]], he refused to aid them in the war against Morgoth, and took little part in the ongoing struggle.<ref>{{S|Noldor}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Men]] arrived in Beleriand, they were refused entry into Doriath; however, at [[Finrod]]'s request, the [[Haladin]] were allowed to live in [[Brethil]].\n\nIn {{FA|455|n}} Morgoth issued a [[Dagor Bragollach|great assault]] which broke the [[Siege of Angband]] and burst into both [[West Beleriand]] and [[East Beleriand]]. In {{FA|462|n}}, Morgoth's eastern army was broken by Thingol on the borders of Doriath.<ref>{{GA|170}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Anke Eißmann - The hunting-party I.jpg|thumb|''The hunting-party'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]\n[[Beren]], son of [[Barahir]] and lord of the [[House of Bëor]], passed through the Girdle as Melian had foretold, and arrived in Neldoreth. There Thingol's daughter Lúthien fell in love with him. After the Quest for the [[Silmarils|Silmaril]], the Wolf [[Carcharoth]] also breached the Girdle, causing much destruction in north Doriath. But in the [[Hunting of the Wolf]], Thingol, Beren, and Thingol's captains [[Beleg]] and [[Mablung]] hunted and killed the beast.<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>\n\n[[Túrin]] was sent to Doriath, and lived there until he came of age, when he fled from the land. Later his mother and sister, [[Morwen]] and [[Nienor]] lived there, until they were lost.\n\nIn {{FA|502}}, some time after Túrin's tragic death, [[Húrin]], Túrin's father and now an old man, was allowed to enter Menegroth, where in anger he threw the [[Nauglamír]], the treasure of [[Nargothrond]] before King Thingol and \"thanked\" him for aiding his son. Melian pierced through Húrin's madness and grief; shamed by his actions, he offered the Nauglamír to Thingol sincerely and left Menegroth a broken man.<ref name=\"Doriath\">{{S|Doriath}}</ref>\n\n===Ruin of Doriath===\n[[File:Pete Amachree - Ruins of Doriath.jpg|thumb|300px|''Ruins of Doriath'' by [[:Category:Images by Pete Amachree|Pete Amachree]]]]\nAt that time a desire came into Thingol's heart to take the Nauglamír and place the Silmaril in it, thus melding together two of the greatest creations made by the Elves and the [[Dwarves]]. He hired some [[Dwarves of Nogrod|Dwarven craftsmen]] to do it for him. But by the time the Dwarves were finished they had become obsessed with the Nauglamír and asked for it as a payment for their labour. This infuriated Thingol realizing they were coveting the Silmaril. The Dwarves were angered by his harsh words, and killed him. This led to a [[battle in the Thousand Caves]] in the year {{FA|503}} and the eventual [[Second Kinslaying|destruction of Doriath]], which scattered its people.<ref name=\"Doriath\"/>\n\nIn {{FA|503}}, Doriath was briefly restored under Beren and Lúthien's son [[Dior|Dior Eluchíl]].<ref name=\"Doriath\"/> Learning that the [[Silmaril]] is in Doriath, the [[Sons of Fëanor]] sent message to [[Dior]] requesting the return of the Silmaril. Dior does not answer.<ref>{{WJ|Years}}, p. 351</ref> Thus, in {{FA|506}}, Dior was attacked and killed by the [[Sons of Fëanor]], along with their followers. They assaulted Doriath with a surprise attack, in the middle of winter, and fought with Dior in the [[Menegroth|Thousand Caves]]. This was the Second Slaying of Elf by Elf. In that battle, Dior slew [[Celegorm]]. [[Curufin]] and [[Caranthir]] also fell. Dior was also slain along with his wife Nimloth. [[Eluréd]] and [[Elurín]] were seized, taken into the forest, and left to starve by the cruel servants of Celegorm.<ref name=\"Doriath\"/> Maedhros repented of this act of vengeance and cruelty against the children, and he long sought for them in the woods, but \"his search was unavailing,\" and the fate of Dior's sons is not known.<ref name=\"Doriath\"/> By {{FA|507}}, Doriath was utterly destroyed following the [[Second Kinslaying]].<ref name=\"Doriath\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Doriath.mp3|Ardamir}}\n''Doriath'' is a [[Sindarin]] name meaning \"Land of the Fence\"<ref name=silmindex>{{S|Index}}</ref><ref name=WJ/> or \"Land of the [[Girdle of Melian|Girdle]]\".<ref name=Sindar /> The name consists of the elements ''[[dôr]]'' (\"land\") + ''[[iâth]]'' (\"fence\").<ref name=WJ>{{WJ|Quendi}}, pp. 370, 378</ref>\n\n==Other names==\nThe earlier name of Doriath, '''''Eglador''''', probably means either \"Land of the [[Eglath|Forsaken]]\"<ref name=silmindex/> or \"Land of the [[Elves]]\" in [[Ilkorin]].<ref>{{LR|P3}}, entries \"[[AR]]\", \"ELED\", \"GAT(H)\"</ref>\n\nThe [[Quenya]] name is '''''Lestanórë''''', also meaning \"Land of the Girdle\".<ref>{{WJ|A}}, p. 369</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n'''''Artanor''''' (\"The Land Beyond\") was in early versions of the [[legendarium]] the name for what was later called Doriath.<ref>{{LT2|Appendix}}, entry \"Artanor\"</ref>\n{{references}}\n{{kinslayings}}\n[[Category:Beleriand]]\n[[Category:Doriath| ]]\n[[Category:Elven realms]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n\n[[de:Doriath]]\n[[fi:Doriath]]\n[[fr:encyclo:geographie:royaumes:doriath]]"}}}
