It was used to describe a concept similar to the ideas of \"hope\" or \"optimism\". ''Amdir'' is more closely defined in the ''[[Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth]]'' as \"an expectation of good, which though uncertain has some foundation in what is known\". ''Amdir'' was often contrasted with ''[[Estel]]'', which is a more deeply grounded type of hope.<ref>{{MR|P4c}}</ref>\n{{references}}\n{{title|lowercase}}\n[[Category:Concepts]]\n[[Category:Sindarin nouns]]"}}}
