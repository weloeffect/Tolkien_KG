After a continuous retreat from the [[Great Gates|East-gate]] and [[First Hall]], then the [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm]] and [[Second Hall]], the remaining [[Durin's Folk|Longbeards]] were forced all the way back into the [[Twenty-first Hall]].<ref name=\"Bridge\"/>\nAfter an unsuccessful attempt to escape through the [[Doors of Durin]] that saw the death of [[Óin]], the Chamber of Mazarbul became the last hold-out of the colony after losing the Twenty-first Hall just outside chamber. Barring the gates, [[Ori]] and the few survivors set up a final defence.<ref name=\"Bridge\"/>\n\n==Opposing Forces==\nOf the Dwarves there were very few. Four were all that returned of Óin’s group, and Ori is the only one who is known for sure. With so little information we can’t precisely know how many there were. However we do know that their remains were left at both sets of door in the Chamber of Mazarbul,<ref name=\"Bridge\">{{FR|Bridge}}</ref> which considering the size of the area would mean no more than thirty or forty could have remained.\n\nOf the Orcs we know that they were many.<ref name=\"Bridge\">{{FR|Bridge}}</ref> It is also a possibility that Trolls could have been present with the Orcs too as was seen over [[Battle of the Chamber of Mazarbul|twenty years later]].<ref name=\"Bridge\">{{FR|Bridge}}</ref>\n\n==The Battle==\nAs the Orcs were besieging the chamber, Ori wrote his final account of the colony's history in the [[Book of Mazarbul]]. Soon after the Orcs breached the doors, and [[Ori]] and his kinsmen made their final stand at both entrances; eventually succumbing to the onslaught of Orcs, and their treasures plundered, and their bodies left desecrated.<ref name=\"Bridge\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the colony obliterated, no news or reports came to Erebor, and concern grew as the years passed. After 24 years, King [[Dáin Ironfoot]] sent [[Glóin]], the brother of Óin, to [[Rivendell]] to see if Lord [[Elrond]] would have any information.<ref name=\"Council\">{{FR|Council}}</ref>\nGlóin's son [[Gimli]] later went to Moria with the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] and discovered the Chamber of Mazarbul, the Book of the same name, and the truth as to what happened to his kinsmen.<ref name=\"Bridge\"/>\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Conflicts of the Third Age]]"}}}
