As the messengers returned with the answer of [[Fëanor]] and the [[Noldor]], [[Manwë]] declared that eventually, just as [[Eru]] promised, good shall come out of the evil that comes. Yet [[Mandos]] responded, saying that it would still remain evil nonetheless and that Fëanor would soon die.\n\nManwë commanded [[Yavanna]] and [[Nienna]] to try and heal the [[Two Trees]], but they were able only to coax a single flower from [[Telperion]] and a single fruit from [[Laurelin]] before both trees expired. Their lifeless husks would remain in Valinor as a memorial. \n[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Gates of Morning.jpg|left|thumb|''The Gates of Morning'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nThe fruit and flower were set in special vessels that were given to [[Varda]], who gave them the power to fly in the skies. They did this in order to spread [[light]] back to [[Middle-earth]], which had lain in darkness since the fall of the [[Two Lamps]]. In addition, the race of [[Men]] would soon come, but the Valar did not know where Men would arise, so the light would frustrate the plans of [[Morgoth]] and protect Men. The Valar were extremely hesitant to directly intervene and attack Morgoth, as they were afraid that Middle-earth might be seriously damaged in another war if they became involved.\n\nThe driver of the sun vessel would be [[Arien]], a spirit of fire. The driver of the moon vessel would be [[Tilion]], a follower of [[Oromë]] who had loved Telperion's light. These would both drive the vessels in circuits across the sky. The fruit of Laurelin became the [[Sun]], while the flower of Telperion became the [[Moon]], and they received many names in the [[Elvish]] tongues.\n\nThe sight of the Moon gave the [[Noldor]] of [[Fingolfin]] joy, and they blew their trumpets in greeting. The sight of the Sun dismayed Morgoth, who sent forth great clouds to try and darken the sky when it was out. Yet he could not fully accomplish this, and the Sun began to wake the creatures under the [[Sleep of Yavanna]] from their slumber. Full light thus finally returned to Middle-earth after thousands of years of only starlight.\n\nEach vessel remained in the sky for a time, starting in the [[Uttermost East]] and then slowly traversing the sky until reaching Valinor. Arien would be fairly constant, but Tilion would be wayward, sometimes coming close to Arien, other times entering Valinor from different ways or remaining long underground beneath Arda on the way back east. Thus the movements of the Moon are inconstant, or it may not appear in the sky altogether on some nights.\n\nHaving set the Sun and Moon into motion, the Valar fortified the realm of [[Aman]] in what is known as the ''[[Nurtalë Valinóreva]]'', the Hiding of Valinor. They raised up high mountains around the entire realm, leaving only a gap at the [[Calacirya]] for the sake of the elves who remained in Valinor. They then created a series of [[Enchanted Isles]] and other traps to block any ships trying to sail to Aman. Thus, the realm of Aman was defended, and the [[Noldor]] shut out so that they could not return. For the rest of the [[First Age]], Valinor was closed to anyone who tried to enter, save [[Eärendil|one]] in later days...\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.entmoot.com/showthread.php?t=8966 Chapter discussion at Entmoot.com]\n\n[[fr:tolkien/resumes/silm/qs11]]\n[[fi:Aurinko ja Kuu ja Valinorin vetäytyminen (Silmarillion)]]"}}}
