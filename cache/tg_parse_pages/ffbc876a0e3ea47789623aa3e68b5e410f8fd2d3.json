In those days the [[Noldor]] learned great skill of craftsmanship, and [[Rúmil (elf of Tirion)|Rúmil]] of [[Tirion]] first created [[Sarati|signs for writing]]. The son of [[Finwë]] and [[Míriel]] was also born during this time. He was called [[Fëanor]]. However, after the birth of Fëanor, Míriel was consumed in [[Fëa and hröa|body and spirit]], and longed for release from life. Finwë was troubled, and Míriel departed to [[Lórien (Valinor)|Lórien]], where it was hoped she would find healing and rest. But even as she lay down to sleep, her spirit left her body and came to the [[Halls of Mandos]], and Finwë grieved the loss of his wife.\n\nHe afterwards devoted all of his love to his son Fëanor, who grew to be mightiest among the Noldor in body and mind. Fëanor became skilled in the making of gems and bright jewels. He was wedded to [[Nerdanel]], whose father [[Mahtan]] taught him much of the working of metal and stone. To Fëanor Nerdanel bore [[Sons of Fëanor|seven sons]].\n\nNow Finwë the father of Fëanor wedded [[Indis]], his second wife, and was happy again. But Fëanor cared little for Indis, or for her sons, [[Fingolfin]] and [[Finarfin]], and there was division between them. It came to pass that [[Melkor]] was granted pardon, and was released to dwell in [[Valmar]], having served his term. For [[Manwë]] perceived not the evil that remained in Melkor's heart, though not all the [[Valar]] were deceived. And Melkor afterwards feigned friendship with the Noldor, teaching them much. Many were eager to learn what he taught, but Fëanor despised him most among the [[Eldalië]].\n\n==External links==\n* [https://entmoot.tolkientrail.com/showthread.php?t=8122 Chapter discussion at Entmoot.com]\n* [https://forum.barrowdowns.com/showthread.php?t=13580 Chapter discussion at BarrowDowns.com]\n\n[[fr:tolkien/resumes/silm/qs6]]\n[[fi:Fëanor ja Melkorin vapautuminen (Silmarillion)]]"}}}
