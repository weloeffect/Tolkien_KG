''essi'') is a noun meaning \"name\" in [[Quenya]].<ref name=\"Names\">{{App|Letters}}, Note, ''The names of the letters''</ref> Compare with ''[[eneth]]'' in [[Sindarin]].\n\n==Elvish Naming==\nAccording to the naming traditions of [[High Elves]], an Elf can have four types of names, acquired at various times of their lives. The three first names are called the '''''anessi''''' (\"given-names\"): the ''[[father-name]]'',<ref group=\"note\">There is no attested Quenya term for this name, but we can conjecture it is ''ataressë''.</ref> the ''[[amilessë]]'' (\"mother-name\"), and the ''[[epessë]]'' (\"after-name\" or honorary title). The last type of name is called the '''''[[kilmessë]]''''': the ''chosen-name'' (\"self-name\").<ref>{{MR|P3II3a}}, pp. 214-7</ref>\n\n====Anessi====\n* [[Father-name]]: chosen by the father and often based on the father's own name or derived from old legends. Given at or near birth.\n* [[Amilessë]]: chosen by the mother and often prophetic in nature. Given sometimes at or near birth but often bestowed years later.\n* [[Epessë]]: often acquired by an Elf as an honorific later in life.\n\n====Kilmessë====\n* [[Kilmessë]]: a name chosen by an Elf for him- or herself as a disguise or to refer to deeds, talents and personal history.\n\nThe ''father-name'' and the ''amilessë'' were the Elf's 'true names' and were public names. The ''father-name'' is the name an Elf used in public until an ''epessë'' was chosen.<ref>{{PM|Mother}}, p. 339</ref> In ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', when an Elf does not yet have an ''epessë'', the Sindarin version of his mother- or father-name is used instead.\n\n===Examples===\n* '''[[Maglor]]''': The son of [[Fëanor]] of the [[House of Finwë]], was given the ''essë'' ''Kanafinwë'' (\"Strong-voiced [of] Finwë\"). His amilessë was ''[[Makalaurë]]'' (\"Forging Gold\" in a poetic sense).<ref name=\"Sons\">{{PM|Feanor}}, p. 353</ref> The name Maglor is the [[Sindarin]] version of his mother-name.\n\n* '''[[Gil-galad|Ereinion Gil-galad]]''': The son of [[Orodreth]] was given the ''essë [[Gil-galad|Ereinion]]'' (\"Scion of Kings\").<ref>{{PM|Gil-galad}}, p. 350</ref> His ''epessë'' was ''[[Gil]]-[[galad]]'' (\"Star of Radiance\") given to him because his armour and shield were overlaid with silver and set with a device of white stars, shone from afar like a star in sunlight or moonlight and could be seen by Elvish eyes at a great distance if he stood upon a height.<ref name=\"Descendant\">{{PM|Finwe}}, p. 347</ref>\n\n* '''[[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]]''': The son of [[Finarfin]] was given the ''essë'' of ''[[Finrod|Findaráto]]'' (\"Golden-haired Champion\"). His amilessë was ''[[Ingoldo]]'' (\"The Noldo\", singular for [[Noldor]]).<ref name=\"Descend\">{{PM|Finwe}}, p. 346</ref> He is usually referred to as ''[[Felagund]]'' (\"Hewer of Caves\"),<ref>{{PM|Felagund}}, p. 351-2</ref> originally a derogatory nickname given to him because of his dwelling at [[Nargothrond]]. Finrod adopted the name as his ''epessë'' and made it a title of honour. The name Finrod is the Sindarin version of his father-name.\n\n* '''[[Galadriel]]''': The only daughter of Finarfin was given the ''essë'' of ''[[Artanis]]'' (\"Noble Woman\") and the ''amilessë'' of ''[[Nerwen]]'' (\"Man-maiden\") because of her height and strength.<ref name=\"Descend\"/> Her ''epessë'', ''[[Alatáriel]]'' (\"Maiden Crowned with Radiant Garland\"), was given to her by her husband, [[Celeborn]]. The name Galadriel is the Sindarin version of her ''epessë''.<ref name=\"Descendant\"/>\n\n* '''[[Amras]]''': The last son of the House of Finwë was given the ''essë'' ''[[Telufinwë]]'', (\"Last [of] Finwë\"). His first ''amilessë'' was ''[[Ambarussa]]'' (\"Top-russet\" referring to his hair), his twin-brother [[Amrod]] had the same ''amilessë''. To distinguish the two Amrod was given a second ''amilessë'': ''[[Umbarto]]'' (\"The Fated\").<ref name=\"Sons\"/> His mother's choice was prophetic, because Amrod was the first of the [[sons of Fëanor]] to die, accidentally killed in the swan ships of the Teleri when his father ordered them to be burnt at [[Losgar]]. The name Amras is the Sindarin version of ''Ambarussa''.\n\n==Tengwa==\n[[Image:Essë.gif|left]]''Essë'' is also the name in later Quenya of the thirty-first letter of the [[Tengwar]] alphabet, representing '''SS'''.  The original name of this letter was ''Áze'', but over time the phonemes for \"z\" and \"r\" merged and the letter was renamed ''Áre''.  Since ''[[Óre]]'' (letter 21) represents untrilled \"r\" and ''[[Rómen]]'' (letter 25) represents trilled \"r\", ''Áre'' became superfluous.  This letter was then renamed ''Essë'' and represents \"ss\", but only in written Quenya.<ref name=\"Names\"/>\n\n<!-- An extra blank line is needed to prevent the \"See Also\" section title from indenting. -->\n==See also==\n* [http://www.uib.no/People/hnohf/qlist.htm Quenya Corpus Wordlist] edited by [[Helge Fauskanger]]\n\n{{references|Notes}}\n{{title|lowercase}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Esse}}\n[[Category:Quenya nouns]]\n[[Category:Tengwar letters]]\n[[de:Namensgebung]]\n[[fr:langues/textes/noms-elfes]]\n[[fi:Eldarin nimenantotavat]]"}}}
