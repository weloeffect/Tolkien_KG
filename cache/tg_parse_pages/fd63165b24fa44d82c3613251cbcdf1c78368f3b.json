Tolkien]], first published in [[1982]]. It tells the story of Mr. Bliss and his first ride in his new motor-car. Many adventures follow: encounters with bears, angry neighbours, irate shopkeepers, and assorted collisions.\n\nThe story was inspired by Tolkien's own vehicular mishaps with his first car, purchased in [[1932]]. The bears were based on toy bears owned by Tolkien's sons. Tolkien was both author and illustrator of the book. His narrative binds the story and illustrations tightly together, as the text often comments directly on the pictures.\n\nThe first edition of the book reproduces the full manuscript, with transcription on each facing page. The [[2011]] edition presents the typed text with drawings integrated into it, with the entire first edition included at the back, so the book can be read both forwards and backwards.\n\n==Plots and characters==\n{| style=\"margin:0 auto;\" class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" width=100% align=center\n|-\n! align=left | <big>Plots</big>\n|-\n| <br>Mr Bliss lives with his pet Girabbit in a white house with red roofs. Girabbit informs Mr Bliss that it will be a \"fine day\" so he decides to buy a yellow car, with red wheels, from Mr Binks for five shillings and sixpence; forgetting his purse, Mr Bliss leaves his silver bicycle with Mr Binks as collateral. However, on his way to visit the Dorkinses, Mr Bliss proves to be a careless driver, driving into Mr Day and breaking his barrow of carriages, and then round the next corner driving into Mrs Knight and breaking her donkey cart of bananas. He gives a lift to both Mr Day and Mrs Knight, with the donkey tied at the back.\n\nWhen they reach the wood, they encounter three bears: Archie, Bruno and Teddy. After scaring the group, the three bears use the donkey to carry the cabbages and bananas and hide them in the wood for themselves. When they return, they insist on joining Mr Bliss in visiting the Dorkinses as they \"could know them\". Rolling down the Hill from the Wood they crash into the Dorkinses' garden wall with Mr Bliss, Mr Day, Mrs Knight and the three bears landing right in the middle of the Dorkinses' picnic, with Archie landing in their soup-terrine; the donkey flew up in the air and landed in the car. The Dorkins brothers - Fattie, Albert, Herbert and Egbert - were angry at their picnic being ruined, but the group stayed for lunch, while the bears went off for a walk and ate all the cabbages, apples and potatoes in the kitchen-garden. Furious, Albert Dorkins set the dogs on the bears.\n\nThe bears run off anyway saying they have bananas and cabbages; Mr Day and Mrs Knight want their cabbages and bananas back, but Mr Bliss only agrees to join them if the Dorkinses come with the dogs. Mr Bliss, Mr Day, Mrs Knight, the four Dorkineses and their dogs, travel in the car which is pulled by the donkey and three horses owned by the Dorkinses (Fattie Dorkins was too fat to own a horse). At the Cross Roads they stop at the inn for tea (and the bill for it all goes to Mr Bliss), and they then reach Three Bears Wood at dusk. The dogs track the bears but they have painted themselves to look like \"bogies, or ghosts, or [[goblins]], or all three\" and Mr Bliss runs off in terror. The bears start laughing and everyone else goes to the Bears' House for supper - eating cold chicken, ham, lettuces, beetroot, trifle, cheese, brown bread, and asparagus - and they all stay the night.\n\nHowever, Mr Bliss ran away during the night and by the morning he had reached the village. He recovered his bicycle from Mr Binks's shed without paying for the car, so Mr Binks tried to persuade Sergeant Boffin to lock Mr Bliss up as a thief; the bears, the Dorkinses, Mr Day and Mrs Knight all arrive in the village determined to get money from Mr Bliss for the various expenses incurred, so they join Mr Binks and Sergeant Boffin in going to Mr Bliss's house. But, when they arrived at Mr Bliss's houses they were scared away by a Girabbit that was so big its head stuck out from the chimney. After everyone has left, Mr Bliss settled all his debts, and then gave the car to Mr Day as wedding present in his marriage to Mrs Knight; everyone attended the wedding, including the Girabbit. Afterwards, Mr Bliss drives a donkey-cart instead, his only worry is children trespassing in his garden to try to see the Girabbit.\n|}\n\n{| style=\"margin:0 auto;\" class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" width=100% align=center\n|-\n! align=left | <big>Characters</big>\n|-\n| <br>Listed in order of appearance:\n* '''Mr J.

Tolkien: A Biography]]'', the story was inspired by Tolkien's own driving mishaps following the purchase of his first car in [[1932]],<ref name=\"Bio217\">{{HM|Bio}}, pp. 217-8</ref> however Joan Tolkien ([[Michael Tolkien]]'s wife) asserts that it was based on a toy car that was [[Christopher Tolkien]]'s most cherished toy, with the three bears based on three teddy bears owned by Tolkien's own sons.<ref>\"Letters\" in ''The Times'', [[10 October]] 1982, p. 25</ref> Christopher Tolkien suggests from the handwriting it is more likely to be 1930s than 1920s.<ref name=\"RG788\">{{CG|RG}}, p. 788</ref> [[Wayne G. Hammond|Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull|Scull]] thought that it was likely to have been produced in a short summer break, and suggest the summers of [[1929]], [[1930]] or [[1931]] as the most likely candidates.<ref>{{HM|AI}}, p. 86</ref> However, in a holiday to Cornwall in 1932 Tolkien named a local character \"[[Gaffer Gamgee]]\" which Hammond and Scull acknowledge indicates a later date.<ref name=\"RG788\" />\n\nFollowing the success of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', in 1936 Tolkien submitted ''Mr. Bliss'' to [[Allen and Unwin]] alongside ''[[Roverandom]]'', ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'', and \"[[The Lost Road]]\".<ref>{{HM|Bio}}, p. 244</ref> The publishers seriously and realistically considered publication, but the cost of reproducing the images would be too expensive, so the publishers asked Tolkien to redraw them in a simpler style; although he wasn't sure he could improve it<ref>{{L|31}}</ref> and hoped the publishers could find another artist,<ref>{{L|23}}</ref> Tolkien agreed<ref>{{L|10}}</ref> although he never found the time to do so.<ref name=\"Bio217\"/> The original manuscripts - alongside those of ''The Hobbit'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''Farmer Giles of Ham'' - were sold to [[Marquette University]] in [[1957]] for £1,250.<ref>{{HM|Bio}}, pp. 299</ref> [[Clyde S. Kilby]] became aware of the ''Mr. Bliss'' in [[1964]] and, once again, Tolkien and [[Rayner Unwin]] considered publication but, again, felt that the artwork needed reproducing in order to be published.<ref name=\"RG789\">{{CG|RG}}, p. 789</ref>\n\nFollowing Tolkien's death in 1973, Christopher Tolkien and the [[Tolkien Estate]] worked to release Tolkien's unpublished materials. ''Mr. Bliss'' was published by George Allen and Unwin in 1982 exactly as Tolkien drew, with typeset text opposite Tolkien's original drawings;<ref>[[J.R.R.
