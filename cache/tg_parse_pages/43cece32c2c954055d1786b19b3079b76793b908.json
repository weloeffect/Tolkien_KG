They moved westwards later than the Folk of Haleth and had stayed in [[Eriador]], either in settlements or wandering around, and had not moved on to [[Beleriand]]. The language of the Folk of Haleth was not related to the language of the [[House of Hador|Folk of Hador]] and the [[House of Bëor|Folk of Bëor]].<ref name=\"Atani\">{{PM|Atani}}</ref>\n\n===Second Age===\nAt the time of the explorations of [[Aldarion]], heir to the throne of [[Númenor]], Enedwaith was covered by an almost continuous forest with the exception of the great fens of the [[Swanfleet]]. The native inhabitants were quite numerous and warlike and lived in scattered communities in the forests without a central leadership. In the beginning, the native inhabitants of Enedwaith were in awe of the [[Númenóreans]].<ref name=\"ThirdParagraph\">{{UT|6d}}, discussion of the river Gwathló, third paragraph</ref> Enedwaith was still covered with a dense forest at the time of the earlier settlements of the Númenóreans.<ref name=\"Atani\" />\n\nThe native inhabitants started to ambush the Númenóreans when the felling of trees by the Númenóreans became devastating to the forests. As a consequence, the Númenóreans treated the native inhabitants as enemies. The natives of Enedwaith that survived the conflicts with the Númenóreans fled into the eastern mountains to a region that would later be known as [[Dunland]].<ref name=\"ThirdParagraph\" />\n\nIn the time of the Númenórean King [[Ar-Adûnakhôr]], the [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] settlers between [[Pelargir]] and the [[Gulf of Lune]] classified the inhabitants of the forests of [[Minhiriath]] as [[Men of Darkness|Men of Shadow]] instead of as [[Middle Men]]. This was due to their hostility to the Númenóreans. It was also because the Númenóreans did not recognize them as kinsmen of the Edain. This was due to the language of the inhabitants of the forests of Minhiriath not being related to the languages of the Folk of Hador and the Folk of Beor, which were the languages from which the [[Adûnaic]] language of Númenor was descended.<ref>{{PM|Atani}}, including Note 72</ref>\n\nAfter the establishment of the kingdoms of Arnor and Gondor in {{SA|3320}}, Enedwaith belonged to neither of those two kingdoms.<ref name=\"Glanduin\" />\n\n===Third Age===\nIn the earlier centuries of Arnor and Gondor<ref name=\"NM\">{{NM|P3xxii}}, p. 378</ref><ref name=\"RC\">{{HM|RC}}, p. 650</ref><ref name=\"VT\">{{VT|42a}}</ref> Enedwaith belonged to neither of the two kingdoms.<ref name=\"Glanduin\"/> In those ancient days, the [[Gwathló]] was the eastern border of Arnor and the Isen was the western border of Gondor.<ref name=\"Isen\">{{UT|11c}}, note to the text, first paragraph</ref> Until the decay of Arnor, both kingdoms shared an interest in this region, but were mainly concerned with the building and maintenance of the [[North-South Road]], which was the main route of transport between the two kingdoms except by sea, and of the bridge at the fortified town and haven of [[Tharbad]] and of the long causeways on which the road ran to Tharbad on either side of the Gwathló across the fens in the plains of Enedwaith.<ref name=\"Glanduin\" /> There were no permanent settlements of people of Númenórean origin in Enedwaith,<ref name=\"Glanduin\" /> except at Tharbad,<ref name=\"NM\" /><ref name=\"RC\" /><ref name=\"VT\" /> where a large garrison of soldiers, mariners, engineers<ref name=\"Glanduin\" /> and river-wardens was stationed.<ref name=\"NM\" /><ref name=\"RC\" /><ref name=\"VT\" /> In addition, the drainage works were built and maintained and the banks of the rivers [[Mitheithel]] and Gwathló were strengthened.<ref name=\"NM\" /><ref name=\"RC\" /><ref name=\"VT\" />\n\nAfter the decay and receding of the kingdom of Arnor, which had originally included Minhiriath,<ref name=\"NM\" /><ref name=\"RC\" /><ref name=\"VT\" /> Enedwaith became a part of Gondor during the days of the Kings of Gondor.
