It was surrounded by low trees inside an outer hedge, and there were no other dwellings nearby. This house was occasionally occupied with [[Brandybuck Family|Brandybuck]] [[Hobbits]] who grew tired of the often crowded [[Brandy Hall]].<ref name=\"Conspiracy\">{{FR|I5}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Frodo Baggins]] was instructed by [[Gandalf]] to find a reason why he should leave [[Hobbiton]] (and [[the Shire]]) and meet him in [[Bree]]. In the summer of {{TA|3018}}, [[Frodo Baggins]] bought this house as an excuse for leaving [[Hobbiton]] to the east.<ref>{{FR|I3}}</ref>\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Bathing at Crickhollow.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ted Nasmith]] - Bathing at Crickhollow]]\nWhile Frodo, [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] moved out, [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Fredegar Bolger|Fatty Bolger]] were already in the house at Crickhollow, making preparations for their arrival. They were the only Hobbits who knew that Frodo would begin a journey to the east, so they made preparations for their departure as well.\n\nOn [[25 September]], Frodo and his company arrived at the lodgings and met Merry and Fatty. The next day Frodo and his party departed for the [[Old Forest]]. It was decided that to hide Frodo's departure, Fatty would stay at Crickhollow to maintain the pretence that Frodo was still in residence.<ref name=\"Conspiracy\"/> Frodo spent only one night; at [[26 September|dawn]], they picked up the ponies from a nearby stable and rode to the [[High Hay]].\n\nIn the early hours of [[30 September]], three [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] came to the house in Crickhollow,<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> but Fatty Bolger had already escaped. He had run to the nearest house, and from there he spread the news of an invasion, which travelled swiftly to [[Brandy Hall]] and resulted in the rousing of the hobbits of [[Buckland]].<ref>{{FR|I11}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[War of the Ring]], Merry and Pippin lived together for some time at Crickhollow.<ref>{{RK|VI9}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] noted that the first element is obsolete and of obscure meaning. A ''hollow'' is a small depression in the ground.<ref name=\"Nomen\">{{HM|N}}, p. 768</ref>\n\nBased on this, [[David Salo]] has suggested a speculative [[Old English|Old Hobbitish]] form *''Crycholh'' from which Crickhollow derives. The obscure element ''cryc'' could represent, as can be expected in [[Stoorish]], a [[Celtic]] ([[Wikipedia:British language|Old Brythonic]]) word for \"hill\". The placename would therefore mean \"low place by the hill\".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=https://tolkienlistsearch.herokuapp.com/message/5e9c35b63ee6a6c41e9862d6|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names (1.21)|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]|accessed=2022-09-23}}</ref>\n\nIt is not clear in ''The Lord of the Rings'' whether Crickhollow was a village or a region occupied by a solitary house. The [[Encyclopedia of Arda]] mentions Crickhollow as a village.<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/c/crickhollow.html|articlename=Crickhollow|website=[[Encyclopedia of Arda]]|author=Mark Fisher|accessed=6 August 2012}}</ref> [[Robert Foster]] describes Crickhollow as a \"place in Buckland\"<ref>[[Robert Foster]], ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', p. 75, entry \"Crickhollow\"</ref> whereas [[Karen Fonstad]] believes that Crickhollow is just the name of Frodo's house.<ref>[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]], ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'', p. 120</ref>\n\n== Portrayals in adaptations ==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Crickhollow.jpg|thumb|250px|Crickhollow in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Crickhollow is visited by players during the Volume 1 Epic Book, \"Stirrings in the Darkness\".
