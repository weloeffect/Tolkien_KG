Its westernmost point was the [[Three-Farthing Stone]], its eastern border was the [[Baranduin|Brandywine]] River, and its southern border was the River [[Shirebourn]]. Within its bounds were the regions of [[Bridgefields]], the [[Marish]], and [[The Yale]].<ref name=map>{{FR|Part}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nGeographical features were the forest of [[Woody End]], the hills of [[Scary]] and the [[Green Hill Country]] and the rivers [[Stock-brook]], [[Thistle Brook]], and [[The Water]].\n\nHobbit settlements included [[Brockenbores]], [[Budgeford]], [[Deephallow]], [[Dwaling]], [[Frogmorton]], [[Rushey]], [[Scary]], [[Stock]], [[Whitfurrows]], [[Willowbottom]] and [[Woodhall]].<ref name=map/>\n\nSeveral roads that connected the towns and villages were [[East Road]], [[Causeway]] and [[Northway]]<ref>Causeway and Northway are not named on the map.</ref>\n\n==History==\nAbout {{TA|1630}} many [[Stoors]] from [[Dunland]] entered and settled in the Eastfarthing.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> Throughout that Age, whenever [[Bree-hobbits]] visited the Shire, they mostly reached [[Buckland]] or the Eastfarthing, as these were closest to their home, and rarely ventured further west.\n\nWhen [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] travelled from [[Bag End]] to [[Crickhollow]] much of their trek took place in the Eastfarthing, where they first encountered the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] and were protected by [[Gildor|Gildor Inglorion]].<ref>{{FR|I3}}</ref> Continuing eastward, the crossed the fields of the Marish and met [[Farmer Maggot]] before they left the Eastfarthing on the [[Bucklebury Ferry]].<ref name=\"mushroom\"/>\n\nUpon their return from their adventures in the south, Frodo, Sam, Pippin, and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] discovered the evil afoot in the Shire when they entered the Eastfarthing. On the first night they stayed at the uncomfortable guard-house near the [[Brandywine Bridge]]. At Frogmorton the Travellers were “arrested” and the spent the night at the Shirriff-house. The next morning they journeyed westward and left the Eastfarthing.<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nBy the time of the [[War of the Ring]] the inhabitants of the Eastfarthing were still mainly Stoors, especially in the Marish, known by their large build and heavy-legs, and the small beard on their chin; they were known for many peculiar names and strange words ([[Stoorish]]) uncommon in the rest of the Shire.<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref> Some months of the [[Shire Calendar]], in the Eastfarthing had different names, the ones used in the [[Bree Calendar]].<ref>{{App|Calendars}}</ref>\n\nIn muddy regions, such as the Marish, Hobbits wore dwarf-boots and were house-dwellers, like [[Farmer Maggot]].<ref name=\"mushroom\">{{FR|I4}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Golden Perch]]'' inn was said by [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] to serve the best beer in the Eastfarthing.<ref name=\"mushroom\"/>\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Regions of the Shire]]\n\n[[de:Ostviertel]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/regions/comte/quartier est]]\n[[fi:Itäneljännys]]"}}}
