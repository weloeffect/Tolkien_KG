Tolkien]]'s earlier phases of his legendarium to describe the race of [[Elves]] that would become the '''[[Noldor]]'''.\n\nThe names of the Noldoli are in the [[Gnomish]] or [[Noldorin]] languages.\n\n==External history==\nGnomes and Noldoli were both used from the beginning of Tolkien's legendarium, [[The Book of Lost Tales]]. Noldoli became the later form Noldor c. the mid-1930s, when most of the major texts of the Silmarillion tradition had new revised versions made, all having Noldor where earlier texts had Noldoli.<ref>{{LR|P2I}}, p. 108</ref> Gnome, however, continued to be used well after this point. It was published in the first edition of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' in 1937.<ref>{{LT1|In}}, p. 43</ref> It continued to be used in drafting of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref>{{RS|1XII}}, p. 212</ref><ref>{{TI|VI}}, p. 124</ref> It was even used as far into the story as the drafting of the chapter that became \"[[The Window on the West]]\", which was written in 1944.<ref>{{WR|2|V}}, pp. 144, 160</ref> However, by the time Tolkien began to draft the material that became the [[Appendices]] to ''The Lord of the Rings'' in the late 1940s, the problems with the term were recognized, and eventually it was deemed \"too misleading\" due to confusion with the popular concept of gnomes.<ref>{{PM|II}}, pp. 23-4, 76-7</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nIn a letter dating from [[1973]], Tolkien stated that the word ''gnome'' derives from  [[Wikipedia:Paracelsus|Paracelsus]],<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], \"[[Letter to Elena Jeronimides]]\" (letter)</ref> who is known to have used Modern Latin ''gnomus'' in a 16th century treatise.<ref>{{webcite|author=Douglas Harper|articleurl=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gnome&allowed_in_frame=0|articlename=gnome|dated=|website=[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php Online Etymology Dictionary]|accessed=19 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Gnome'' of Paracelsus likely means \"earth-dweller\". The basis for Tolkien's use of ''Gnome'' was Greek ''gnōmē'' meaning thought or intelligence.<ref>{{LT1|In}}, pp. 43-44</ref>\n\nCf. also the [[Mannish]] word ''[[nóm]]'' meaning \"wisdom\".<ref>{{S|17}}</ref>\n\nAfter the flight of Noldoli and slaughter of [[Solosimpi]], the gnomes who stayed in Aman and did not join other tribes were called '''''Aulenossë''''' (''nossë'' \"kind, people\" is related to ''-nor'' in ''[[Valinor]]'' (root NO in a dictionary of Qenya)<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, entries \"Aulenossë\" and \"Valinor\"</ref>), the people of [[Aulë]]. He himself called the gnomes who stayed in his palace just Eldar.<ref>{{LT1|VIII}}</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nA [[Wikipedia:Gnome|Gnome]] is a dwarf-like creature of European folklore, often associated with [[Dwarves]] and [[Orcs|Goblins]]. Traditional Gnomes however were unlike his depiction of his [[High Elves]]: they were imagined as deformed underground dwellers, and by the 19th century were depicted dwarf-like. \n\nFor that reason Tolkien dropped the term since that would confuse the readers. However, other folkloric names like \"Elves\", \"Dwarves\" and \"Goblins\" would persist in Tolkien's writing ever since, although he would be unsure about them (he did replace \"Goblin\" with \"[[Orcs]]\" after the publication of ''[[The Hobbit]]'').\n\nIn the first Portuguese translation of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the title of the book is translated as ''[[Wiktionary:gnomo#Portuguese|gnomo]]'', the Portuguese word for gnome. See: ''[[O Gnomo]]''.\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nAt one time, \"Gnomes\" also referred to the [[Valar]].{{fact}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{WP|Gnome}}\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Elven peoples]]\n[[Category:Gnomes]]\n[[Category:Races in The Book of Lost Tales]]"}}}
