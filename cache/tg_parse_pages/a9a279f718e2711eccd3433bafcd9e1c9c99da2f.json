Tolkien]] into a single publication (in a manner similar to ''[[The Children of Húrin]]''). The story draws upon texts from ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[Unfinished Tales]]: \"[[Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin]]''\", and ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]''.\n\n''The Tale of Gondolin'' was not backed by the [[Tolkien Estate]], although it is claimed that [[Priscilla Tolkien]] gave a verbal permission to Lewis to work with the project.<ref>[http://www.hobbit.ca/Gondolin-variations.html Hobbit.ca: \"The Tale of Gondolin\", as of April 14, 2010]</ref> \n\nThe publication was limited to 50 copies worldwide and the suggested value for a single copy is well over $1,000. \n\n==Contents==\n\n*Preface to second edition\n*Preface: Page 1\n*Introduction to illustrated and illuminated edition: Page 4 \n*1.

One was red leather bound and given to [[Priscilla Tolkien]] and the other was clothbound for Lewis. Neither copies were signed or illustrated.\n\n===First State===\n[[Image:The Tale of Gondolin1.jpg|thumb|The cover of the first state]]\n\nIn [[1992]], artist [[Ruth Lacon]] was commissioned to make illustrations for the book. She strived to create \"a modern analogue to an illustrated and illuminated medieval manuscript.\"<ref>\"A note from Ruth Lacon\" in ADC Art & Books: catalogue 2009/10, p.30.</ref>\n\nBy the end of [[1995]], 28 out of the 50 copies had been sold though they were not sold in sequential order. The \"Number One\" was donated to Priscilla Tolkien. These 28 are known as the First State.\n\n===Second State===\n[[Image:The Tale of Gondolin.jpg|thumb|The cover of the second state]]\nIn late 2003 or early 2004 a US book collector found out from Alex Lewis that the remaining 22 copies had not been sold and were still unbound. He chose to buy the 22 copies and had them bound by another binder in Manchester as the original binder had unfortunately passed away. These 22 newly bound copies were finished in 2004 and are known as the Second State.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/reviews/taleofgondolin.htm Review by TolkienLibrary.com]\n* [http://www.hobbit.ca/Gondolin.html More information at Hobbit.ca]\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/tolkienfans/comments/z4ixz1/fan_project_a_composite_version_of_the_fall_of/ \"Fan project: a composite version of 'The Fall of Gondolin'\" at Reddit.com]\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[The Ruins of Osgiliath]]''\n* ''[[The Fall of Gondolin]]''\n\n{{references}}\n{{title|italics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tale of Gondolin}}\n[[Category:Books by J.R.R.
