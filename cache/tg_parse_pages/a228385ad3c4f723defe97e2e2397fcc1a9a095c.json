For I will sing to you of [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo of the Nine Fingers]] and the [[One Ring|Ring of Doom]].|The [[Minstrels|minstrel]] of [[Gondor]] in ''[[The Return of the King]]'', \"[[The Field of Cormallen]]\"}}\n\n'''Of Frodo of the Nine Fingers and the Ring of Doom''' was an epic unnamed lay that was sung by an unnamed [[Minstrel of Gondor|minstrel]] of [[Gondor]].<ref name=\"Song\">{{RK|Cormallen}}, pp. 951-7</ref>\n\n== History ==\nOn the [[Field of Cormallen]], a minstrel of Gondor begged the king for his permission to sing. Before waiting for [[Aragorn|Aragorn's]] leave, the minstrel announced that he was going to relate, in his lay, the [[Quest of the Ring|tale]] \"of [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo of the Nine Fingers]] and the [[Ring of Doom]]\",<ref name=\"Song\"/> possibly meaning that this was the name of the lay, but this is unclear.\n\nThis pleased [[Samwise Gamgee]] so greatly that he wept immediately after hearing this, and the rest of the listeners joined him. The minstrel's clear voice was said to alternate between one of the [[Elvish|elven-tongues]] and [[Westron]]. The lay made the hearts of the listeners overflow with joy at the sweet words and they began weeping.<ref name=\"Song\"/>\n\nThe minstrel's lay lasted almost that entire day, and he concluded it just as the evening began.<ref name=\"Song\"/>\n\n== Portrayal in adaptations ==\n'''1980: ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)]]'':'''\n:The unnamed lay in the original text was turned into a song referred to in the soundtrack as '''Frodo of the Nine Fingers'''.{{Fact}} It was put to music by [[Maury Laws]] and given lyrics by [[Jules Bass]]. While the [[Minstrel of Gondor]] (voiced by [[Glenn Yarbrough]]) still sang it, the lay appeared as the film's framing device and became a song used as entertainment at [[Bilbo Baggins]]' 129th birthday party in [[Rivendell]]. The lyrics created for the film are given as follows:\n\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nFrodo of the Nine Fingers\nAnd the ring of doom...</poem>\n\n:'''SPOKEN (MINSTREL OF GONDOR)''': \"It has its beginnings two Ages past, When [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] set forth to reclaim the [[Dwarves]]' [[gold]] from the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Smaug]]... And while on his quest Bilbo stumbled into a deep dank cave.\"\n\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">When Bilbo found [[The One Ring|that shiny ring]]\nIn [[Gollum]]'s cave of gloom,\nHe never thought that it would turn\nInto a ring of doom.\n\nThe Dragon Smaug, the [[Spiders]], too,\nThe [[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|Goblins]], the [[Thranduil|Elven-king]],\nThey came to know the power of\nThe Hobbit and his ring.\n\nFrodo of the Nine Fingers\nAnd the ring of doom.\nIt started with a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] in\nGollum's cave of gloom.\n\nThe power of the ring, it grew,\nAnd [[Gandalf]] sat in thought.\nHe knew that it must be destroyed\nIn fires where it was wrought.\n\nFor if in evil hands it fell,\nThe earth would know its end.\nNo force of arms would win the day,\nNo army could contend.</poem>\n\n:'''SPOKEN (GANDALF)''': \"For evil flourished everywhere and lay on the land like a festering malignancy. There was one hope though, in a distant land, the noble [[Aragorn]], heir to empty throne on [[Gondor]] awaited the small band to return and become king. But he could not triumph until the ring was destroyed, so went the prophecy.\"\n\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">Frodo of the Nine Fingers\nAnd the ring of doom\nAccepted a heavy burden\nFor the fires to consume.</poem>\n\n:'''SPOKEN (GANDALF)''': \"Frodo and his gallant companion [[Samwise Gamgee|Samwise]] had many brave adventures, until finally they reached the rocky border of [[Mordor]], domained the black lord [[Sauron]]. There, Frodo was captured and imprisoned in the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]]. Samwise vowed to enter the Orc-infested tower alone to save him, and the ring of doom was missing around Frodo's neck.\"\n\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">Frodo of the Nine Fingers\nAnd the ring of doom.\nWhy does he have nine fingers?\nWhere is the ring of doom?\n</poem>\n\n'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''\n:The minstrel begins to perform the lay with the following opening line:\n\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">Frodo went forth on a fateful journey...</poem>\n\n:However, the performance is interrupted by the narrator, leading into a scene change.\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Lays and tales within the legendarium]]\n[[Category:The Return of the King (1980 film) soundtrack]]"}}}
