However, [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]], the [[Sons of Fëanor]], were also at Nargothrond at the time, and persuaded almost all the people of Nargothrond to refuse to accompany Finrod on the quest for the Silmaril so that only [[Edrahil]] and ten companions agreed to go with Finrod and Beren. Finrod gave his crown to Orodreth to rule Nargothrond as a regent in his absence. With Finrod gone, Celegorm and Curufin further swayed the hearts of the people of Nargothrond, and Orodreth had no power to withstand them. The ultimate goal of the brothers was to take control of all Elf-kingdoms before then seeking the Silmarils.  When news came that Finrod had been killed and that Tol-in-Gaurhoth had been destroyed, the sons of Fëanor were shamed and fell from power, as the people cried out that the maiden [[Lúthien]] had done what the sons of Fëanor dared not.

Many there grew restless, believing that if an outlaw could do such hurt to the Enemy, what might not the Lord of Narog do. Orodreth, however, would permit none of his people to join Túrin, and sent messages that Túrin was not to set foot in Nargothrond or drive Orcs into it. He did, however, offer help other than arms, possibly being moved to do so by Thingol and Melian with whom exchanged messages with.<ref>{{CH|8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alarie - Turin in front of Orodreth.jpg|thumb|''Túrin in front of Orodreth'' by [[:Category:Images by Alarie|Alarie]]]]\nIn {{FA|490}},<ref>{{GA|267}}</ref> [[Gwindor]], a prince of Nargothrond and an escaped thrall of Morgoth returning from his captivity in [[Angband]], led [[Túrin]] son of [[Húrin]], a [[Man]] of the [[House of Hador]] to Nargothrond. In Nargothrond, Túrin hid his name, calling himself ''[[Agarwaen]]'', son of ''[[Úmarth]]'' (\"Bloodstained, son of Ill-fate\"). [[Finduilas]], daughter of Orodreth, fell in love with him, but he avoided her because she had previously been the beloved of his friend Gwindor. Túrin declined to tell her his name, so that she called him ''Thurin'' (\"The Secret\"). He was also called ''Adanedhel'' (\"Man-Elf\") because he was so alike to an Elf, though he was a Man.<ref name=\"Narn\">{{UT|Narn}}</ref><ref name=\"Turin\">{{S|Turin}}</ref><ref name=\"CH10\">{{CH|10}}</ref>\n\nHis identity did not remain hidden for long. Gwindor revealed to Finduilas that 'Agarwaen' was in fact Túrin, and 'Úmarth' his famous father Húrin. When the news of this reached Finduilas' father, Orodreth, King of Nargothrond, Túrin was given great honor and standing, but the revelation of Túrin's identity would also bring Morgoth's curse with him.<ref name=\"Narn\" /><ref name=\"Turin\" /><ref name=\"CH10\" />\n[[File:Alan Lee - Fall of Nargothrond.jpg|225px|thumb|left|''Fall of Nargothrond'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]\nTúrin became a chief counselor of Orodreth, and was extremely influential in Nargothrond. He encouraged the people of Nargothrond to abandon their practice of secrecy, and they built a great bridge before the gates. Because of his prowess with [[Gurthang]], his black sword, he himself became known as ''Mormegil'' (\"Black Sword\").<ref name=\"Narn\" /><ref name=\"Turin\" /><ref name=\"CH10\" />\n\nHowever, sometime after, two messengers, named [[Gelmir (messenger of Círdan)|Gelmir]] and [[Arminas]], sent there by [[Círdan]], arrived to Nargothrond, delivering the message from [[Ulmo]], Lord of Waters himself, to the King Orodreth, advising him to shut the doors of Nargothrond and destroy the bridge before its gates. At this time Orodreth relied upon the counsel of Túrin, who scorned the words of the messengers, for it was upon his advice that the bridge had been built and it was his policy for the King's forces to go forth openly to war, and sent them away.<ref name=\"Narn\" /><ref name=\"Turin\" /><ref name=\"Fall\">{{CH|11}}</ref>\n\nThis would prove to be a fatal mistake, since in {{FA|495}},<ref name=\"GAS275\" /> Morgoth unleashed his forces at Nargothrond. Led by [[Glaurung]] the dragon, they devastated the army of Orodreth at the [[Battle of Tumhalad]]. In that battle Orodreth was slain, and after that the [[Fall of Nargothrond]] was inevitable, due to the bridge that allowed Glaurung and Morgoth's host to ravage the city, and most of its people were either enslaved or killed (including Orodreth's daughter Finduilas).<ref name=\"Narn\" /><ref name=\"Turin\" /><ref name=\"Fall\" />\n\n==Etymology==\n''Orodreth'' translates to \"mountaineer\".<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, root '''RETE''', p. 182</ref> Paul Strack suggests that it is a combination of ''[[ered|orod]]'' (\"mountain\") and ''reth'' (\"climber\").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-2927154629.html|articlename=S.

Afterwards, as the legends developed, Orodreth underwent a steady decline into weakness and insignificance, which is very curious. Many years later, when meditating the development of the Túrin saga, my father noted that Orodreth was ‘rather a weak character’; cf. the Narn, p. 160: ‘he turned as he ever did to Túrin for counsel’. Ultimately he was to be displaced as the second King of Nargothrond (Unfinished Tales p. 255, note 20). But all this is a far cry from the hard and grim king in his underground hall depicted in the poem; Felagund had not yet emerged, nor the rebellious power of Celegorm and Curufin in Nargothrond (see further p. 246).|{{LB|1d}}}}\n\n===Early legendarium===\nIn earlier versions of the [[legendarium]], Orodreth was a more important character, and the original king of Nargothrond. However, his importance diminished over time. \n\nIn one of the early versions, he had two sons whose names were translated as [[Ordhelm]] and [[Ordláf]] in [[Old English]] by [[Ælfwine]], though the original [[Elvish]] names were lost to time.<ref name=\"Ord\">{{SM|QA1}}, p. 213</ref> In another version, his two sons were [[Haldir (son of Orodreth)|Haldir]] [< Halmir] who was slain after being trapped by Orcs and hung on a tree,<ref>{{LR|AB}}</ref>{{rp|112}} and a younger son [[Orodlin (son of Orodreth)|Orodlin]].<ref>{{LR|A1}}</ref>{{rp|309}}\n\n===Parentage and children===\nIn the published versions of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' Orodreth is the son of [[Finarfin]] and younger brother of [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]].<ref name=\"Flight\" /><ref name=\"Beleriand\" /><ref name=\"Beren\" /><ref>{{S|Princes}}</ref><ref>{{UT|2o}}, much fuller account of the coming of the Elves Gelmir and Arminas to Nargothrond</ref>\n\nIn J.R.R. Tolkien's updates to the genealogical tables of the descendants of Finwë, dating between 1959-1968, Orodreth's lineage went through several revisions. First, while named as ''Artanáro Rhodothir'', he was changed to be son of Finrod Felegund. When Tolkien apparently recalled that Finrod had no wife or son, Orodreth was then made the son of Finrod's brother, Angrod. Orodreth's name was then changed from ''Artanáro'' to ''Artaresto''. Finally, in a note dated August 1965, Tolkien fully elaborated on both Orodreth (''Artaresto'') being the son of Angrod, and Gil-galad (''Artanáro'') in turn being the son of Orodreth.<ref name=\"Galad\" />\n\n[[Christopher Tolkien]] did not incorporate these changes into the published materials, but he did make several comments on them. ''\"For a reason unknown to me, my father displaced the second King of Nargothrond and made him a member of the same family in the next generation; but this and associated genealogical changes were never incorporated in the narratives of The Silmarillion.\"''<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}, p. 255 note 20</ref> ''\"There can be no doubt that this was my father’s last word on the subject; but nothing of this late and radically altered conception ever touched the existing narratives, and it was obviously impossible to introduce it into the published Silmarillion. It would nonetheless have been very much better to have left Gil-galad’s parentage obscure.\"''<ref name=\"Galad\" />\n\n===A note from ''[[The Nature of Middle-earth]]''===\nHowever, in a very late note dated c. 1972-3, the name ''Orodreth'' is again mentioned in the list of some renowned heroes in the royal lines of old, so it seems that Tolkien abandoned the name ''Arothir'' (which was itself meant to replace ''Orodreth'' a few years earlier).<ref>{{NM|P2v}}, footnote, p. 189</ref>\n\n{{references|note}}\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n|race=noldor\n|house=[[House of Finarfin]]<small><br/>Cadet branch of [[House of Finwë]]</small>\n|born=After {{YT|1300}}\n|died={{FA|495}}\n}}\n{{seq\n|pvac=None\n|prev=Position established\n|list=Warden of [[Minas Tirith (Beleriand)|Minas Tirith]]\n|dates={{FA|102}} - {{FA|457|n}}\n|next=Minas Tirith captuted by [[Sauron|Gorthaur]]\n|nvac=None\n}}\n{{seq\n|prev=[[Finrod]]\n|list=2nd [[King of Nargothrond]]\n|dates={{FA|465}} – {{FA|495|n}}\n|next=[[Fall of Nargothrond|Kingdom destroyed]]\n|nvac=None\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n\n[[Category:Calaquendi]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Children of Húrin]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Gnomish names]]\n[[Category:House of Finarfin]]\n[[Category:Noldor]]\n[[Category:Noldorin names]]\n[[Category:Rulers in Beleriand]]\n[[Category:Rulers in the Great Lands]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n\n[[de:Orodreth (Elb)]]\n[[fi:Orodreth]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/elfes/noldor/orodreth]]"}}}
