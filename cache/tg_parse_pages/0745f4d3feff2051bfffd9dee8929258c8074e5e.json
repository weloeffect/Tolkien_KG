Tolkien]], published in [[1922]]. \n\nIt was intended to be published together with [[Kenneth Sisam]]'s ''[[Fourteenth Century Verse & Prose]]'' in [[1921]], but it was not finished in time, so it was published separately in [[1922]], which became Tolkien's first published book.\n\nThe ''Vocabulary'' contains some 4,740 entries with nearly 6,800 definitions, running to 167 pages.<ref name=a>[[Wayne G. Hammond]], [[Christina Scull]] (2006), ''[[The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide]]''</ref>\n\n==Appearance==\n''A Middle English Vocabulary'' was published on [[11 May|May 11]], [[1922]], to be a supplement to Sisam's ''Verse & Prose'' published the year before.<ref name=\"Biblio\">[[Douglas A. Anderson]], [[Wayne G. Hammond]] (eds.), ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography]]'', \"Books by J. R. R. Tolkien\", pages 1-3</ref> The separate binding is unpaged, and titled \"Glossary\", rather than \"Vocabulary\", on the title page.<ref name=\"Lee\">Margaret L. Lee, \"Middle English\", published in ''[[The Year's Work in English Studies]]'', vol II (1922), pages 41-53, esp. 42-3</ref>\n\n==Publication==\nSisam was Tolkien's old tutor of English Language and Literature, and also involved the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', working on several words under the letter ''S''.<ref>[[Peter Gilliver]], [[Jeremy Marshall]], [[Edmund Weiner]], ''[[The Ring of Words]]'', page 3</ref> After that section was published, Oxford University Press asked him to write a compilation of fourteenth century verse and prose. By 1919, it turned out Sisam did not have time to compile the glossary, so Tolkien was asked to do it. The project, originally planned to be little else than a glossary, quickly became a much larger work. Tolkien was given time off from his regular work on the OED, and even continued working on the glossary after his transfer to [[Leeds University]].<ref name=\"Ring\">[[Peter Gilliver]], [[Jeremy Marshall]], [[Edmund Weiner]], ''[[The Ring of Words]]'', page 32-3</ref> The publication had been delayed due to private matters, and Tolkien was glad when it was finally finished. Sisam's book was, in the end, published without the glossary.<ref name=\"L6\">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Humphrey Carpenter]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (eds.), ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', [[Letter 6]] (dated [[13 February|February 13]], [[1923]])</ref> Later editions of Sisam's book did include Tolkien's glossary.<ref name=\"Biblio\"/>\n\n==Method==\nTolkien gained praise for his glossary, which was unlike most others. Whereas it was a trend of the days to suggest (often questionable) etymologies of rare and obscure words, Tolkien chose to devote his time to the different meanings of common words, such as ''to'', ''he'' and ''habben'' (\"to have\"). His Vocabulary is filled with textual references,<ref name=\"Lee\"/> and much of his findings elaborated on the OED, pre-dating words by sometimes a century. Some of these suggestions were taken into account in later editions of the OED.<ref name=\"Ring\"/>\n\n==Reviews==\n* 1922: Margaret L.
