''Celbin'') was a term used amongst [[Sindar]] that lived in [[Beleriand]]. It was used of all [[Elves]] other than [[Avari]], and it included the Sindar themselves (who specifically called themselves ''[[Edhil]]''). The term was thus equivalent to the [[Quenya]] word \"''[[Eldar]]''\". After the [[Laegrim]] were recognized to be from [[Lindar]]in origin, they were included in ''Celbin''. \n\nUnlike the Quenya form ''[[Calaquendi|Calaquende]]'', this word does not exclusively refer to Elves, but includes other forces in alliance against [[Morgoth]], e. g. the [[Edain]] were included in this category.\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Calben'', 'a light person' is composed from the [[Sindarin]] words ''[[calad|cal]]'' \"light\" and ''[[pen]]'' \"someone, somebody\". It is connected to the terms derived from Kala-kwendē, but is itself derived from a variant form with ''-kwen'', as it never shows a variant form ''Calbend''.\n==Cognates==\n*[[Telerin]] ''[[Calapendi]]''\n*[[Quenya]] ''[[Calaquendi]]'' but used in a different context.\n\n== Sources ==\n* [[The War of the Jewels]], p.&nbsp;362; 376-377; 380; 408-409.\n\n[[Category:Elves]]\n[[Category:Sindarin demonyms]]\n[[fi:Calben]]"}}}
