Hooker]], illustrated by [[James Dunning]].\n\n==Reception==\n\n[[John D. Rateliff]], in his review of ''The Hobbitonian Anthology'' in ''[[Tolkien Studies (journal)|Tolkien Studies]]'', praises Hooker for being a \"indefatigable researcher\". However, the review is largely negative, and Rateliff's main criticism concerns the alleged tendency in the book to make too bold claims about etymological links between Tolkien's invented names and possible real-world sources.<ref>[[John D. Rateliff]], \"Review of ''The Hobbitonian Anthology''\", in {{TS|7}}, pp. 330-5</ref> Mark T. Hooker responded to the review, and to the editors of ''Tolkien Studies'', in an \"Open Letter\", stating that Rateliff is an \"unqualified reviewer\" and criticizes him for making a number of wrong conclusions about the book.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Mark T.

Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s \"[[The Lord of the Rings]]\" and \"[[The Hobbit]],\" written by Tolkien scholar and Comparative Translationist [[Mark T. Hooker]], most famous, perhaps, for his application of Comparative Translation to the study of Tolkien. \n\nThe collection is a miscellany, but largely linguistic in nature. \n* Part One of the book is about names: [[Bilbo Baggins]], [[Bag End]], [[Boffin Family|Boffin]], [[Farmer Maggot]], [[Puddifoot Family|Puddifoot]], [[Stoors|Stoor]], [[William|Huggins]], [[Tom Bombadil]], [[Ivy Bush|The Ivy Bush]], [[The Golden Perch]], and a bevy of place names, including the [[Four Shire Stone]] and the Rollright Stones in the neighborhood of [[Evesham]], the ancestral home of Tolkien’s mother’s family, the [[Mabel Suffield|Suffield]]s. The articles in Part One discuss the meanings of these names and their English analogues, both from a linguistic, a geographic, and biographic viewpoint. \n* The articles in Part Two explore the terms bootless, nine days’ wonder, [[Uncommon words|confusticate]] and bebother, [[Uncommon words|hundredweight]], and [[Uncommon words|leechcraft]]. \n* In Part Three, Hooker continues his work in translation studies, looking at the Bulgarian, Belorussian, Czech, Slovak, Dutch, German, Polish, Russian, Serbian, and Ukrainian translations of \"The Hobbit\" with a series of comparative pieces on how the translators handled Tolkien’s nomenclature.\n* Part Four is an examination of the Russian translations of \"[[Leaf by Niggle]].\"\n\n==External links==\n* '''[http://llyfrawr.com/Hobbitonian/hobbitonian.html Official website]'''\n\n{{References}}\n{{title|italics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hobbitonian Anthology, The}}\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
