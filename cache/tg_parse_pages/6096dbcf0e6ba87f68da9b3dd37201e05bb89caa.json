The Morannon was the only pass through Mordor's outer mountain chains through which large armies could easily move, but apparently small amounts of troops were able to slowly funnel through the Morgul Pass. However, the Pass of Cirith Ungol was extremely inaccessible, involving climbing up or down the section called the [[Straight Stair]], and then the [[Winding Stair]], making it practically impossible for easy travel of large numbers of troops, much less horses and wagons.<ref>{{TT|IV8}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nOn [[10 March]] {{TA|3019}}, [[Frodo Baggins]], [[Samwise Gamgee]], and [[Gollum]] began their ascent of the stairs to [[Shelob's Lair]]. The hobbits, abandoned by Gollum, entered the lair on [[12 March]] and Frodo was captured by [[Orcs]] the next day. On [[14 March]], Sam helped Frodo to escape from the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]] and thus they completed their harrowing passage of the Ephel Dúath.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Ephel Dúath'' (pron. {{IPA|[ˈefːel ˈduˑ.aθ]}}) is a [[Sindarin]] name. It means \"Fence of shadow\" and is a compound of ''[[ephel]]'' (\"encircling ring or fence\") and ''[[dúath]]'' (\"dark shadow\").<ref>{{HM|UI}}, p. 457</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ephel Duath}}\n[[Category:Mountain ranges]]\n[[Category:Mordor]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[de:Ephel Dúath]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/reliefs/mordor/ephel duath]]\n[[fi:Ephel Dúath]]"}}}
