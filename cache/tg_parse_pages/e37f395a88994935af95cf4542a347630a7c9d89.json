Tolkien]]'s stories. It is published as No. 20 in the ''[[Cormarë Series]]''.\n\n==From the publisher==\n\n{{blockquote|From the Grand Theme that the Ainur played before Ilúvatar at the beginning of the world, to the various songs encountered or sung by the characters of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, the world that J.R.R. Tolkien created contains numerous references to song and music. Indeed, musical elements form an integral part of his narratives. It is therefore surprising that, until now, discussion of this aspect of Tolkien's sub-creation has been sparse in secondary literature. The 14 papers presented in this volume set out to address this important gap.<br/><br/>Besides musical references found in Tolkien's own works, the scope of Middle-earth music has over the years been further extended by various attempts to either set Tolkien's song texts to music, or to create derivative musical works. Such creations range from the songs and music of the various films and radio adaptions to such phenomena as Tolkien-inspired Black Metal. Besides the musical refences found in Tolkien's own writings, this volume also looks at these works.}}\n\n==Contents==\n* '''Foreword'''\n* '''Part A: Creation and Music'''\n** \"Behold Your Music!\": The Themes of Ilúvatar, the Song of Aslan, and the Real Music of the Spheres\n*** By: [[Kristine Larsen]]\n** Tonality, Atonality and the Ainulindalë\n*** By: Reuven Naveh\n** Ainulindalë: Tolkien, St. Thomas, and the Metaphysics of the Music\n*** By: Jonathan McIntosh\n* '''Part B: Music in Tolkien's World'''\n** A Speculative History of the Music of Arda\n*** By: Steven Linden\n** \"Bring Out the Instruments!\": Instrumental Music in Middle-earth\n*** By: Heidi Steimel\n** The Harp in Middle-earth\n*** By: Norbert Maier (translated from German by Heidi Steimel)\n* '''Part C: Influences of Our World on Tolkien's Music'''\n** Music, Myth, and Literary Depth in the \"Land ohne Musik\"\n*** By: Gregory Martin\n** Strains of Elvish Song and Voices: Victorian Medievalism, Music, and Tolkien\n*** By: [[Bradford Lee Eden]]\n** Sleeps a Song in Things Abounding: J.R.R.
