In the aftermath of one such dive, his father, [[Elendil]], observes that he seems to have grown drastically and tells Herendil that he has the makings of a fine man.<ref name=P1/>\n\nTo this, Herendil rebukes his father, believing the comment to be one of mockery, claiming that Elendil knew already that he was of a lesser height than others of his age, and that he was tormented by that. Herendil stated in evidence that he was barely of height to [[Almáriel]]'s shoulder.<ref name=P1/>\n\nHerendil then informed his father that though the two of them are the blood of kings, his peers called him names such as \"Terendul\" the day prior, and accused him of being a \"half-Noldo.\" Herendil admitted, however, that it is at least better than \"being called half a Gnome\".<ref name=P1/>\n\nElendil responded saying that then it may be dangerous for Herendil to be his son as his own father's name, [[Valandil (The Lost Road)|Valandil]], meant ''\"God-friend\"''.<ref name=P1>{{LR|P1III2}}, pp. 59-61</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Herendil'' is [[Quenya]], being a compound of ''heren'' (\"fortune, governance\") + ''(-n)dil'' (\"friend\"). Its [[Old English]] cognate was ''[[Eadwine]]''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries \"KHER-\", \"NIL-, NDIL-\"</ref> which means \"Fortune-friend\".<ref>{{LR|P1III1}}, Chapter II: ''Alboin and Audoin'', p. 46</ref>\n\nThe derisive name, ''Terendul'', meaning \"slender and dark\",<ref name=P1/> contains the elements ''teren'' (\"slender\") + ''nulla'' (\"dark, dusky, obscure\").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries \"TER-, TERES-\", \"NDUL-\"</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nIn an earlier draft of ''[[The Lost Road]]'', Herendil was called ''[[Eärendil|Eärendel]]'' in scorn or mockery by a [[Men|man]] named [[Poldor]] rather than being called ''Terendul'' by anonymous peers.<ref>{{LR|P1III2}}, p. 70, note 5</ref>\n\nTolkien eventually abandoned his work ''[[The Lost Road]]'', yet many elements of Herendil were merged into the character of '''[[Isildur]]''' within ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.{{Fact}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Almáriel]]\n* [[Poldor]]\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:The Lost Road]]\n[[Category:Men]]\n[[Category:Númenóreans]]\n[[Category:Quenya names]]"}}}
