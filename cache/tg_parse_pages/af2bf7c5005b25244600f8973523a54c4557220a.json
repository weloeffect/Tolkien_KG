During the siege proper he fights on the walls of the First Circle alongside other Lords of [[Gondor]]. After the battle is won, he is found right outside the city gates next to [[Imrahil]] and tasks the player with quenching the remaining fires and burying those who died fighting within the First Circle. He stands behind Steward Faramir during the coronation of King Elessar.\n\n{{references}}\n{{title}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hurin Warden of the Keys}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:Dúnedain]]\n[[Category:Gondorians]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n\n[[de:Húrin der Kühne]]\n[[fi:Húrin Pitkä]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/hommes/3a/dunedain/gondoriens/hurin des clefs]]"}}}
