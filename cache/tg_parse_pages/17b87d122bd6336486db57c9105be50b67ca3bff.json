It was reprinted in ''[[The Return of the Shadow]]''.<ref>{{RS|1VIIIS2}} (pp. 145-7)</ref> \n\nTolkien eventually used it as the basis for a poem recited by [[Frodo Baggins]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and published it as ''The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late'' in ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]''.<ref>{{AB|Preface}}</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\n[[Tom Shippey]] noted some elements on the Indo-European myth of [[Wikipedia:Phaethon|Phaethon]] in the [[Man in the Moon]]'s horses.<ref>[[Tom Shippey]] ([[1982]]), ''[[The Road to Middle-Earth]]'' (Third ed.), [[HarperCollins]], pp. 41–42.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Tom Shippey]] and Thomas Honneger, the poem attempts to retroactively add depth to the anonymous nonsensical nursery rhyme; the \"surviving\" rhyme could be imagined as an artifact of that larger surviving rhyme from the [[Third Age]].<ref>[[Tom Shippey]] ([[1982]]), ''[[The Road to Middle-Earth]]'' (Third ed.), [[HarperCollins]], pp. 41–42.</ref><ref>Thomas Honneger ([[2005]]) \"The Man in the Moon: Structural Depth in Tolkien\", ''[[Root and Branch - Approaches towards Understanding Tolkien]]'' (2nd ed.), [[Walking Tree Publishers]], pp. 9-58</ref>\n\n[[George MacDonald]] had composed ''The True History of the Cat and the Fiddle'' (published in ''[[Wikipedia:At the Back of the North Wind|At the Back of the North Wind]]'') in which he combined the nursery rhymes ''Hey Diddle Diddle'' and ''The Man in the Moon Came Down Too Soon''. George Burke Johnston suggested that Tolkien was inspired by that poem.<ref>{{AB|Comm}}</ref>\n\nSteven M. Deyo says the poem is based on the \"Harley manuscript poem 2253\".<ref>Steven M.

Tolkien\", [[Mythlore 12]] (3), Article 8</ref>\n\n==Portrayals in adaptations==\n'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''\n:Frodo sings an abridged version of the song at the Prancing Pony before falling off the table and accidentally slipping on the [[One Ring|Ring]] for the first time, causing him to disappear and startle the patrons.\n\n'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''\n:Frodo sings the song in Bree.

The line fragment ''\"And there they brew a beer so brown\"'' was changed to ''\"And there they '''make''' a '''stew''' so brown\"'', presumably to censor references to alcohol. The [[Man in the Moon]] is said to have \"flew down\" rather than \"c[o]me down\" and he \"eat\"s his fill, rather than \"drink\"s his fill.\n\n'''2006: [[The Lord of the Rings Musical|''The Lord of the Rings'' (musical)]]:'''\n:The hobbits sing a version at the Prancing Pony.
