See {{MR|P2e}}, p. 75</ref> At this time, the East Sea was narrowest in the extreme north and south of the world, where only small straits filled with ice separated Middle-earth and the Land of the Sun. These straits connected the East Sea to [[Ekkaia]], the Outer Sea.<ref name=\"A4\" />\n\nDuring the Battle of the Powers between the [[Valar]] and [[Melkor]], the East Sea became connected to Belegaer. The inland [[Sea of Ringil]], originally set in the mid-south of Middle-earth, grew in size and \"became a great sea flowing north-eastward and joining by straights both the Western and Eastern Seas.\"<ref group=\"note\">Confusingly, the former Sea of Ringil was also called the \"East Sea\" by Tolkien on one early map. See {{SM|A5}}.</ref><ref name=\"Fashion\" />{{rp|293–4}}\n\nAfter Melkor defiled the [[Two Trees of Valinor]], the Valar used the fruit of [[Laurelin]] to create the [[Sun]] and the flower of [[Telperion]] to create the [[Moon]].<ref name=\"S11\">{{S|11}}</ref> In the evenings, the Sun set in the [[Outer Sea]] to the west of Aman, where it was pulled down by [[Ulmo]]'s servants and sent under the earth<ref name=\"S11\" /> to the East Sea, where it rose at dawn.<ref>{{App|D2}} (\"Later [the Númenóreans] also made their week one of 7 days, and they reckoned the day from sunrise (out of the eastern sea) to sunrise.\")</ref> The Moon followed the Sun on this path.<ref name=\"S11\" />\n\nIn the [[Second Age]], the [[Númenóreans]] sailed about Middle-earth to the [[uttermost east]]<ref>{{L|131}}(\"[The Númenóreans] sail[ed] to the uttermost north, and south, and east.\")</ref> and could see the [[Gates of Morning]] from their ships,<ref name=\"S\">{{S|IV}}</ref> suggesting that they sailed into the East Sea. It was also in this age that a final change was made to the earth that likely affected the East Sea: when [[Ilúvatar]] sank Númenor and made the world round, he \"cast back ... the [[Empty Lands]] east of [Middle-earth], and new lands and seas were made\".<ref name=\"S\" /> How this impacted the geography of the East Sea is unknown.\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]'', the Uttermost East ([[Oronto]]) was connected to the [[Middle-earth|Great Lands]], directly east of [[Palisor]], with no separating water. [[Oromë]] described the East to the [[Valar]], saying that \"''there is a silent beach and dark empty seas''\". It is also told that [[Aulë]] and [[Ulmo]] \"''builded great havens'' [of the Sun and Moon] ''beside the soundless sea''\".<ref>{{LT1|IX}}</ref><ref>{{SM|5e}}</ref>\n\nIn early texts, [[Hildórien]] - the site where the first [[Men]] awoke in the [[First Age]] - was placed in the central region of Middle-earth near the shore of the East Sea. Hildórien was surrounded by the [[Mountains of the Wind]], a semi-circular mountain chain that derived its named from the strong winds that blew into them from over the East Sea due to the rising of the Sun.<ref name=\"A4\" /><ref name=\"Fashion\" />{{rp|293}} In later texts, Hildórien is said to be \"in the midmost parts of Middle-earth\" with no mention of the East Sea or the Mountains of the Wind.<ref>{{WJ|9}}, p. 174</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Sea of Rhûn]]\n*[[Sea of Helcar]]\n*[[Sea of Ringil]]\n*[[Dark Land]]\n\n{{references|notes}}\n[[Category:Eastern lands]]\n[[Category:Seas and oceans]]"}}}
