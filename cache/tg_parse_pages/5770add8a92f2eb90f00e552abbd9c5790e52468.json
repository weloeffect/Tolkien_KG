The Dweller was invented for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'' by [[Amazon Studios]], where she is portrayed by [[Bridie Sisson]]. She appeared in the first and second seasons of the series.\n\n==History==\n[[File:The Rings of Power (TV series) - Mystics2.png|left|thumb|345x345px|The three Mystics.]]\nAt the command of the Dark wizard, the Dweller travelled west from [[Caras Gaer]] in [[Rhûn]] alongside two other [[Mystics]] known as [[The Nomad]] and [[The Ascetic]]. The three were in persuit of [[the Stranger]], whom they believed to be a reembodied [[Sauron]]. After the Stranger's meteoric fall, the Mystics came upon the smoldering crater where he had landed in [[Rhovanion]].\n\nThe Mystics trailed the Stranger and an accompanying band of [[Harfoots]] east to the place called the [[Grove]]. Amidst a patch of apple trees that had been renewed by the Stranger's [[magic]], [[Elanor Brandyfoot|Nori Brandyfoot]] attempted to cause a distraction to lead them away from the Stranger. Having been successfully distracted by Nori, the Dweller used her sorcery to set flame to the Harfoot caravan.\n\nUpon finding the Stranger in the [[Mirkwood|Greenwood]], the Mystics bowed to the Stranger and told him of his presumed identity as Sauron. The Stranger resisted this revelation and, once again utilizing her sorcery, the Dweller cast a spell to cause him to fall into a deep slumber. Realizing that a band of Harfoots were attempting to rescue the Stranger, the Dweller used her magic to adopt his likeness and lured them into a trap. \n[[File:The Rings of Power (TV series) - Mystics Defeated.png|left|thumb|367x367px|The Dweller (center) withering alongside the Nomad and the Ascetic from the onslaught of the Stranger's magic.]]\nThe Stranger then awoke from his slumber and engaged in a magical battle with the Mystics. Though he initially struggled, Nori managed to bring The Stranger the staff of the Dweller. Wielding her staff, he used his overwhelming magical power to reveal that, to the horror of the Mystics, he was not Sauron but was instead one of the [[Istari]]. The Mystics then withered and burst into a swarm of moths. \n\nLater, in [[Caras Gaer]], Dark Wizard resurrected the Dweller through a blood magic ritual and admonished her for not succeeding in capturing The Stranger. Her later fate is unknown.\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dweller, The}}\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) characters]]"}}}
