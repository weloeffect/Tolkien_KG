One notable kingfisher lived, according to [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] folklore, in the [[Old Forest]]. It jestfully harassed [[Tom Bombadil]], who in return compared it to a weathercock, and commented that, despite its lordy appearance, it lives in a dirty home.<ref group=note>These scolds refer to the superstition that \"if a kingfisher skin is hung by the bill, it turns like a weathercock\"; and that a kingfisher home is \"a chamber tunnelled into a sandy bank and lined with disgorged fish bones and feces\" {{WP|Kingfisher}}</ref> Upon flying away it lost a bright blue feather which Tom took replacing the old battered [[Swans|swan]]-feather in his hat.<ref name=\"Boat\"/> Tom still bore a noticeable large blue feather on his hat when he met [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and his companions.<ref>{{FR|Forest}}</ref>\n\n[[Gondor]] was also familiar with the Kingfisher; when [[Faramir]] saw what he thought was a black squirrel or kingfisher, he asked [[Anborn]] whether there were any black kingfishers in [[Mirkwood]],<ref name=\"Pool\">{{TT|Pool}}</ref> a forest known for its black animals.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 480</ref> Anborn saw the mysterious creature had four limbs, and quickly dismissed both ideas. It turned out to be [[Gollum]], hiding in the [[Forbidden Pool]].<ref name=\"Pool\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Kingfishers'' were originally called ''the King's fisher'', as they, like [[swans]], were royal animals<ref name=\"L240\">{{L|240}}</ref> although the historical association is unknown.\n==Other names==\nSeveral [[Eldarin]] words for the bird are known as well: in [[Quenya]], it was called '''''halatir''''' (or ''halatir(no)''), from the [[Sundocarmë|roots]] [[SKAL]] and [[TIR]], literally meaning \"fishwatcher\".<ref name=Etym>{{LR|Etymologies}}, roots [[KHAL]], [[SKAL]] and [[TIR]]</ref> [[Noldorin]] had a similar word, '''''heledirn'''''.<ref name=Etym/>\n\n==Inspiration==\nThe Kingfisher, and especially the rivalry between the kingfisher and the [[Old Swan]] in ''[[Bombadil Goes Boating]]'', was inspired by its use in European royal houses. Originally, the swan was the animal owned by kings, but later, it became the kingfisher. In [[Middle-earth]], both yearned for the return of the [[Aragorn|rightful King]].<ref name=\"L240\"/> \n\n{{notes}}\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Birds]]"}}}
