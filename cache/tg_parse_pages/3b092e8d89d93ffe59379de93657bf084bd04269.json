He had yellow fangs and a black [[Knives|knife]]<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite DTP|id=LR 3.03.008}}</ref> with a long sharp<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite DTP|id=LR 3.03.032}}</ref> steel<ref>{{Cite DTP|id=LR 3.03.031}}</ref> blade, jugged like a saw-edge.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n==History==\nTwo or more orc were guarding the captured [[hobbits]]. These orcs spoke with each other in [[Orkish|their own tongue,]] but used [[Westron|Common Speech]] when talking to Pippin. The yellow-fanged guard threatened Pippin with this knife.<ref name=\":1\" /> He also cursed the [[Orcs of Isengard|Isengarders]] and their leader [[Uglúk]] both in [[Westron|Common Speech]] and in a debased form of [[Black Speech]].<ref name=\":1\" /><sup>,</sup><ref name=\":3\">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Appendix F]], \"The Languages and Peoples of the Third Age\", \"Of Other Races\"</ref> [[Uglúk u bagronk sha pushdug Saruman-glob búbhosh skai|His curse]] is one  of the two known phrases in Black Speech.\n\nSoon a quarrel arose among the orcs about their future route and the fate of the prisoners.<ref>{{Cite DTP|id=LR 3.03.010}}</ref> The yellow-fanged guard joined the fray<ref>{{Cite DTP|id=LR 3.03.028}}</ref> and was cut down by broad-bladed swords of the followers of Uglúk.<ref name=\":0\" /> His body fell on top of Pippin,<ref name=\":0\" /> who managed to cut the ropes tying his arms using the knife that the orc still held in his dead hand.<ref name=\":2\" /> Four more orcs were slain by Uglúk<ref name=\":0\" /> and other Isengarders<ref name=\":2\" /> during that quarrel.\n\n==Origin==\nIt is unclear whether the yellow-fanged guard was a [[Orcs of Mordor|Mordor Orc]] or an [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains|Orc of the Misty Mountains]]. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] himself in the [[Appendix F]] identified him as \"the Mordor-orc\" and as a soldier of the [[Barad-dûr|Dark Tower]] whose captain was [[Grishnákh]].<ref name=\":3\" /> On the other hand, [[Aragorn]] called some or all of the five orcs slain in that quarrel \"Northern Orcs from far away\".<ref>{{Cite DTP|id=LR 3.02.011}}</ref> However, considering that the Fellowship previously encountered black [[Uruk-hai|Uruks]] of [[Mordor]] in [[Moria]],<ref>{{Cite DTP|id=LR 2.05.028}}</ref> both of these statements may be true in the same time.\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Orcs]]"}}}
