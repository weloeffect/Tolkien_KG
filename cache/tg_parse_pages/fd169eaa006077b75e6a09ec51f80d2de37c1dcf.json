Tolkien]].\n==From the publisher==\n{{blockquote|Riddles have lost none of their power over us: we are as fascinated by mysteries, from sudoko to whodunnits, from jokes to philosophical conundrums. ''The Hobbit'' is a book threaded through with riddles; most obviously in its central 'Riddles in the Dark' chapter, but everywhere else too—what does 'Good Morning' mean? What is a burrahobbit? How many versions of the Hobbit are there? What is the buried secret in the nine riddles Bilbo and Gollum swap between one another? What are Ents? Dragons? Wizards? What is the magic of the magic ring? All these questions, and more, are answered in ''The Riddles of The Hobbit'', the first critical engagement with Tolkien's great novel to take 'the riddle' seriously as a key structuring principle of the novel. Riddles are more than a diverting pastime; they are expressive and beguiling rebuses that touch on larger mysteries, powerful questions and paradoxes also embodied in the Catholicism that informed so much of Tolkien's imaginative life. Ringing widely across Tolkien's creative life, ''The Riddles of The Hobbit'' explores the importance of riddles to the Anglo Saxon and Norse cultures that inspired him, and discusses scores of riddles offering (usually) more than one answer for each. This is a critical study of the playful aspect of a great writer that takes his playfulness seriously; it explores and embodies ingenuity; and comes to some original and—on occasion—startling new conclusions.Adam Roberts is Professor of Nineteenth-century Literature at Royal Holloway, University of London, UK. He is also the author of more than a dozen science fiction novels: his most recent, ''Jack Glass'' (2012) won the BSFA and Campbell awards for the year's best science fiction novel. He has published a number of critical and academic works on science fiction, 19th-century and other topics.}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/press/1106-the-riddles-of-the-hobbit.php ''The Riddles of The Hobbit'' by Adam Roberts] at [[Tolkien Library]]\n*[http://mythoi.tolkienindex.net/#post11 ''The Riddles of The Hobbit'' by Adam Roberts], review by [[Morgan Thomsen]]\n\n{{title|italics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Riddles of The Hobbit, The}}\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]"}}}
