Tolkien]], written during [[1945]] and published posthumously as the second part of ''[[Sauron Defeated]]'', the 9th volume of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''. It is a space/time/dream travel story, written at the same time as ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' was being developed. \n\n==Contents==\n* [[Foreword and List of Members]]\n* [[The Notion Club Papers Part One|''The Notion Club Papers'' Part One]]\n* [[The Notion Club Papers Part Two|''The Notion Club Papers'' Part Two]]\n* [[Major Divergences in Earlier Versions of Part Two]]\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Title-page of The Notion Club Papers.jpg|thumb|left|Title-page of ''Leaves From The Notion Club Papers Edited By Howard Green Second Edition'' by J.R.R. Tolkien]]\nThe story itself involves the minutes of the meetings of an arts discussion club at [[Oxford]], a fictionalization of (and a pun on) Tolkien's own Club, [[Inklings|The Inklings]]. During these meetings, [[Alwin Arundel Lowdham]] discusses his [[Atlantis-haunting|lucid dreams]] about \"[[Wikipedia:Atlantis|Atlantis]]\"; through these dreams, he \"discovers\" much about the [[Númenor]] story and the languages of the [[Elder Days]] (notably [[Quenya]], [[Sindarin]], and [[Adûnaic]] &mdash; the last very interesting since it is the sole source of most of the material on this language). While not finished, at the end of the given story it becomes clear Lowdham himself is a reincarnation of sorts of [[Elendil]]. (''Alwin'' is a modernisation of the name ''[[Ælfwine]]'', Old English for Elf-friend, or ''Elendil'' in Quenya.)  Other members of the Club also mention their vivid dreams of other times and places. \n\nTolkien not only created fictional meetings for these papers; he also created a fictional history for the manuscript of the papers. According to the papers, the meetings occurred in the 1980s; they even mention events that occurred in the 1970s and 1980s. About one-fourth of the papers were found among sacks of waste paper in 2012 at Oxford by a [[Howard Green|Mr. Howard Green]]. Mr. Green published a first edition containing excerpts from these papers, indicating that they were written during the 1980s by one of the participants. Two scholars read the first edition, asked to examine the manuscripts, and then submitted a full report. The \"Notes to the Second Edition\" mentions the contradictory evidence in dating the manuscripts, and an alternative date is presented: they may have been written in the 1940s.\n\n==Commentary==\nThese papers remind one of [[C.S. Lewis]]' commentary to Tolkien's poem ''[[Lay of Leithian]]'', in which Lewis created a fictional history of scholarship of the poem and even referred to other manuscript traditions to recommend changes to the poem.\n\n''The Notion Club Papers'' may be seen as an attempt to re-write ''[[The Lost Road]]'', published and discussed in ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]'', as being another attempt to tie the Númenórean legend in with a more modern tale.  There is, however, no direct connection between the modern settings of the two stories within the fictional frame.\n\n==Inspiration==\nDr. Bruce Charlton has suggested that the supernatural character of the story shows a direct or indirect influence by [[Charles Williams]], who wrote those kind of novels: the mythical affecting modern everyday life.<ref>{{webcite|author=Bruce Charlton |articleurl=http://notionclubpapers.blogspot.com/2010/11/notion-club-papers-are-tolkiens-charles.html|articlename=The Notion Club Papers are Tolkien's Charles Williams novel|dated=5 November 2010|website=[http://notionclubpapers.blogspot.com/ The Notion Club Papers - an Inklings blog]|accessed=18 February 2021}}</ref>\n\nThe narration includes a mention of a \"mechanical nightingale\"; it has been suggested that this is a reference to [[Wikipedia:Hans Christian Andersen|Hans Christian Andersen]]'s story \"[http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/nightingale/index.html The Nightingale]\". Andersen was inspired to write the story after having been infatuated with the singer [[Wikipedia:Jenny Lind|Jenny Lind]] (often called \"the Swedish Nightingale\").<ref>{{webcite|author='Talelmarhazad' |articleurl=http://greyhavensgroup.wordpress.com/2012/05/21/tolkiens-mechanical-nightingale/|articlename=Tolkien’s Mechanical Nightingale|dated=21 May 2012|website=[http://greyhavensgroup.wordpress.com/ The Grey Havens Group]|accessed=21 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Trivia==\nBy an odd coincidence ''The Notion Club Papers'' mentions a great storm occurring during 1987 in England. In real life the [[Wikipedia:Great Storm of 1987|Great Storm of 1987]] occurred in October of that year.\n\n==External links==\n*{{webcite|author=Bruce G.
