Eriol decides it is time to seek lodging just as the sun has begun to set and the first stars appear in the sky. At the summit of a hill he turns down a winding lane and on the western slope he spots a tiny dwelling, this is the [[Cottage of Lost Play]].\n\nThere he meets [[Lindo]] and [[Vairë]], who built the cottage long years ago, and now care for the many lost children of men that have remain in [[Kôr]] with the [[Eldar]] for ever. From them Eriol learns of the foundation of [[Kortirion]] and some small parts of the history of the Eldar.\n\nMany great events are mentioned here but not explained in detail; the [[Faring Forth]], the Exiles of Kôr, the [[Valar]] and [[Valinor]].\nThe story ends with Vairë suggesting that Eriol may be a descendant of one that had ''\"found the rocks of Eldamar in those old days\"''.\n\n==Commentary==\nThe story is recorded in a High School Exercise Book labelled ''The Cottage of Lost Play, which intoduceth [the] Book of Lost Tales'' and was written out by [[Edith Tolkien]], being a fair copy of the original pencil manuscript likely written in the winter of [[1916]]-[[1917|17]].\n\nEriol is described as a ''\"Son of Eärendel\"'' but this is not to say that he is a descendant of [[Eärendel]]; if a beam from the star of Eärendel falls on a new-born child he is considered a “child of Eärendel“ and becomes a restless wanderer.\n\nAlongside this notebook is a small pocket-book labelled as ''Story of Eriol’s life'' which amongst other things explains his genealogy. He traces his descent from the god Woden. At the time of visiting Tol Eressëa has two sons, named [[Hengest and Horsa]], they are from his first wife Cwén who had died of unknown cause shortly before Eriol’s journey to find the Lonely Island.\n\nEriol is said to have come from ''\"the lands East of the North Sea\"'' which certainly refers to an area of the Danish peninsula according to [[Christopher Tolkien]]. It also indicates that Eriol appears to belong to a period preceding the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain.\n\n==Poems==\nThe four poems published at the end of this chapter are gradual revisions of the same work over a period of almost half a century.\n* ''[[The Little House of Lost Play: Mar Vanwa Tyaliéva|You and Me / and the Cottage of Lost Play]]'' (first version written in [[April]] [[1915]])\n* ''The Little House of Lost Play / Mar Vanwa Tyaliéva'' (the final revision from [[April]] [[1915]])\n* ''Kortirion among the Trees'' (written sometime pre-[[1937]])\n* ''[[The Trees of Kortirion]]'' (written in [[1962]])\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cottage of Lost Play}}"}}}
