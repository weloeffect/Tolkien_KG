Tolkien]] between [[1920]] and [[1943]] for his children, from [[Father Christmas]].\n\nIt was posthumously released on [[2 September]] [[1976]], the third anniversary of Tolkien's death, and was edited by [[Baillie Tolkien]], the wife of [[Christopher Tolkien]].\n\nHere it transcribes these letters and reproduces them, along with their envelopes, in facsimile. Many of these envelopes have Tolkien's hand-drawn stamps on them, and many letters are accompanied with full-page artwork. The work is warmly received by critics, and it has been suggested that some elements were carried over to the [[legendarium]].\n\n==Overview==\nThe stories are told in the form of letters, primarily written by Father Christmas, with letters or parts of letters written by the [[North Polar Bear]] and his Elven secretary [[Ilbereth]]. The letters document the adventures and misadventures of Father Christmas and his helpers, including the accident-prone North Polar Bear and nephews, [[Paksu]] and [[Valkotukka]]. Many letters include illustrations drawn by Father Christmas.<ref>{{LFC|Intro}}</ref>\n\nThe letters themselves were written over over 20 years to entertain Tolkien's children each Christmas. The first letter was written in [[1920]] when Tolkien's oldest son, [[John Tolkien|John]], was three years old, after he'd asked about Father Christmas and where he lived.<ref>{{LFC|1920}}</ref> Each letter included including North Pole stamps and postage marks designed by Tolkien.\n\n==Publication==\nThe first edition was published by [[Allen & Unwin]], under the name ''The Father Christmas Letters'', on [[2 September]] [[1976]], three years after Tolkien's death. Artwork from The Letters from ''The Father Christmas Letters'' were first displayed in [[1976]]-[[1976]] at the Ashmolean Museum to mark the release of the book.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Dimitra Fimi]]|articleurl=https://dimitrafimi.com/2021/06/02/surprises-and-discoveries-in-the-drawings-by-tolkien-exhibition-catalogue-1976/|articlename=Surprises and Discoveries in the Drawings by Tolkien exhibition catalogue (1976)|dated=|website=[https://dimitrafimi.com/ Dimitrafimi.com]|accessed=17 March 2024}}</ref> The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition was released later that year on [[19 October]].\n\nThe book was revised in [[1999]] and was retitled ''Letters from Father Christmas'', this edition included some more letters and artwork not published previously. So did the [[2012]]'s, [[2019]]'s, and subsequent editions. For a detailed comparison of contents between editions, see [https://www.tolkienguide.com/modules/wiwimod/index.php?page=Letters%20From%20Father%20Christmas this review].\n\n==Reception==\nThe reception to the original publication of ''The Father Christmas Letters'' was received very positively though Judith A. Johnson, in her book ''J.R.R. Tolkien: Six Decades of Criticism'' has suggested that this may have been partly due to Tolkien's recent death, noticing that the response to ''The Father Christmas Letters'' was much more measured and balanced.<ref>Judith A. Johnson, ''J.R.R. Tolkien: Six Decades of Criticism'', p. 133</ref>\n\nJessica Kemball-Cook suggested in her book ''Twentieth Century Children's Writers'' that it would become known as a classic of children's literature, while Nancy Willard for ''The New York Times Book Review'' also received the book positively, saying \"Father Christmas lives. And never more merrily than in these pages.\" In 2002, an article in ''The Independent on Sunday'' described the work as rivalling \"''The Lord of the Rings'' for sheer imaginative joy\".<!--This part is still copied from Wikipedia, going to leave it in till I find other reviews to replace it with.-->\n\n==Relation to the legendarium==\nWhile the ''Letters from Father Christmas'' are not part of Tolkien's legendarium, some shared elements can be noted:\n\n*Father Christmas' Elf-secretary [[Ilbereth]] (reminiscent of [[Elbereth Gilthoniel|Elbereth]]?){{Fact}}\n*glimpses of [[Elvish]] writing and the [[Goblin Alphabet]]\n*[[Arktik|\"Arctic\" Quenya]]\n*[[Man in the Moon]]\n\nKris Swank has discussed similarities between ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and the ''Letters from Father Christmas'', noting that they share a couple of story elements and that both works \"contain story elements which have common roots in Tolkien's early [[The Book of Lost Tales|Lost Tales]] and poems\".<ref>Kris Swank, \"[http://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-350791919/the-hobbit-and-the-father-christmas-letters ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Father Christmas Letters'']\", in [[Mythlore 123|''Mythlore'' 123]]</ref>\n\n==Publication history and gallery==\n;UK editions\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"125px\" heights=\"125px\">\nFile:Father Christmas 1976.png ‎|1976 hardcover first edition\nFile:Father Christmas 1978.png ‎|1978 paperback\nFile:Father Christmas 1990.png ‎|1993 paperback\nFile:Father Christmas 1995.png ‎|1995 hardcover\nFile:Father Christmas 1999.png ‎|1999 hardcover revised edition\nFile:Father Christmas 2004.jpeg |2004 hardcover & 2006 paperback\nFile:Father Christmas 2009.jpeg |2009 paperback\nFile:Father Christmas 2012.png |2012 hardcover\nFile:Father Christmas 2019.jpeg ‎|2019 hardcover deluxe edition\nFile:Father Christmas 2020.jpeg ‎|2020 hardcover centenary edition\nFile:Father Christmas 2023.jpeg |2023 hardcover\n</gallery>\n* [[Allen & Unwin|George Allen & Unwin]], hardcover ([[1976]]), pp.&nbsp;48.
