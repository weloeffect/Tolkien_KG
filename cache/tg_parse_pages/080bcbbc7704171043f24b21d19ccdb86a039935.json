In the game's storyline other Dwarves have been given that name and yet proved not to be the Father of the Longbeards returned, so a major part of his motivation is to prove whether he truly is or will be Durin VII.\n\n: At the onset of the [[War of the Ring]], Thorin III send Durin to the [[Iron Hills]] for his safety, where to his frustration the Prince had sat out the entire war in relative comfort. Seeking to prove himself, he follows a group of the [[Ironfists|Zhélruka]] dwarves on the pilgrimage to [[Ered Mithrin]], where they believe their old strongholds can be reclaimed following [[Sauron]]'s downfall. Despite his son disobeying his direct order, King Thorin puts his trust in him and sends to him both warriors from [[Erebor]] for reinforcements and the Red Axe of [[Dáin Ironfoot]].\n\n: The dwarves reclaim Skarháld, a fortress outpost of [[Dáin's hall]]s, but Durin sets his sights on a grander prize. Boosted by [[Longbeard]] reinforements coming from [[Eriador]] to [[Iron Hills]], Durin marches on [[Gundabad]] itself which is now ruled by Gorgar, son of [[Bolg]]. In summer of [[Third Age 3019|T.A. 3019]], the \"War of Three Peaks\" breaks out, in which the dwarves emerge victorious due to the [[orcs]] being undermined by both [[Angmar]]im cultists and the [[Hobgoblins]] from the North. Deep beneath Gundabad, Durin has an experience that causes him to remember his previous lives and confidently assert himself as Durin the Deathless returned.\n\n{{references|n}}\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n| race=dwarf\n| house=[[Durin's Folk|House of Durin]]\n| born=After {{FoA|171}}\n| died=\n}}\n{{seq\n| pvac=Unknown\n| prev=Last known:<br/>[[Thorin Stonehelm|Thorin III Stonehelm]]\n| prow=2\n| list=[[Kings of Durin's Folk|King of Durin's Folk]]\n| dates=After {{FoA|171}}\n| next=Unknown\n| nrow=2\n}}\n{{seq\n| list=[[Kings of Khazad-dûm|King of Khazad-dûm]]\n| dates=After {{FoA|171}}\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n\n{{durinskings}}\n[[Category:Dwarves]]\n[[Category:Dwarven names]]\n[[Category:Fourth Age characters]]\n[[Category:Kings of Durin's Folk]]\n[[Category:Kings of Khazad-dûm]]\n[[Category:Longbeards]]\n[[Category:Norse names]]\n[[de:Durin VII.]]\n[[fr:encyclo:personnages:nains:4a:durin vii]]\n[[fi:Durin VII]]"}}}
