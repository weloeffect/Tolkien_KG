Tolkien: Author of the Century''''' is a scholarly study of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and his work by [[Tom Shippey|Professor Tom Shippey]]. The book was also published in an American edition: Boston: Houghton Mifflin, [March] 2001. ISBN 0-618-12764-X (hbk).<ref>[[Åke Bertenstam]], ''[http://www.forodrim.org/bibliography/tolklist.html A Chronological Bibliography of Books about Tolkien]'', as of 20 August 2010</ref>\n==From the publisher==\n{{blockquote|Recent polls have consistently declared that J.R.R. Tolkien is \"the most influential author of the century\" and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' is \"the book of the century.\" In support of these claims, Tom Shippey, the prominent medievalist and scholar of fantasy, now presents us with a fascinating companion to the works of J.R.R. Tolkien, focusing in particular on ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings'', and ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.<br/><br/>The core of the book consists of three chapters that examine ''The Lord of the Rings'' as a linguistic and cultural map, as a twisted web of story, and as a response to the meaning of myth. Shippey presents a unique argument to explain the nature of evil and gives readers a compelling insight into the complicated interweaving of many strands as the narrative moves between characters and into the remarkable skill behind the construction of such a rich and complex story. Other chapters examine ''The Hobbit'', explaining the hobbits' anachronistic relationship to the heroic world of Middle-earth; the fundamental importance of ''The Silmarillion'' to Tolkien's canon; and an illuminating look at ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'', ''[[Leaf by Niggle]]'', and other lesser-known works in connection to Tolkien's life.<br/><br/>With a clear and accessible style, Shippey offers a new approach to Tolkien, to fantasy, and to the importance of language in literature. He demonstrates how ''The Hobbit'', ''The Lord of the Rings'', and ''The Silmarillion'' form part of a live and continuing tradition of storytelling that can trace its roots back through Grimms' ''Fairy Tales'' to ''[[Beowulf (poem)|Beowulf]]''. ''J.R.R. Tolkien: Author of the Century'' not only gives readers a deeper understanding of Tolkien and his work, but also serves as a learned and entertaining introduction to some of the finest and most influential works of fantasy ever written.}}\n{{references}}\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Books by Tom Shippey]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]\n[[de:J.R.R.
