Inside, [[Théoden]], [[Éowyn]] and [[Gríma]] listen to Gandalf's tidings. Théoden dismisses him, and calls him a herald of bad news. Gríma rebukes Gandalf, stating that he now counsels the King. \n\nAngered, Gandalf in turn rebukes Wormtongue. It is indeed Gríma to whom the King has been listening, and to no-one else. And Gríma has mislead Théoden by stating [[Rohan]] only survived because of the kindness of [[Saruman|Aruman]], and they should therefore let him be. Théoden interferes, saying that he is and always has been his own man, but before he can fully voice his discontent at seeking friendship with Aruman, Gríma cuts him off. As he confronts Gandalf, the Wizard reveals himself as Gandalf the White, and identifies Gríma as an agent of Aruman. He is cast down on the ground, but Théoden offers him his pity. He refuses, and runs away with a loud hiss. Théoden tells the guards to et him go.\n\nThe King introduces his new guests to Éowyn, and laments that she is more faithful to him than [[Éomer|her brother]]. Gandalf tells him that Éomer has not been disloyal to the King's orders, but to Wormtongue's. Gandalf advises the King to ride for [[Helm's Deep]], as Saruman will be informed of their arrival soon; he himself will go to find Éomer.\n\nAfter calling for his armour, Théoden and Gandalf ride out at the lead of the Riders. Gandalf splits from the main course, and vows to reunite with them at Helm's Deep. Théoden and Aragorn remain behind, and Aragorn does not answer to the King's question whether there still is hope.\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n! Role !!
