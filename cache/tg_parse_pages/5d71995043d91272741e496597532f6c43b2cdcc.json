The Hoarwell flowed west past the [[Ettenmoors]] and then curved southward, skirting the western edge of the [[Trollshaws]]. Flowing under the [[Last Bridge]] on the [[East-West Road]], it coursed southward until it was joined by the [[Bruinen]] or \"Loudwater\". The Hoarwell turned south-west until at [[Tharbad]] it met with the [[Glanduin]], forming the fenland called the [[Swanfleet]] or ''Nîn-in-Eilph''.<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref> Beyond this point the combined waters were called the Greyflood or [[Gwathló]].<ref name=\"AppendixD\">{{UT|6d}}, discussion of the name ''Glanduin'', \"the Gwathló formed by its [the Glanduin's] confluence with the Mitheithel\", \"At the point of confluence of Glanduin and Mitheithel\", p. 264</ref>\n\n==History==\nAfter the founding of the realm of [[Arnor]] in {{SA|3320|n}},<ref>{{App|SA}}, entry for the year 3320, p. 1084</ref> the Hoarwell was within its boundaries.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, p. 1039</ref> In {{TA|861}},<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 861, p. 1085</ref> when Arnor was divided into the splinter-kingdoms of [[Arthedain]], [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]], the river was within the confines of Rhudaur.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', p. 1040</ref>\n\nAround {{TA|1150|n}},<ref name=\"TA1150\">{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1150, p. 1085</ref> the [[Fallohides]], one of the three kinds of [[Hobbits]], crossed over the Misty Mountains north of Rivendell, travelled down the river Hoarwell and eventually settled in Eriador.<ref name=\"Hobbits\">{{FR|Hobbits}}, p. 3</ref> In the same year, the [[Stoors]], another kind of Hobbits, left their homes at the bank of the river [[Anduin]] and migrated to the west,<ref name=\"Hobbits\"/> crossed the Misty Mountains over the [[Redhorn Gate|Redhorn Pass]]<ref name=\"TA1150\"/> and followed the course of the Loudwater southwards<ref name=\"Hobbits\"/> and settled in the [[Angle]] between the rivers Hoarwell and Loudwater or in [[Dunland]].<ref name=\"TA1150\"/>\n\nWhen [[Angmar]] became powerful about {{TA|1300|n}}, some of the hobbits moved westwards over the Hoarwell and many settled at [[Bree]].<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1300, p. 1086</ref>\n\nAround {{TA|1409|n}},<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1356, p. 1086</ref> the Stoors that had settled in the Angle fled westwards over the Hoarwell and southwards, because of the war with Angmar.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, entry for king Argeleb I, pp. 1040-41</ref>\n\nIn May {{TA|2941|n}},<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2941, p. 1089</ref> [[Thorin and Company]] crossed the Hoarwell on the Last Bridge (and later that night encountered the trolls).<ref name=Mutton/>\n\nOn [[11 October]] {{TA|3018|n}},<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3018, October 11, p. 1092</ref> [[Glorfindel]] drove the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] from the Last Bridge and left a beryl on the roadway to show that the path was safe.<ref>{{FR|Flight}}, p. 210</ref> Two days later,<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3018, October 13, p. 1092</ref> after finding the elf-stone, [[Aragorn]] led the hobbits across the bridge.<ref>{{FR|Flight}}, p. 201</ref>\n\n==Note==\nThe name of the river between the confluence of the Loudwater with the Hoarwell and the confluence of the Glanduin with the combined river is not named on [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[The First Map of The Lord of the Rings]], [[The Third Map of The Lord of the Rings]] or the Map of the North of Middle-earth that he drew during the writing of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. However, it is named \"River Hoarwell\" and \"Mitheithel\" on the [[General Map of Middle-earth]] and [[The West of Middle-earth at the End of the Third Age]] map, respectively, which [[Christopher Tolkien]] drew for earlier published editions of ''The Lord of the Rings'' and for ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''.\n\nThe wording in the narrative of ''The Lord of the Rings'' and in its Appendix A is ambiguous if that part of the river was called the Greyflood or continued to be called the Hoarwell or Mitheithel. [[Aragorn|Strider]] tells the Hobbits that the Hoarwell joins the Loudwater \"away in the South\" and that \"Some call it the Greyflood after that\". However he does not specify if that means that \"some\" call it the Greyflood already immediately after the confluence of the two rivers or after some other point further downstream from the confluence. Appendix A mentions that the Glanduin flows into the Greyflood and that the Greyflood and the Glanduin were the southern border of Eriador. It also mentions that [[Arnor]] at is greatest extent included all of Eriador, except \"the lands east of Greyflood and the Loudwater, in which lay Rivendell and [[Eregion|Hollin]]\". However, if the river continued to be called the Hoarwell after its confluence with the Loudwater and if it only started to be called the Greyflood after the confluence of the combined river with the Glanduin, then Hollin was not east of the Greyflood, because the Glanduin formed the southern border of Hollin,<ref name=\"AppendixD\"/> except at the point of the confluence of the Glanduin and the Hoarwell at the very beginning of the Greyflood.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English name ''Hoarwell'' has the sense of \"hoary spring\". It is a combination of ''hoar'' (\"greyish-white\") and [[Old English]] ''well'' (\"well\", \"spring\", \"stream\").<ref name=\"UI\">{{HM|UI}}, entry ''Hoarwell'', p. 15</ref>\n\nThe [[Sindarin]] name ''Mitheithel'' has the same meaning: \"hoary spring\".<ref name=\"UI\"/> It is composed of ''[[mith]]'' (\"pale grey\") and ''[[eithel]]'' (\"spring\", \"source\").<ref>{{HM|N}}, entry '''Hoarwell''', p. 772</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn the 1937 version of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' the Hoarwell was described as a rushing ''red'' river coming from the mountains ''in front'' of the company. In the 1966 edition the adjective \"red\" was removed and the river came from the north in order to match the geography of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Hoarwell.jpg|thumb|250px|Hoarwell in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Most of the Hoarwell is open to exploration, from its sources in the [[Ettenmoors]] to its confluence with the [[Gwathló]]. Only part of it between the Ettenmoors and the Trollshaws is inaccessible.\n{{references}}\n\n[[de:Mitheithel]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/eaux/montagnes de brume/mitheithel]]\n[[fi:Mitheithel]]\n\n[[Category:Eriador]]\n[[Category:Rivers]]"}}}
