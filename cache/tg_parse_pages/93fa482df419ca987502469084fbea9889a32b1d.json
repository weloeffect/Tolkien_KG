It lay all around the fortress of [[Angband]] and on both sides of the [[Ered Engrin]]. Its borders were the [[Ered Wethrin]] to the west, the [[Ered Luin]] to the east, and the [[Dorthonion]],  the [[Pass of Sirion]] and the [[March of Maedhros]] to the south. \n\nThe Ered Engrin, an absolutely unclimbable chain, split the region in two separate parts. The southern part was [[Ard-galen]], the great grassy plain north of [[Beleriand]], later to become the desert of [[Anfauglith]] after the [[Dagor Bragollach]] had utterly burned it. The northern part was an unnamed region, cold and vast.\n\n==History==\nIt was here, north of the mountains, that the [[Orcs]] and other creatures of Morgoth lived and bred.<ref name=S13>{{S|13}}</ref>\n\nThe march of the [[Noldor]] in the late [[First Age]] was halted there, when [[Fëanor]] was mortally wounded by the [[Balrogs]]. The Noldor then encircled the land (at least in the south), starting the [[Siege of Angband]].<ref name=S13/>\n\n==Etymology==\nIn the published ''[[The Silmarillion|Silmarillion]]'', the name ''Dor Daedeloth'' is translated as \"Land of the Shadow of Horror\".<ref>{{S|Index}}, entry \"Dor Daedeloth\"</ref> In other sources it is spelled as '''''Dor-Daedeloth''''', and translated as \"Land of Great Dread\".<ref>{{WJ|Index}}, p. 435</ref>\n\n[[Robert Foster]] notes that the name appears only in the chapter ''[[Of the Return of the Noldor]]'' and is not mentioned again after the [[Siege of Angband]].<ref>{{HM|Guide}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n'''''Dor-Daideloth''''' was the name used for the region in early versions of the [[legendarium]].<ref>{{SM|Index}}, entry \"Dor-Daideloth\"</ref>\n\nIn [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s final writings, the name was changed on the primary map to '''''Dor-na-Daerachas'''''.<ref>{{HM|WJ}}, pp. 187, 338</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Beleriand]]\n[[Category:Evil realms]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n\n[[de:Dor Daedeloth]]\n[[fi:Dor Daedeloth]]"}}}
