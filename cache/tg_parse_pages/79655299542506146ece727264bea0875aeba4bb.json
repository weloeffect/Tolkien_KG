Notably, this is one of the few adaptations of the novel in a different medium - be it radio or film - that omits very little of the original storyline, preserving even many of the minor and frequently omitted characters.\n\nThe events set after the [[War of the Ring]] are somewhat abbreviated, particularly the Grey Havens and Frodo's, Bilbo's and Gandalf's departure from Middle-earth).\n\nMinor characters adapted from the novel include Gildor, Tom Bombadil, Goldberry, Daddy Twofoot, Farmer Maggot, Háma and Imrahil.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!
