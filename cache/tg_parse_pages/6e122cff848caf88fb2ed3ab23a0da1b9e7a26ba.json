Since the great North-South Road was the chief route of communication between the two kingdoms together they built and maintained the Bridge of Tharbad.  Long causeways carried the road to the bridge and a considerable garrison of soldiers, mariners and engineers were kept nearby. \nThe Bridge was guarded by a fort spanning both sides of the river.<ref>{{UT|6}}, p. 264</ref>\n\nHowever, after the [[Great Plague]] came in {{TA|1636}} the region fell quickly into decay.  By the [[War of the Ring]], when [[Boromir]] made his great journey from [[Minas Tirith]] to [[Rivendell]] the causeways were crumbling remains, Tharbad was reduced to dwindling mounds, and the ruins of the bridge had formed a dangerous ford.<ref>{{UT|6}}</ref> Boromir lost his horse at the ruined bridge.<ref>{{FR|II8}}</ref>\n\n== Portrayal in adaptations ==\n'''2022: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Named \"the Great Bridge\", the bridge of Tharbad is utterly broken and in ruin.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Bridges]]\n[[fi:Tharbadin silta]]"}}}
