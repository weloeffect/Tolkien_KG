Collingwood and J.N.L. Myres. In his Preface (dated [[14 January]] [[1936]]), Collingwood thanks his \"colleague Professor  [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]\" for having helped him \"untiringly with problems of [[Celtic]] philology\" (p. vii). Tolkien is again explicitly mentioned in a footnote:<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Christina Scull]], [[Wayne G.

Sulis,<sup>1</sup> the goddess of the hot springs at Bath, came into her own at a very early date; her temple, with its classical architecture and very unclassical sculpture, was probably built in the Flavian period. But less than thirty miles away across the Severn, Nodens, the hunter-god of the Forest of Dean, who survived in later mythology as Nuada of the Silver Hand, king of the Tuatha dé Danann, and later still as King Lear, ''[…]''<br><sup>1</sup>. She is traditionally called Sul; but Professor Tolkien points out to me that the Celtic nominative can only be Sulis, and our authority for believing that even the Romans made a nominative Sul on the analogy of their own word ''sol'' — perhaps meaning the same — is not good. The Celtic ''sulis'' may mean ‘the eye’, and this again may mean the sun.|Chapter XVI, \"Religion\", p. 264}}\n\n==External links==\n*\"[http://lingwe.blogspot.se/2010/08/new-tolkien-reference-well-almost-new.html A new Tolkien reference — well, almost new]\" by [[Jason Fisher]]\n\n{{references}}\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Publications with contribution by J.R.R.
