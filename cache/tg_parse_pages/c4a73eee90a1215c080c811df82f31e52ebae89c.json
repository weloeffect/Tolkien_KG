Tolkien]], [[Letter 44]]}}\nThe '''Suffield Family''' is an English family to which [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s mother, [[Mabel Tolkien]], belonged.\n\n==History==\nThe Suffield Family had its origin in the small town of [[Evesham]], Worcestershire. By the time Tolkien was born, most of the family lived in [[Birmingham]]. At some point in time, the Suffields were engravers and plate-makers.<ref name=BII>{{B|II}}</ref>\n==J.R.R. Tolkien==\nAfter [[Arthur Tolkien]] died in [[1896]], Mabel Tolkien moved her family to Birmingham where they stayed with family before finding a place of their own and while Mabel was sick with diabetes. The Suffields were devout Anglicans, and when Mabel converted to Catholicism she faced strong resistance from her family. After the death of Mabel Tolkien, her sons lived for a time with their aunt [[Beatrice Suffield]].<ref name=BII>{{B|II}}</ref>\n\nTolkien grew very fond of the Suffields, remarking that while his last name was Tolkien, \"I am in fact far more of a Suffield\".<ref>{{L|165}}</ref> He was very interested in learning about his family history, and his grandfather, [[John Suffield]] was only too happy to oblige. Often his stories were exaggerated or fictional, such as his claims that King William IV had once given the family a coat of arms or that they were related to Lord Suffield.<ref name=BII>{{B|II}}</ref>\n==Family tree==\n\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | JS |y| ES | | | | | | | | | | | |JS=[[John Suffield]]|ES=Emily Sparrow}}\n{{familytree| | | | |,|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|v|-|-|^|v|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|.|}}\n{{familytree| | | |MI|y|WI| | JS | | WS|~|BB| |MS |y| AT | | | | | | | |MI=May Suffield|WI=Walter Incledon|JS=[[Jane Neave|Jane Suffield]]|WS=William Suffield|BB=Beatrice Bartlett|MS=[[Mabel Tolkien]]|AT=[[Arthur Tolkien]]}}\n{{familytree| | | | |,|-|^|-|.| | | | | | | | | | | | | | ||,|-|^|-|.| | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | |MI| |FMI | | | | | | | | | | | | | |JRR | | HT |MI=Marjorie Incledon|FMI=[[Mary Incledon]]|JRR=[[J.R.R.
