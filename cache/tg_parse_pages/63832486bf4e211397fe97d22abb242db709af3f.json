All that he commanded - hunters, herdsmen, and villagers - were scantily equipped save for his own household.<ref>{{RK|V1}}</ref> However, since he was not mentioned among the fallen in the [[Song of the Mounds of Mundburg]] it appears that he did survive the great battle.<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Golasgil.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Golasgil in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Golasgil is first met on the second level of [[Minas Tirith]], overlooking the training of his soldiers before the battle. He participates in the defence of the city during the siege and later fights in the [[Battle of Pelennor Fields]]. During the battle he is separated from his allies, but is able to fend off a party of orcs by himself and survives. He joins the [[Army of the West]] and follows [[Aragorn]]'s command to the [[Black Gate]] of [[Mordor]]. During the [[Battle of the Morannon]] Golasgil is killed by a large [[Olog-hai]]. He is survived by his wife, Lady Marra, and his young son Orgolas.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:Gondorians]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n\n[[de:Golasgil]]\n[[fi:Golasgil]]"}}}
