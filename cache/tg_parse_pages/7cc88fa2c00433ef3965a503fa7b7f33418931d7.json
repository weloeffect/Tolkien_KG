He was considered to be the best archer and huntsman of his time. He became a friend and brother-in-arms of [[Túrin]], before falling victim to the [[úmarth]] surrounding Túrin.\n\n==History==\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Beleg.jpg|thumb|right|Beleg in Taur-nu-Fuin (later interpreted as a Hobbit), from \"[[:File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Fangorn Forest.jpg|Beleg finds Flinding in Taur-na-Fúin]]\" by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]\n\nTogether with [[Mablung]], Beleg was one of the great captains of the [[Sindar]]. Beleg was captain of the [[Marchwardens]] and therefore was usually on duty on Doriath's northern borders near [[Brethil]], [[Dimbar]] and [[Nan Dungortheb]]. Beleg carried a black bow named [[Belthronding]], to which his [[epessë]] (surname) referred, and an arrow called [[Dailir]].\n\nIn {{FA|458}},<ref>{{GA|160}}. pp. 56-7</ref> following the capture of [[Minas Tirith (Beleriand)|Minas Tirith]] upon [[Tol Sirion]] by [[Sauron|Gorthaur]], a legion of Orcs invaded [[East Beleriand]], coming down through the [[Pass of Sirion]], and fought the [[Haladin]] near [[Brethil]]. To this battle Beleg brought a great strength of Elves armed with axes and bows, and issuing from the forest, they took the Orcs by surprise and utterly destroyed their host. This, for a while, stemmed the tide coming from the North, as enemies did not dare cross the [[Taeglin]] for many years after.<ref name=\"Bragollach\" />\n\nHe took part in the [[Hunting of the Wolf]], together with King Thingol, Mablung, [[Beren|Beren Ercharmion]] and the great hound [[Huan]].\n\nAlong with Mablung, he was among the only Iathrim who joined the hosts of the Noldor in [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]].<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>\n\n===With Túrin===\nLater, he became a good friend and brother-in-arms of [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]], and thus became ensnared in Túrin's accursed fate. For a long time Túrin joined Beleg in Dimbar.\n\nWhen Túrin fled from [[Doriath]], Beleg received permission from Thingol to follow him into exile and give his pardon to return. He deemed his bow unsuited for this task and from Thingol's armoury chose the sword [[Anglachel]] that [[Eöl]] had forged and given to Thingol in tribute. He took it despite Melian's warnings that the sword possessed the malice of its creator. \n\nBeleg was captured by the [[Gaurwaith|band of outlaws]] Túrin led near [[Amon Rûdh]] and was tortured, because Túrin was not present. He brought word from Thingol to Túrin that he was free to return to Doriath, but Túrin neglected the offer. After returning to Thingol to bring the news, Beleg returned into the north marches; when winter came, he set out again to join Túrin.<ref>{{CH|6}}</ref>\n\nThe outlaws had meanwhile taken about at [[Bar-en-Danwedh]], the halls of [[Mîm]], the [[Petty-dwarf]]. \n\nTogether with Túrin, Beleg became for a while [[Two Captains|a captain]] of the Outlaws against [[Morgoth]]. The place where they dwelt became known as [[Dor-Cúarthol]], the \"Land of Bow and Helm\". Beleg healed [[Andróg]] from an arrow wound, causing the hatred of Mîm who not only hated the Elves, but also because Andróg was his enemy. When Mîm was captured by Orcs, he didn't hesitate to reveal where the outlaws had their refuge. \n\nAfter fierce battle upon the top of Amon Rûdh all men were slain and Túrin captured. Beleg was bound and left back alive, as was demanded by Mîm who wanted to deal with the Elf personally. But Andróg was still alive, though mortally wounded, and he chased Mîm away and cut through Beleg's bonds before dying.<ref>{{CH|8}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nBeleg followed the [[Orcs]] into [[Taur-nu-Fuin (Dorthonion)|Taur-nu-Fuin]], where he met [[Gwindor]], an Elf of [[Nargothrond]] who had been captured in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad but escaped from slavery in Morgoth's mines. With help from Gwindor, who had seen the passing by Orc-band, Beleg found the Orc-camp at night. He shot one by one the [[wolves]] who guarded the camp. He then was able to rescue Túrin, who was unconscious because of the torture he had endured, during a thunderstorm.\n\nBeleg carried Túrin away from the camp and cut his bonds with his sword. But the blade slipped away and cut into Túrin's flesh. Awaking suddenly and filled with terrible memories of past torture, Túrin only perceived a shape bent over him with a blade and believed the Orcs were about to torture him again. Finding his hands unbound, in a sudden rage of self-defence, Túrin wrested Anglachel from Beleg and killed him.\n\nBeleg was buried along with his bow Belthronding by Túrin and Gwindor. Anglachel had turned black and blunt when it spilled its master's blood. But Gwindor took it with him, for he deemed it better to use the blade for vengeance against Morgoth, than to leave it rotting in the earth.<ref name=\"Death\">{{CH|9}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nOnce recovered of the shock of killing Beleg, Túrin made a song for him, named ''[[Laer Cú Beleg]]'', the Song of the Great Bow.<ref name=\"Death\" /> Years later, Túrin faced his destiny in [[Cabed-en-Aras]], commiting suicide after addressing Gurthang, which answered him mentioning his past crime:\n\n{{Blockquote|Yea, I will drink thy blood gladly, that so I may forget the blood of Beleg my master, and the blood of Brandir slain unjustly. I will slay thee swiftly.<ref>{{CH|18}}</ref>}}\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Beleg Cuthalion.mp3|Ardamir}}\n''[[Beleg (word)|beleg]]'' is a [[Sindarin]] word meaning \"great, mighty; large, big\".<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entry ''beleg''</ref>\n\nHis [[epessë]] ''Cúthalion'' is Sindarin for \"Strongbow\", from ''[[cú]]'' (\"bow\") + ''[[thalion]]'' (\"strong, dauntless\").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entries ''cú'', ''thalion''</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n{{Gaurwaith}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Children of Húrin]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Gnomish names]]\n[[Category:Ilkorin names]]\n[[Category:Moriquendi]]\n[[Category:Sindar]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n\n[[de:Beleg Cúthalion]]\n[[fr:encyclo:personnages:elfes:teleri:sindar:beleg]]\n[[fi:Beleg (haltia)]]"}}}
