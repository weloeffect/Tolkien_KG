The main river of the Shire, [[the Water]], flowed into its western end and exited its eastern end. A stream from the [[Northfarthing]] (which may have been the [[Norbourn]]) entered Bywater Pool on its northern side.<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nBefore the [[War of the Ring]], Bywater Pool had had a pleasant row of old [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] holes in the north bank, with little gardens that had run down to the water’s edge. Along the Pool-side where the [[Hobbiton]] Road ran close to the south bank there had grown an avenue of trees. On [[2 November]], {{TA|3019|n}}, when the [[Travellers]] arrived at Bywater, they found the holes in the north bank deserted, their gardens filled with weeds, and the avenue of trees gone – replaced by a line of ugly new houses.<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Bywater Pool.jpg|thumb|left|The Bywater Pool in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Bywater Pool is a major landmark, its location being in the center of the in-game region of [[the Shire]]. It is a prime fishing spot, and fishing contests are taking place there during the annual Farmers Faire festival. \n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Lakes]]\n[[Category:The Shire]]\n\n[[de:Wasserauer See]]\n[[fi:Virranlampi]]"}}}
