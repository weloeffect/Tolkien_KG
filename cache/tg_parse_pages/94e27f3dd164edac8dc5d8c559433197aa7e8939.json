It is published as the first song in ''[[Songs for the Philologists]]'' in [[1936]].\n\nBeing the opening verse of the ''Songs'', it suits well the style of the \"[[Viking Club]]\", where [[Tolkien]] and [[E.V. Gordon]] would \"read Old Norse sagas and drink a lot of beer\" with students.\n\n==The song==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\n'''Grace'''\n\nIf I drink water while this does last,\n    May I never again drink wine:\nFor how can a man, in his life of a span,\n    Do anything better than dine?\n\nWe'll dine and drink, and say if we think\n    That anything better can be;\nAnd when we have dined, wish all mankind\n    May dine as well as we.\n</poem>\n\n[[Category:Poems and songs in Songs for the Philologists]]"}}}
