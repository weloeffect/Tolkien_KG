Although Tolkien actively defended against being allegorical, he admitted having been just that in ''Leaf by Niggle'' in [[Letter 199|a letter]] to Caroline Everett ([[24 June]] [[1957]]):<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=https://tolkienlibrary.com/reviews/leafbyniggle.htm|articlename=Leaf by Niggle - a symbolic story about a small painter|accessed=12 June 2022|website=TL}}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|''\"I should say that, in addition to my tree-love (it was originally called The Tree), it arose from my own pre-occupation with the Lord of the Rings, the knowledge that it would be finished in great detail or not at all, and the fear (near certainty) that it would be 'not at all'. The war had arisen to darken all horizons. But no such analyses are a complete explanation even of a short story...\"''}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Niggle]] is an artist who paints to please himself, living in a society that holds art in little regard. His main occupation is a huge painting of great tree. He started with one single leaf and the painting grows around it. Niggle hopes to draw every leaf in detail. Soon Niggle finds birds in the trees, hills that are visible through the branches. And so the painting grows and takes up all time from the painter. Niggle takes time off from his work, because of politeness, to aid his neighbor, a gardener named Parish who is lame and has a sick wife. In the process of helping Niggle catches a sickness.\n\nThen he is forced to take a trip, but was ill prepared for it (partly due to his illness) and ends up in Workhouse Infirmary where he must labour each day. He is paroled and sent to work as a gardener in the country. He realizes that he is in fact working in the forest of his painting, but the Tree is the true realization of his vision, not the flawed version in his art.\n\nNiggle is reunited with Parish, his neighbour, and together they make the forest even more beautiful. Finally Niggle travels to the far reaches of the forest, to places on the fringe of his canvas.\n\n==Characters and places==\n{| class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"margin:0 auto;\" width=\"100%\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n! align=\"left\" |<big>Characters</big>\n|-\n|\n<div style=\"-moz-column-width: 400px; -webkit-column-width: 400px; column-width: 400px; -moz-column-gap: 15px; -webkit-column-gap: 15px; column-gap: 15px; -webkit-column-rule: 1px solid #cccccc; -moz-column-rule: 1px solid #cccccc; column-rule: 1px solid #cccccc;\">Listed in order of named appearance:\n#'''[[Niggle]]''' - An obsessive artist who needed to make a journey; Lived within a pleasant house miles away from town; Distracted constantly by interruptions; A distant friend fell ill; his neighbor pressed him for chores; He was constantly kept from niggling on every detail of his life's work.
