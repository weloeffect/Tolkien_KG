In an alliance with [[Arnor]] and Elven forces from [[Lindon]] and [[Rhovanion]], Gondor fought a series of battles against the forces of [[Sauron]].\n\n=== Third Age ===\n\nDuring the [[Third Age]], Gondor's military prowess eventually declined. The major difference was the Gondorian soldiers themselves: although the soldiers would have proudly fought to the last man, they were never as strong as the warriors of the past especially by the second half of the Third Age. After the Great Plague and the [[Kin-strife]], which left Gondor very weakened, many Númenóreans of pure blood had perished during those troublesome times. The Gondorian military wore chain-mail armour with helmets graven with a small silver star.\n\nThe Prince and '''[[Captain of Gondor]]''' [[Earnur]] organized the [[Host of the West (Arnor)|Host of the West]], joining forces with [[Arnor]] and Elves.\n\nThe '''[[Guards of the Citadel]]''' wore black mail with [[mithril]] helms and a black and silver surcoat.\n\n== Cavalry ==\n\nTraditionally, Gondor had a small cavalry force. In the last quarter of the Third Age, its close ally [[Rohan]] often supplied the bulk of its cavalry forces. This was true during the [[Wainrider/Balchoth War]] as well as during the [[War of the Ring]]. Before the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields|Battle of Pelennor Fields]], a mixed force of infantry and cavalry retreated from the [[Causeway Forts]] and [[Osgiliath]] to the citadel of [[Minas Tirith]]. Pursued by Orcs on the ground and Nazgûl from the sky, these forces were in great peril. Lord [[Denethor]], Steward of Gondor, finally released a mounted counter-attack against them, which drove them back. Leading this attack was the Prince [[Imrahil]] of [[Dol Amroth]] and his mounted swan-knights. These men represented the elite cavalry force of Gondor.<ref>{{RK|Siege}}</ref>\n\n== King's Ships ==\n\nThe '''King's Ships'''<ref>{{PM|XVI}}, p. 416, note 14</ref> constituted the sea-going defence forces of the Southern kingdom of [[Gondor]]. They were often in action against the forces of [[Umbar]], as reavers would attack the coast of the South Kingdom.\n\nBefore the Downfall of [[Númenor]], it had been known as a mighty sea power, the greatest that ever existed in Middle-earth. Previously they had sent great fleets, under [[Minastir]], to the aid of [[Gil-galad]] against Sauron in the middle of the Second Age. [[Elendil]] and his sons, who founded [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]], were all great mariners; therefore, there was a long distinguished tradition of shipbuilding, sea exploration, and sea-power projection. By {{TA|830}}, the '''[[Captain of the Hosts]]''' [[Tarannon]] was engaged in heavy fleet building, and became known as the first of the [[Ship-kings]] of Gondor.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref> These fleets were usually based at Pelargir, and sometimes Umbar.\n\nDuring the [[Kin-strife]], the '''[[Captain of Ships]]''' was [[Castamir]] who used his position to find supporters against the King. After the Kin-strife, the defeated rebels took refuge in [[Umbar]], where they long troubled Gondor. Late in the Third Age, [[Thorongil]] (Aragorn II) led a Gondorian naval task force in a raid known as the [[Surprise Attack on Umbar]]. This was a successful raid that neutralized the [[Corsairs of Umbar|Corsairs']] naval power for decades, and reduced the southern pressure on Gondor at a time when its power was waning.\n\n==Special forces==\nSoldiers fully trained and experienced had the title of ''ohtar'' 'warrior, soldier'. Some were admitted to the rank of ''roquen'', \"knight\".<ref>{{UT|Gladden}}, note 17.</ref>\n\nSeveral groups were armed men operating often behind enemy lines. Late in the Third Age, as the power of [[Mordor]] grew, Gondor withdrew most of its conventional forces from east of the Anduin, including North and South [[Ithilien]]. They did not abandon the area completely, however, and maintained a guerilla presence there, the '''[[Rangers of Ithilien]]'''. During the [[War of the Ring]], this force was commanded by [[Faramir]], son of [[Denethor II]]. They acted as a reconnaissance force, and often harassed Sauron's forces.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Gondorians]]\n[[Category:Armies]]"}}}
