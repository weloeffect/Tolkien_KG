He was the chief of a people on the edge of the [[Belegaer|Western Sea]] and a [[Seer|twilight-walker]] who often wandered along the beaches and coastlines. One evening upon a rocky shore, He witnessed great clouds that looked similarly to the \"''eagles of the Lord of the West''\". These clouds filled him with [[foresight|foreboding]]. Immediately afterwards, Agaldor left the shore to walk along the beach and behind the land-wall to some houses that have lights inside. The [[Men]] sitting outside waited until he was out of earshot to speak of him. Agaldor [[foresight|foresaw]] among other things, the arrival of the [[Númenóreans]] and the redemption of mankind ahead. Agaldor was later killed by the Númenóreans when they arrived as rebels of the Gods. They took the chieftainship of Agaldor's lands.<ref>{{LR|P1III3}}, pp. 85-7</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Agaldor'' appears to be a [[Noldorin]] name, though it’s meaning is unclear. ''Galdor'' is only glossed in ''[[The Etymologies]]'' as a [[Noldorin]] name from ''Gala'' (\"thrive\").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry \"GALA-\"</ref> The name ''Amroth'' appears to also be a [[Noldorin]] name possibly comprised of the element ''[[am]]'' (\"up\").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3705219453.html|articlename=N. ''Amroth'' m.|website=Eldamo}}</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the Legendarium ==\nIn an alternative version, Agaldor was referred to as '''Amroth''' as he wrestled with [[Thû]].\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Men]]\n[[Category:The Lost Road]]\n[[de:Agaldor]]"}}}
