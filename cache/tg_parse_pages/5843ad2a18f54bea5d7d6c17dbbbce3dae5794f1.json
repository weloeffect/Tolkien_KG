It would reuse most of the cast for their [[The Lord of the Rings (1979 radio series)|radio series]] of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' of the same year. The music featured in the radio drama were pulled from production music produced by Major Records. Primarily Featuring composer Roger Roger but also contains works from George Chase and Sam Trust. They would use the same music library for their adaptation of Lord of The Rings, some pieces being shared between the two.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!Actor!!Role\n|-\n|[[Erik Bauersfeld]]||[[Smaug]], [[Bard]]\n|-\n|[[Gail Chugg]]||Narrator, [[Gollum]], [[Balin]]\n|-\n|Pat Franklyn||[[Roac]], [[Thranduil|The Elven King]], [[Bombur]]\n|-\n|Carl Hague||[[Elrond]]\n|-\n|Joe Hughes||[[Great Goblin]], [[Beorn]]\n|-\n|Tom Luce||[[Thorin]]\n|-\n|[[Bernard Mayes]]||[[Gandalf]]\n|-\n|[[Ray Reinhardt]]||[[Bilbo Baggins]]\n|}\n\n==Music==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!Composer!!Piece!!Matrix Runout\n!Record name and/or number\n|-\n|Roger Roger||Morning Breezes||TVJ-9141 (E4-QB-3409-1)\n|Mood Music -  5217\n|- \n|Sam Trust||Plague Spot||TJV-95-A\n|Production Music - 95\n|-\n|Roger Roger||Swirling Fog||5215-A\n|Production Music - 51\n|- \n|Roger Roger||Dreaming Awake||\n|58\n|-\n|George Chase\n|Mockery\n|\n|Mood Music - 98\n|-\n|George Chase||Black Passage||\n|99\n|-\n|Roger Roger||Null||\n|\n|-\n|George Chase||Tenderness - Soliloquy||\n|\n|-\n|Sam Trust||Swamp Interim||TJV-95-A\n|Production Music - 95\n|-\n|Roger Roger||Martians Patrol||\n|59\n|-\n|Roger Roger||A Mysterious Night||\n|Production Music - 51\n|-\n|George Chase||A Tale of Woe (Theme)||\n|99\n|-\n|Roger Roger||Spell of the Unknown||\n|59\n|-\n|Roger Roger||Dramatic Appasionata||TVJ-9141 (E4-QB-3409-1)\n|Mood Music -  5217 or Production Music - 51\n|-\n|Sam Trust||Thought||TJV-95-A\n|Production Music - 95\n|-\n|Sam Trust||Swamp||TJV-95-A\n|Production Music - 95\n|-\n|Enrico Simonetti||Finale||\n|99\n|-\n|Roger Roger||Sliding Bridge||\n|58\n|-\n|Roger Roger||Unknown Danger||\n|58\n|-\n|George Chase||Tenderness - Pastoral||\n|\n|-\n|George Chase\n|Bleak House - Soliloquy\n|\n|98\n|-\n|Earl Salisbury\n|Valley Green - Soliloquy\n|\n|94\n|-\n|Earl Salisbury\n|Valley Green - Bridge (I)\n|\n|94\n|}\nThere are six other songs that have not been identified yet. Null* is piece that has been identified but as far as we can tell only exists online under a different name and edited and manipulated. There are three songs not listed here that seem were made specifically for this adaptation and only exist within the drama itself. The song is [[Far over the misty mountains cold]]. It is based on the poem that Tolkien wrote for the book but in the adaptation it has been edited where some verses are removed entirely or show up later in the play. I said three songs were made for this adaptation, that was one, the other two are little off shoots of [[Far over the misty mountains cold]]. Anything you hear with an Auto-harp was written for the play.\n\n==Food & Comfort==\nTobacco, Tea, Beer, Seed Cake, Red Wine, Raspberry Jam, Apple-Tart, Mince Pie, Cheese, Pork-Pie, Salad, Cake, Ale, Coffee, Eggs, Chicken, Pickles, Biscuit, fried egg, poached egg, ham, porridge, oranges, Toasted mutton, Gravy, Blackberry, fish, rabbit, bread and honey, nuts, flour, dried fruits.  \n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.amazon.com/The-Hobbit-Six-Dramatized-Cassettes/dp/B000MDIMAU/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1215429838&sr=1-4 Purchase at Amazon]\n*[https://www.amazon.com/Hobbit-Abridged-Audiobook-Publisher-HighBridge/dp/B004T4K5AI/ref=sr_1_1crid=29ILN4TC9NFGZ&keywords=highbridge+the+hobbit&qid=1674942405&s=books&sprefix=highbridge+the+hobbit%2Cstripbooks%2C80&sr=1-1 CD Version on Amazon]\n*[https://www.amazon.com/The-Hobbit-J-R-R-Tolkien-audiobook/dp/B000R3OP2Y/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=highbridge+the+hobbit&qid=1674942475&s=books&sr=1-2 mp3 Version on Audable]\n*[https://www.amazon.com/Lord-Rings-Hobbit-J-Tolkien/dp/1565117077/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=highbridge+the+hobbit&qid=1674942492&s=books&sr=1-4 Lord of The Rings, The Hobbit CD Box Set On Amazon]\n*[https://www.amazon.com/Hobbit-Wood-Box-J-R-R-Tolkien/dp/1611749085/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=highbridge+the+hobbit&qid=1674942492&s=books&sr=1-6 Wooden Box CD Version on Amazon]\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Radio adaptations]]"}}}
