Númenóreans had a self-healing power superior to the [[Men]] in [[Middle-earth]], and sickness was rare among them until the decay of the isle. However, they had learned much of this lore from the [[Eldar]] and they found practical to keep a continued study of medicine in case sickness appeared. Thus, in their first travels to Middle-earth, Númenóreans were most welcomed by native Men, as they shared their knowledge of these skills.<ref>{{NM|P3xi}}, p. 322, cf. footnote</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Hröangolmë'' is clearly [[Quenya]], from ''[[hröa]]'' (\"body\") + ''[[ñolmë]]'' (\"lore, knowledge\").\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Activities]]\n[[Category:Quenya nouns]]"}}}
