[[Mark Fisher]] stated in a note on the [[Encyclopedia of Arda]] that{{blockquote|There is no annal or record of Scatha's death, so identifying the correct date is problematic. The only known date that's remotely related is that of Frumgar's foundation of the Éothéod in III 1977. Frumgar was the father of Fram, who slew Scatha, but these bare facts leave considerable leeway for speculation.<br/>The earliest possible date for Scatha's death, then, would be III 1977, the year of the Éothéod's founding (though we might expect the event to be specially remarked if this were the case). At the other end of the scale, we might assume that Frumgar was a young man when he led his people northwards, that Fram was born late in his father's life, and that he didn't slay Scatha until advanced in years himself. Under those conditions, the date might extend as far as - at a real stretch - III 2100. As a compromise, we've assumed a date here of roughly III 2000, a few decades after the establishment of the Éothéod.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Mark Fisher]]|articleurl=https://www.glyphweb.com/arda/s/scatha.html|articlename=Scatha|dated=31 October 1998|website=EoA|accessed=5 November 2025}}, note 1</ref>}}\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Scatha.jpg|thumb|left|Scatha in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2020: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:[https://lotro-wiki.com/wiki/Scatha Scatha] appears as a [[fire-drake]] in a flashback narrating the history of [[Fram]] and the [[Éothéod]].
