It later became known as [[wikipedia:Great Haywood|Great Haywood]].<ref name=\"Tol\">{{LT1|In}}, p. 25</ref>\n\nThe village was located in the west of the [[Gnomish]]-speaking area of Tol Eressëa,<ref>{{PE|14}}, p. 62</ref> near the confluence of the rivers [[Afros]] and [[Gruir]],<ref name=\"Afr\"/> where [[Tram Nybol]], the grey bridge of Tavrobel, spanned the two rivers.<ref name=\"Nyb\"/>\n\n== History ==\n=== Early history ===\nAfter the [[March of Liberation]] and the defeat of [[Melko]], the exiled [[Gnomes]] settled on the Lonely Isle and made many settlements, one of them being Tavrobel. One of its most famous inhabitants was [[Gilfanon]], the Lord of Tavrobel,<ref name=\"Afr\"/> who lived in the [[House of the Hundred Chimneys]] nearby.<ref>{{LT1|VIII}}, pp. 174-5</ref>\n\nThe [[Tower of Tavrobel]] was located there.<ref>{{LT1|VIII}}, p. 174</ref> The great [[Pine of Tavrobel]] was located there as well, which reached the [[stars]]. There, according to one outline, after Melko's escape from his second imprisonment, [[Telimektar]] son of [[Tulkas]] and [[Ingil]] son of [[Inwë]] chased Melko up the Pine, all the way to [[Ilwë]]. Afterwards, the Pine was cut down, and Melko was stranded outside of the world, perpetually guarded by Ingil and Telimektar, preventing his return until the [[Great End]].<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''4''', pp. 281-2</ref>\n\n=== Arrival of Eriol and the Faring Forth ===\nSometime during the [[wikipedia:5th century|5th century AD]],<ref>{{LT1|In}}, p. 23</ref> a [[Men|Mannish]] mariner called [[Eriol]] arrived to Tol Eressëa, and was eventually hosted by Gilfanon at his home in Tavrobel, where he compiled the ''[[Golden Book]]'' from the tales he had heard from the [[Elves]], and was then allowed to drink ''[[limpë]]''.<ref name=\"Eri\">{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''5''', p. 283</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Faring Forth]], when the island of Tol Eressëa was dragged across the Ocean and anchored off the coast of the [[Great Lands]], there occurred a [[Battle of the Heath of the Sky-roof|great battle]] not far from Tavrobel, on the [[Heath of the Sky-roof]]. Following the battle, Men occupied Tol Eressëa, and the remaining Elves fled over Afros and Gruir, and Eriol<ref group=\"note\">In another text, Eriol died in Tol Eressëa before the Faring Forth happened.</ref><ref name=\"Eri\"/> wrote the last words of the ''Golden Book'' in an empty Tavrobel.<ref name=\"Afr\">{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''8''', pp. 287-9</ref>\n\nLater, Tavrobel was conquered by [[Heorrenda]] son of Eriol, and became known as ''Gréata Hægwudu'', and eventually as ''Great Haywood''.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, pp. 292-3</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''Tavrobel'' is in [[Gnomish]], meaning \"Wood-home\", consisting of the elements ''[[tavros (Gnomish word)|tavros]]'' (\"forest, wooded land\") + ''[[pel]]'' (\"village, hamlet\").<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1557311155.html|articlename=G.

In that reimagining of the [[legendarium]], Tol Eressëa ceased to be identified with [[wikipedia:England|England]]/[[wikipedia:British Isles|British Isles]] - instead, it became a completely different island, and [[wikipedia:Great Britain|Great Britain]] became the island of [[Luthany]].<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, pp. 300-1</ref>\n\nSo, as opposed to the previous conception, where the Elves of the Great Lands sailed directly to Tol Eressëa following the defeat of Melko in the [[March of Liberation]], the Elves now sailed to Luthany instead.\n\nThere, they built many cities and settlements - and, after their ''eventual'' return to Tol Eressëa, named many places there ''after'' the ones in Luthany. For example, the village of Tavrobel (the New) in Tol Eressëa was named after '''Tavrobel the Old''' in Luthany.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''27''', pp. 307-8</ref>\n\nIn some of the contemporary texts, it is said that after [[Ælfwine]] wedded [[Earissë]] the daughter of [[Lindo]], he went to live in Tavrobel, where he had two sons - Heorrenda and [[Hlúdwine]].<ref>{{PE|15}}, Appendix, ''Text XI'', p. 18</ref>\n\nAccording to one text, it is said that Ælfwine wrote the ''Golden Book'' and left it in the House of the Hundred Chimneys, \"where it lieth still to read for such as may\".<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''30''', p. 310</ref>\n\n=== Later legendarium ===\nAccording to the later legendarium, from the [[1937]] ''[[Quenta Silmarillion (Lost Road)|Quenta Silmarillion]]'', '''Tavrobel''' or '''Tathrobel'''<ref group=\"note\">''Tathrobel'' was a later change from ''Tavrobel''.</ref> was the home of [[Pengolod]] the Wise in Tol Eressëa, a [[Lambengolmor|loremaster]] of [[Gondolin]], after his return to the [[West]].<ref name=\"Gon\">{{LR|Quenta}}, p. 203</ref>\n\nIt was later visited by [[Ælfwine]], the [[wikipedia:Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] mariner, where Pengolod showed him the histories of the Elves.<ref name=\"Gon\"/>\n\nThe final mention of Tathrobel in the legendarium is in the preamble to ''[[the Later Quenta Silmarillion]]'' from the 1950s.<ref>{{MR|P3II1}}, pp. 199-200</ref>\n\n==== Later etymology ====\nThe name ''Tavrobel'' as used above is in [[Noldorin]]. In ''[[The Etymologies]]'', a text from the 1930s, it is explained as consisting of ''[[tavor]]'' (\"woodpecker, knocker\") + ''[[gobel]]'' (\"village\").<ref name=\"Ety\">{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry '''PEL(ES)-''', p. 380</ref>\n\nThe name was afterwards changed to ''Tathrobel''.<ref>{{LR|A3}}, p. 412</ref> According to [[John Garth]], ''Tathrobel'' means \"willow-home\" in Noldorin.<ref>[[John Garth]], ''[[The Worlds of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', \"The Land of Lúthien\", p. 54</ref>\n\nIn Ælfwine's translation of the ''[[The Earliest Annals of Valinor|Annals of Valinor]]'' to Old English, Tavrobel is called '''''Taþrobel'''''.<ref>{{SM|VA3}}, p. 290</ref>\n\n==== Tavrobel in Brethil ====\nIn ''The Etymologies'', Tavrobel was also considered to be the name of a settlement of [[Túrin]] and the [[Haladin|Woodmen]] of [[Brethil]].<ref name=\"Ety\"/> See: [[Amon Obel]].\n\nIn the ''[[Grey Annals]]'' from the 1950s, there likewise appears a location in Brethil called Tavrobel. It was later changed to [[Bar Haleth]], probably being a transient name for [[Ephel Brandir]].<ref>{{GA|324|n}}, pp. 156-7</ref>\n\n[[Christopher Tolkien]] notes that real-life Great Haywood and the two Tavrobels are near the confluence of two rivers: The Great Haywood: [[Wikipedia:River Sow|Sow]] and [[Wikipedia:River Trent|Trent]]; Tavrobel of Tol Eressea: Afros and Gruir; Tavrobel of Brethil: [[Taeglin|Taiglin]] and [[Sirion]].<ref name=\"Elk\"/>\n\n== Inspiration ==\nTavrobel was inspired by the village of [[wikipedia:Great Haywood|Great Haywood]] in [[wikipedia:Staffordshire|Staffordshire]], where [[Edith Bratt]] lived for a while after her marriage to J.R.R. Tolkien.<ref name=\"Tol\"/> Tolkien was recovering in Great Haywood after returning from the [[Great War]], where he started writing [[The Book of Lost Tales]].<ref>{{B|III}}</ref>\n\nThe two rivers of Tavrobel, Afros and Gruir, were probably inspired by the rivers [[wikipedia:River Sow|Sow]] and [[wikipedia:River Trent|Trent]], which reach their confluence near Great Haywood.<ref name=\"Elk\"/> Also, Tram Nybol, the bridge of Tavrobel, was most likely based on the [[wikipedia:Essex Bridge, Staffordshire|Essex Bridge]], which spans the river Trent near its confluence with Sow.<ref name=\"Nyb\"/>\n\nThe Heath of the Sky-roof, located about a [[wikipedia:League (unit)|league]] from Tavrobel, might have been inspired by the Hopton Heath, a place where a [[wikipedia:Battle of Hopton Heath|battle]] of the [[wikipedia:First English Civil War|English Civil War]] was fought in [[wikipedia:1643|1643]].<ref name=\"Elk\">{{LR|A3}}, p. 413</ref>\n\nAccording to [[John Garth]], however, the Heath of the Sky-roof could have been inspired by the [[wikipedia:Cannock Chase|Cannock Chase]], a small area of countryside not far from Great Haywood, instead. Likewise, the [[Brook of Glass]], a stream near the Heath of the Sky-roof, mentioned in one outline, was most likely based on the Sher Brook that flows through the Cannock Chase.<ref>[[John Garth]], ''[[Tolkien and the Great War]]'', \"Epilogue. 'A new light'\", p. 273</ref>\n\nGilfanon's home, the House of the Hundred Chimneys, might have been based, according to G.L. Elkin, Acting Director of the Shugborough Estate, on the [[wikipedia:Shugborough Hall|Shugborough Hall]], which features prominent chimneys.<ref name=\"Elk\"/> Alternatively, it might have been inspired by a house called Gipsy Green near [[wikipedia:Penkridge|Penkridge]] in Staffordshire.<ref>{{HM|AI}}, p. 26</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*''[[An Evening in Tavrobel]]'' (poem)\n*[[Fladweth Amrod]]\n\n{{references|notes}}\n[[Category:Cities, towns and villages]]\n[[Category:Gnomish locations]]\n[[Category:Locations in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Luthany]]\n[[Category:Noldorin locations]]\n[[Category:Tol Eressëa]]\n[[de:Tavrobel]]"}}}
