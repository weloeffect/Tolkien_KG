It was later known as '''[[Andúril]]'''.\n\n==History==\nThe sword was forged \"in the deeps of time\", probably during the [[First Age]], by [[Telchar]],<ref>{{TT|King}}, paragraph when Aragorn is about to enter the Golden Hall</ref> who was likely the famed Dwarven-smith of [[Nogrod]] of the same name who made swords for the armories of King [[Thingol]] in [[Menegroth]].<ref>{{UT|Departure}}</ref><ref>{{UT|Index}}, entry Telchar</ref><ref>{{S|Index}}, entry Narsil and entry Telchar</ref>\n\nNothing is said of Narsil during the [[Second Age]] until it eventually came into the hands of [[Elendil]] towards the close of the Second Age. \n\nElendil carried Narsil in the [[Battle of Dagorlad]] where it shone with the light of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]], and then in the [[Siege of Barad-dûr]]; but [[Sauron]] killed him and the sword broke into two pieces under him as he fell, and its light was extinguished. Elendil's son [[Isildur]] took up the sword and used its shard to cut [[the One Ring]] from the hand of Sauron.<ref name=rings/> Isildur took the shards home with him. Shortly before Isildur was killed in the second year of the [[Third Age]] in the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]], the shards were rescued by [[Ohtar]], esquire of Isildur.<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref> He took them to [[Rivendell]],<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> where Isildur's youngest son [[Valandil (King of Arnor)|Valandil]] was fostered, but [[Elrond]] foretold that it wouldn't be reforged until the One Ring was found again and Sauron returned.<ref name=rings>{{S|Rings}}</ref>\n\nThe '''Shards of Narsil''' were one of the heirlooms of the [[Kings of Arnor]], and after the Northern Kingdom was destroyed they remained an heirloom of the [[Rangers of the North]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', entry for Chieftain Aranarth</ref>  Elrond delivered the shards of Narsil to [[Aragorn]] when he was twenty years old.<ref>{{App|Tale}}</ref> It was not reforged until the [[War of the Ring]] at the end of the Third Age in Rivendell as '''[[Andúril]]''', the \"Flame of the West\", for Aragorn, who was by that time the [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain|Chieftain of the Dúnedain]] and heir of Isildur.  \n\nHe carried the sword during his journey south as part of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], and fought with it in many instances. He referred to it as the \"Sword That Was Broken\" or \"The Sword Reforged\".\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Narsil'' is a [[Quenya]] name meaning \"red and white flame\".<ref>{{HM|UI}}, p. 231</ref><ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 29</ref> The name is said to consist of the [[Sundocarme|stems]] NAR (\"fire\"; cf. ''[[Nár (Quenya)|nár]]'' \"fire\") + THIL (\"white light\").

It possesses a straight crossguard with axe-like decorations on the tips. The grip is wrapped in black and the pommel is elongated, with a hollow bottom.\n:Narsil was not broken in the fall of Elendil, but by Sauron stepping on the blade as Isildur tried to pull it up. Furthermore, the blade was shattered into many parts, instead of a clean cut into two parts.\n\n:Unlike in the book, Aragorn does not bear the shards with him, but are kept on a display in [[Rivendell]]. Boromir drops the hilt on the floor and Aragorn is seen reverently replacing it back into the display. The sword is not reforged into Andúril until the third film.\n\n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''\n:[[Arwen]] persuades her father, [[Elrond]] to have [[Elves|Elven]] smiths reforge it from the shards and bring to Aragorn. \n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The reforging of Narsil is experienced by the player in the quest arc called \"The Blade that was Broken\". The player sets out to find the last of the Silithair, shining adamants crafted by Elves of the [[house of Fëanor]] in days of old, in order for the Elf-smiths of Imladris to reforge the sword.<ref>[http://lorebook.lotro.com/wiki/Quest_Arc:The_Blade_That_Was_Broken Quest Arc: The Blade That Was Broken], Lorebook, lotro.com</ref>\n\n'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''\n:In the Extended Edition, [[Bilbo Baggins]] approaches and examines the shards in curiosity while in Rivendell, before he notices the mural of Isildur's battle with Sauron (the latter of whom is wearing the One Ring).
