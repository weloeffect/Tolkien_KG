It has since received continuous updating and addons. The most recent release of ''The Last Days'' is version 3.6 (released July 2020), for both ''Mount & Blade'' and ''Mount & Blade: Warband''.<ref>[https://www.moddb.com/mods/the-last-days/downloads/the-last-days-of-the-third-age-36-for-mb-1011 ''The Last Days of the Third Age of Middle-earth'' mod, version 3.6, for ''Mount & Blade'' 1.011], ModDB.com, official overview of ''The Last Days'' mod, 24 July 2020</ref><ref>[https://www.moddb.com/mods/the-last-days/downloads/the-last-days-of-the-third-age-36-for-warband ''The Last Days of the Third Age of Middle-earth'' mod, version 3.6, for ''Mount & Blade: Warband''], ModDB.com, official overview of ''The Last Days'' mod, 24 July 2020</ref> The mod, specifically elements of it (graphics, music, source code), are licensed on an OSP (open-source project) basis since December 2012.<ref>[http://mbx.streetofeyes.com/index.php/topic,2881.0.html ''The Last Days'' OSP conditions / ''TLD goes Open Source'']. Thread by Jan \"Merlkir\" Pospíšil, developer for ''The Last Days'', MBX.StreetOfEyes.com mod development forum. 24 December 2012.</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\n\nThe mod depicts the War of the Ring from the perspective of an ordinary soldier on either the side of the Free Peoples or those that side with Sauron. Playable races include Men, Elves, Dwarves, Orcs and Uruks, for either of the two sides. The mod is played primarily as an action RPG and medieval combat simulation hybrid, from a first and third person perspective, focusing on horseback combat, infantry combat and siege combat at various locations affected by the war. Over time, the player character creates a party of followers and later a company of soldiers and takes part in the War of the Ring under the leadership of commanders from various factions. \n\nUnlike in the base ''Mount & Blade'' games, it is possible for a fortress or settlement to be permanently destroyed by the enemy side, necessitating greater care from players in order to hold and defend territory, while attempting to conquer the territory of the adversary. Another factor new to the strategy and tactics in the game is the player character's standing with the different factions, including his or her allies. It is not calculated globally, instead, the standing develops based strictly on what favours the player had carried out for a particular allied faction. (E.g. It is possible to be a celebrated friend of the Kingdom of Dale, but viewed ambivalently by fellow allies in Lothlórien.)\n\nAs in the ''Mount & Blade'' base game, the player can recruit certain unique companions to become members of their party. The recruitable companions are available to either the good or evil side, but none of them are available to both.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUpqjBpAOxg (Spoiler) Hint video: Where to find the companions for a Free Peoples player character], video by \"Kerendips\", YouTube, 22 May 2019</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR1tWxkJEl0 (Spoiler) Hint video: Where to find the companions for an evil side player character], video by \"Kerendips\", YouTube, 17 October 2020</ref>\n\nThe player can meet various characters from the time of the War of the Ring, including the leaders and notable noblemen of the factions, as well as cameo appearances of the members of the Fellowship of the Ring, as non-player characters.\n\n== Playable factions ==\nThe factions appearing in the total conversion that the player character can join, cooperate with and fight for. It is not possible to serve both a \"Good\" or \"Evil\" faction at the same time. A member of the Free Peoples will be unable to serve Sauron and a follower or ally of Sauron will be unable to cooperate with the Free Peoples.\n\n==== The Free Peoples ====\n\nThe \"Good\" campaign: ''The Dawn of a New Age''\n* [[Gondor]]\n** [[Dol Amroth]]\n** [[Pinnath Gelin]]\n** [[Lamedon]]\n** [[Blackroot Vale]]\n** [[Pelargir]]\n** [[Lossarnach]]\n* [[Rohan]] ([[Rohirrim]])\n* [[Imladris|Elves of Imladris]] ([[Rivendell]])\n** [[Rangers of the North|Dúnedain Rangers]]\n* [[Lothlórien|Elves of Lothlórien]]\n* [[Silvan Elves|Wood Elves]] ([[Woodland Realm]])\n* [[Dwarves]] ([[Kingdom under the Mountain]] and the [[Iron Hills]])\n* [[Kingdom of Dale]] ([[Bardings]] of [[Dale]] and [[Esgaroth]])\n* [[Beornings]] and [[Woodmen]] \n\nGondor is notable for having several further subfactions, meant to represent the different regions and provinces of the kingdom and their varying military traditions and specialties. These have their own unique troop development trees. (Dol Amroth has unique Swan knights, Pinnath Gelin spearmen and archers, Blackroot Vale bowmen, Lossarnach axemen and Pelargir marines.) The Rangers of the North are a subfaction of the host of Rivendell (also with their own separate troop development tree to that of the Imladris elves) and the Beornings and Woodmen form a shared faction (with both groups having their unique troop development trees).\n\n==== The Forces of Sauron ==== \n\nThe \"Evil\" campaign: ''The Twilight of Man''\n* [[Mordor]]\n* [[Dol Guldur]]\n* Men of [[Rhûn]]\n* [[Easterlings]] ([[Variags]] of [[Khand]])\n* [[Haradrim]]\n* [[Corsairs of Umbar]] ([[Black Númenóreans]])\n* [[Isengard]]\n* [[Orcs]] of [[Moria]]\n* [[Gundabad]] [[orcs]]\n* [[Dunlendings]]\n\nThe Dunlendings are the weakest and smallest of the antagonistic factions.\n\n== Music ==\nThe total conversion has an extensive soundtrack of original music, composed for the mod by Australian freelance composer Vladan Zivanovic. No music from other adaptations of Tolkien's work was used. The entire soundtrack of ''The Last Days'' is roughly 150 minutes long. The composer's main emphasis while creating the soundtrack was creating a compelling musical ambience for each environment visited by the player character.<ref>''[http://mbx.streetofeyes.com/index.php/topic,2653.0.html About the soundtrack]''. Thread by Vladan Zivanovic, composer for ''The Last Days'', MBX.StreetOfEyes.com mod development forum. 22 January 2012.</ref>\n\nThe music utilises the ''Mount & Blade engine'''s capability to play music tracks based on the context of the player's location on the map, on the particular time of the day (daytime, night time), on the player's affiliation to a particular faction (both the two major campaign factions and their individual factions), and even on the type of enemy or enemy faction encountered and fought in the game world. There is an abundance of leitmotifs and themes.\n\n== Gallery ==\n\nImages from this total conversion.\n\n=== Screenshots ===\n\n<gallery>\nFile:The Last Days (of the Third Age of Middle-earth) - Minas Tirith 2 (TLD Scene Pack).jpg|[[Minas Tirith]]\nFile:The Last Days (of the Third Age of Middle-earth) -
