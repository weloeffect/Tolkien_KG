Later he studied at the [[wikipedia:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Fine_Arts_Munich|Academy of Fine Arts]] in Munich.\n\nHis pictures often show folksy or religious scenes. His style was impressionistic and in the same way symbolic, too. His works were published in several newspapers and magazines. He wrote some Christmas stories for children. Madlener's Christmas pictures were published in post card series, too.<ref>{{HM|AH}}, \"Chapter I: ''An unexpected Party''\", p. 38f</ref>\n\nJosef Madlener had one known daughter, named Julie Madlener ([[1910]]–[[1999]]).<ref>Biographical data in a brief description of [https://buchfindr.de/buecher/das-goldene-buch-2/''Das goldene Buch'']  on buchfindr.de (German, accessed 21 July 2023)</ref>\n\n==Origin of Gandalf==\nIn [[1935]] the Bavarian fine art publisher F.A. Ackermann published a series of post cards under the title ''Sagen und Märchen'' (Legends and Fairy tales). The series contained six reproductions of folkloristic paintings: \n* ''Der Frühling Kommt'' (Spring is coming), \n* ''Die Bergfee'' (The Mountain-fairy), \n* ''[[wikipedia:Rübezahl|Rübezahl]]'', \n* ''Waldmärchen'' (Forest fairy tales), \n* ''[[wikipedia:Hubertus|Hubertushirsch]]'' (Saint Hubert's Hart)\n\nand finally the reproduction of ''[[Der Berggeist]]'' (\"The Mountain-spirit\"), that [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] likened to the character of [[Gandalf]] the [[Wizards|wizard]].\n\n[[Humphrey Carpenter]] tells in his [[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography|Biography of the author]], that Tolkien kept this post card safe and later wrote 'Origin of Gandalf' on the card's envelope.<ref>{{B|II}}, p. 51</ref>\n\nThough Carpenter speculates, that Tolkien bought the post card already in his summer holidays [[1911]], when he was in Switzerland. This speculation is incorrect: as explained by [[Manfred Zimmermann]], the post card version of ''Der Berggeist'' was published in the late twenties. Interviewing the daughter of the artist (born [[1910]]), she gives the painting's date of origin also later, as she can remember when his father was painting it.<ref>[[Mythlore 34|''Mythlore'' 34]] ([[1983]]), [[Manfred Zimmermann]], \"[https://dc.swosu.edu/mythlore/vol9/iss4/7/ ''The Origin of Gandalf and Josef Madlener'']\", pp. 22-24</ref>\n\nThe original painting came to America after World War II, where it was later rediscovered. In [[2005]] it was sold at Sotheby's for £84000.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2005/english-literature-history-l05407/lot.423.html|articlename=Lot 423: Der Berggeist|dated=12 July 2005|website=[http://www.sothebys.com/en/ Sotheby's]|accessed=21 July 2023}}</ref>\n\nTolkien purchased at least one other Madlener postcard published by Ackermann's: [http://www.akpool.de/ansichtskarten/205063-kuenstler-ak-madlener-j-heilige-familie-esel-wald|\"Heilige Familie\"] (Holy Family), which he sent to [[Letter to Miss Kilbride|Katherine Kilbride on 24 December 1938]].\n\n==External links==\n* {{WP|Josef Madlener}}\n* [http://www.openpr.de/news/124016.html Article: ''Josef Madlener: Maler der schwäbischen Weihnacht''] '''(German)'''\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Madlener, Josef}}\n[[Category:Artists]]\n[[Category:German people]]\n[[Category:People by name]]\n[[de:Josef Madlener]]"}}}
