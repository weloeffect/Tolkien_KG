He was said to be the bravest of the [[Gondothlim]], save King [[Turgon]] himself.<ref name=Gondolin>{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|173}}\n\nWhen the [[Fall of Gondolin]] began, he and his folk were near the northern gate, where [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]] led the main attack of [[Melko]]'s armies. When the gates fell, he jumped upon the enemies with his folk and the [[house of the Hammer of Wrath]].<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|176}} But after [[Rog]] and those of the Hammer died outside the walls, the folk of the Tree retreated to the [[Square of the Folkwell]]. There they fought under the [[Arch of Inwë]] until [[Tuor]] entered the square carrying [[Ecthelion]] and being pursued by Orcs. \"There did Galdor become the salvation of Tuor\", because \"the Orcs had taken them both but for the sudden rush of that champion and the dint of his club.\"<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|181–2}}\n\nLater on, in the [[Square of the Palace]], Turgon proclaimed the fall of Gondolin, throwing his crown at the roots of [[Glingol]], and it was Galdor who picked the crown up, but the king rejected it.<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|185}} \n\nHe joined the [[exiles of Gondolin]], and after crossing [[Idril's secret way]], he encouraged them to run to the [[Encircling Mountains]] before the sunrise.<ref name=Gondolin />{{rp|189}} When they reached the [[Cristhorn]], he led a group of men ahead of the survivors. They were the first on crossing the narrow pass and had to fight against an ambush of the Orcs.<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|191–3}}\n\nGaldor lived later in the [[Mouths of Sirion|mouth of Sirion]] and survived the battle that Melko made against the people dwelling there. It is said that he later visited the ruins of Gondolin with [[Eärendel]] and now lives in [[Tol Eressëa]], where he still has followers.<ref>{{LT2|IIIn}}, p. 215</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[Gnomish]] name ''Galdor'' is never glossed, but in the [[Noldorin]] stage of the language, it is related with the [[root]]s [[GALA]]/[[GALAD]], related with \"thrive\" and \"trees\".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries \"[[GALA]]\", \"[[GALAD]]\"</ref>\n\nThe [[Qenya]] name of the character was '''''Aldaron''''',<ref>{{PE|13}}, p. 104</ref> which confirms this relation with the word \"tree\", as it is also the [[Aldaron|name]] of [[Oromë]] meaning \"(King) of the Forests\".<ref>{{LT1|III}}, p. 66</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn an outline of the last Lost Tale, Tolkien considered that both Galdor and [[Egalmoth]] led the Noldoli back to Valinor.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, pp. 278-9</ref>\n\nIn late writings, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] considered that Galdor of Gondolin and [[Galdor of the Havens]] may have been the same, but ultimately rejected the notion. If Galdor had remained behind, he would either have completely rejected the call of the [[Valar]], and thus had fallen, or he would have had to leave and then return like [[Glorfindel]] did, which would make him a far more powerful person than his appearance in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' suggests. For this reason Tolkien speculated that ''Galdor'' was simply a common [[Sindarin]] name.<ref>{{PM|Last}}, Glorfindel, pp. 387-8, notes 1 & 3</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n{{HousesofGondolin}} \n{{title}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Gnomes]]\n[[Category:Gnomish names]]\n[[Category:Gondolindrim]]\n\n[[de:Galdor (Hauptmann von Gondolin)]]\n[[fi:Galdor (Gondolin)]]"}}}
