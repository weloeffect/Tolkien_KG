Once cultivated by the [[Númenóreans]] like [[athelas]], it was later considered a nuisance by farmers and shepherds. Properly prepared and eaten, it induced vomiting that purged venom and neutralized poisons.<ref>{{Decipher|Wise}}, p. 84</ref>\n\n==Eater’s Leaf==\n'''''Eater’s Leaf''''' was an herb found in the [[Old Forest]] and valued in [[The Shire|the Shire]], especially by the [[Brandybuck family|Brandybucks]]. It fortified the digestive system, allowing heavy consumption of food and drink without ill effects, and granted resistance against poisons.<ref name=\"secondpage\">{{Decipher|Wise}}, p. 85</ref>\n\n==Equial==\n'''''Equial''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''sídhroch'', “horse-rest”) was a hardy weed found on the eastern slopes of the [[Misty Mountains]]. Used by the Rohirrim, it served as a mild anaesthetic for calming horses and other mounts. Frequent use, however, could prove deadly.<ref name=\"secondpage\"/>\n\n==Fresh Dew==\n'''''Fresh Dew''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''amrúnan'', “sunrise-gift”) was a small, leafy plant growing high in the Misty Mountains. Crushed, it produced a pungent odour that revived the weary. It could rouse the stunned or even restore those collapsed from exhaustion.<ref>{{Decipher|Wise}}, pp. 85-86</ref>\n\n==Gwathlas==\n'''''Gwathlas''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] “shadow-leaf”) was a leafy plant with a thick root, first cultivated by the [[Black Númenóreans]] under [[Sauron]]’s tutelage. Consuming the oil from its compressed roots sharpened the mind, allowing sorcerers to study dark lore more efficiently. In [[Gondor]], its use was outlawed and punishable by death.<ref name=\"thirdpage\">{{Decipher|Wise}}, p. 86</ref>\n\n==Naurant==\n'''''Naurant''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] “red-vein”) was a fern with crimson veins, found east of the Sirich River. Gondorian healers employed it as a sedative. <ref name=\"thirdpage\"/>\n\n==Soldier’s Root==\n'''''Soldier’s Root''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''dagorthond'', “battle-root”) was a rare plant with an orange, pulpy root, found along the [[Bruinen|Loudwater]] near [[Rivendell]]. It granted great strength but carried the dangerous side-effect of battle-fury, often leading to excessive violence. This led to Elves purging the plant on sights.<ref>{{Decipher|Wise}}, p. 87</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Materials from adaptations]]\n[[Category:LOTRRPG]]"}}}
