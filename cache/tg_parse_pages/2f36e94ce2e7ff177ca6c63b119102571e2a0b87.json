The fortresses were erected by Gondor to prevent evil creatures from returning to the Black Land. After the Great Plague, it was repopulated by the very Orcs and Trolls it was designed to forbid. \n\nNearly two hundred feet tall, the Teeth are known individually as Carchost (s. \"Fang-fort\") and Narchost (s. \"Fire-fort\"). These towers and their connecting rampart commands the gap between the Mountains of Ash and the Mountains of Shadow. Chiseled of smooth and glassy slag, they erupt from the tortured plain like huge ebony jaws poised to close upon the foolish intruder. \n\nTEETH OF MORDOR features: \n\n*Over 20 pages of layouts, perspectives, and illustrations. \n*Complete, multi-level layouts for Carchost, Narchost, and the central gate complex. \n*Garrison data for both Gondorian and Sauronic forces. \n*Stats and background for the Mouth of Sauron and Dwar of Waw, Nazgul commander of the Morannon.  \n\n==See also==\n\n*''[[Gates of Mordor (book)|Gates of Mordor]]''\n*''[[The Tower of Cirith Ungol and Shelob's Lair]]''\n*''[[Gorgoroth (book)|Gorgoroth]]''\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:MERP]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
