At the home of [[Tom Bombadil]], the ponies became friends with [[Fatty Lumpkin]], a pony of Tom's. At the [[Barrow-downs]] they became so frightened that they ran off to find Fatty. Tom called them all back with the names he had given them: [[Sharp-ears]], [[Bumpkin]], [[Wise-nose]], [[Swish-tail]], and White-socks.  Eventually they all returned with all the bagge, and went back on their journey with the Hobbits.<ref>{{FR|Bombadil}}</ref>\n\nDuring their stay at the ''[[Prancing Pony]]'' the Hobbits' ponies were let out to delay their departure from [[Bree]].<ref>{{FR|Strider}}</ref> They ran out in the  Downs to find Fatty. They stayed with Tom for a while, until he had heard news of the events at Bree. He sent the ponies to [[Barliman Butterbur]], and they stayed there working for Barliman, they were taken well cared for by [[Bob]].<ref>{{RK|Homeward}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Horses]]\n\n[[de:Weißstrumpf]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/animaux/chevaux/paturons blancs]]\n[[fi:Valkosukka]]"}}}
