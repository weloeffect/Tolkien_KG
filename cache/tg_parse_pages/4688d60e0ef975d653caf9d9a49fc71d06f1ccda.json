It is a collection of several essays.\n\n==From the publisher==\n\n{{blockquote|Tolkien’s Middle-earth and its legendarium have drawn extensive scholarly attention. But there is more to Tolkien than the history and legends of Middle-earth, and there has hitherto been a certain lack of academic criticism focused primarily on his shorter fictional works Farmer Giles of Ham, Smith of Wootton Major, Roverandom and his poetry. Although scholarly evaluations of these works exist, they often deal with the shorter texts more as an afterthought, as footnotes to the ‘major’ texts rather than as demanding attention in their own right. This dearth of studies suggests that it is time for a closer look at Tolkien’s 'Shorter Works'. The current volume collects the findings of a joint conference of Walking Tree Publishers and the German Tolkien Society at the Friedrich Schiller University in Jena, Germany in 2007. Various interesting aspects, details and connections are unearthed which are likely to broaden not simply the understanding of Tolkien’s Shorter Works, but also of the author’s overall fictional work as well as the man and author J.R.R. Tolkien himself.}}\n\n==Contents==\n* [[Margaret Hiley]] and [[Frank Weinreich]]: \"Introduction\" \n* [[Allan Turner]]: \"'Tom Bombadil': Poetry and Accretion\" \n* [[Guglielmo Spirito]]: \"Speaking With Animals: A Desire that Lies Near the Heart of Faërie\"\n* [[Marek Oziewicz]]: \"Setting Things Right in Farmer Giles of Ham and the Lord of the Rings: Tolkien's Conception of Justice\"\n* [[Vincent Ferré]]: \"The Rout of the King: Tolkien's Readings on Arthurian Kingship – Farmer Giles of Ham and The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth\"\n* [[Friedhelm Schneidewind]]: \"Farmer Giles of Ham: the Prototype of a Humorous Dragon Story\"\n* [[Patrick Brückner]]: \"'...
