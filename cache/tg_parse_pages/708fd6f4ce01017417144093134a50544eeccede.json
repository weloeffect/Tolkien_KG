Cotta’sche Buchhandlung Nachf. GmbH''', is a German publishing company.\n\nThe domicile of the book publisher is in [[wikipedia:Stuttgart|Stuttgart]], Germany. Klett-Cotta publishes books of diferent genres, from Fantasy, Nonfiction, History to books about Psychology, Educational science and Philosophy. \n\nDuring the 1960s Michael Klett (*[[1938]]), son of the former head of the publishing company Ernst Klett ([[1911]]- [[1998]]), effected, that [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' was incorporated in Klett's publishing program. \nThe book was declined by every greater German publishing house before. In [[1966]] Ernst Klett made [[Allen and Unwin|Allen & Unwin]] an official offer for the German publishing rights of ''The Lord of the Rings''.\n\nThe first German ''The Lord of the Rings''-edition, translated by [[Margaret Carroux]] and [[Ebba-Margareta von Freymann]], was published [[1969]]/[[1970|70]] under the title ''Der Herr der Ringe''. \nWith the second edition of [[1972]], Paperback and slipcase, ''Der Herr der Ringe'' became a success for Klett.\n\nThe publishing company was renamed after the merger of Ernst Klett and the publisher Cotta’sche Verlagsbuchhandlung in 1977. \n\nMost of Tolkien's works in German were and are published first or only by Klett-Cotta.\n\n== Links ==\n\n[http://www.klett-cotta.de/home/ Online presence of publisher Klett-Cotta]\n\n[[de:Klett-Cotta Verlag]]\n[[Category:German businesses]]\n[[Category:Publishers]]"}}}
