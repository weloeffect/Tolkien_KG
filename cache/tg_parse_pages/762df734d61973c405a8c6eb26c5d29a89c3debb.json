And woe to them, if we prove the swifter! We will make such a chase as shall be accounted a marvel among the Three Kindreds: Elves, Dwarves, and Men. Forth the Three Hunters!|Aragorn in ''[[The Two Towers]]'', \"[[The Departure of Boromir]]\"}}</center>\n\nThe \"'''Three Hunters'''\" was the name [[Aragorn]] gave to himself, [[Legolas]], and [[Gimli]] when they began pursuing the [[Uruk-hai]] who had captured [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and [[Peregrin Took]] by [[Nen Hithoel]] at the [[Breaking of the Fellowship]].\n\n==History==\nThe Three Hunters set out from Nen Hithoel on the evening of [[26 February]] {{TA|3019}}.<ref name=\"Great\">{{App|Great}}</ref> By Aragorn's tracking skill, they followed the Uruks' trail through the night across the [[Emyn Muil]], where they found five Orcs who had been slain by their own company. At dawn, they reached the [[East Wall of Rohan]] and descended into the [[Eastemnet]]. There, Aragorn found Pippin's [[Elven brooches|Elven brooch]], which the hobbit had dropped as a sign to any of the Fellowship who might follow them. \n\nThe companions continued swiftly across the plains of Rohan till nightfall, when they faced the dilemma of losing the trail in the dark or losing time by waiting for morning. Though in doubt, Aragorn chose to rest for the night. When they rose, they found that the Uruks had gone far ahead of them. They tirelessly pursued their quarry north-westward the rest of that day, but sensed the will of [[Saruman]] slowing them down and giving speed to the Uruks. They slept another night and marched another day, growing weary and losing hope.\n \nAfter another night's rest, they rose on [[30 February]]<ref name=\"Great\" /> and encountered [[Éomer]] and his [[éored]], who were returning to [[Edoras]] after slaughtering the Orc-band outside [[Fangorn Forest]] the day before. Suspicious of the travellers, Éomer sternly questioned them and almost came to blows with Gimli and Legolas, but Aragorn intervened and gave him an account of themselves and their journey. Éomer marvelled to find that the companions had travelled forty-five leagues<ref group=\"note\">That is, 135 miles or 217 kilometres.</ref> in only three days, for which he named Aragorn [[Wingfoot]]. Éomer told them about Rohan's troubles and requested their aid, but Aragorn refused to desert Merry and Pippin while hope of finding them remained. Acting against Rohan's law by letting strangers wander the land without the king's consent, Éomer lent them two horses, [[Hasufel]] and [[Arod]], and asked them to prove his trust by returning them to Edoras.\n \nWith their horses, the Three Hunters reached the eaves of Fangorn at evening. Finding no trace of the hobbits before dark, they camped there to wait for daylight. During the night they encountered a vanishing old man and found their horses missing. The next morning, on [[1 March]],<ref name=\"Great\" /> they found signs of the hobbits that led them into Fangorn, where they met [[Gandalf|Gandalf the White]]. Gandalf shared news and insight with them, among which was that the hobbits were safe with [[Treebeard]]. The three companions discovered that Hasufel and Arod had met Gandalf's horse [[Shadowfax]] in the night, and they rode with Gandalf to the aid of Rohan at Edoras. \n\nLater, after the [[Battle of the Hornburg]] and the Ents' destruction of Isengard, the Three Hunters, in the company of Gandalf and the Rohirrim, reunited with Merry and Pippin at Isengard on [[5 March]].<ref name=\"Great\" /> The Fellowship's paths diverged afterwards, but Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli remained constant companions to the end of the [[War of the Ring]].\n \n{{references|notes}}\n[[Category:Epithets]]\n[[fi:Kolme ajomiestä]]"}}}
