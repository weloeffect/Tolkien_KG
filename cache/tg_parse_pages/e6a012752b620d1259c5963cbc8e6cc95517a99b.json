He was the captain of a group of Mordor-orcs which had joined [[Uglúk]]'s forces on the plains of [[Rohan]] during the [[War of the Ring]]. When Pippin awoke and heard the Orcs arguing he noted that Grishnákh's voice sounded softer but more evil than the others. Grishnákh threatened to report the doings of the mountain-orcs and of Uglúk to Lugbúrz ([[Barad-dûr]]).<ref name=\"Uruk\"/>\n\nOn [[28 February]]<ref name=\"Great\"/> Grishnákh and his followers split from Uglúk's company to head east, but fell back in with the [[Orcs of Isengard|Isengarders]] when [[Éomer]]'s riders drew near. In the nighttime when he had a chance, Grishnákh attempted to search the hobbits for [[the One Ring]] (how he knew about it is unknown; possibly he was present at the torture and interrogation of [[Gollum]] in Barad-dûr). After hearing Pippin imitate Gollum's croaking noise, he believed they had the One Ring and tried to escape with the two hobbits. Before he could accomplish this he was slain by the Riders of [[Éomer]] near the eaves of [[Fangorn Forest]].<ref name=\"Uruk\"/>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nThe earlier form of the name ''Grishnákh'' used by [[Tolkien]] was ''Gríshnák''.<ref>{{TI|XXI}}, p. 409.
