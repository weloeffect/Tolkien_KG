The island was roughly four times longer than it was wide, and its long axis lined up with the Firth.<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>  There is no mention of the island in the annals of the [[First Age]] so it may have been uninhabited.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name is never glossed, but it is proably related with the word ''[[enedh]]'' (\"centre, middle\").\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn the \"[[Map of Beleriand and the Lands to the North]]\" in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' the island was shown but unnamed.  In ''[[The War of the Jewels]]'', [[Christopher Tolkien]] said of the [[The Second 'Silmarillion' Map|Second ''Silmarillion'' Map]] that over the years it had become covered with alterations and additions of names and features.  On Sheet 1 of this map the island bears the name \"Ened\" - concerning the name Christopher stated that he could cast no light.<ref>{{WJ|Beleriand}}, p. 181</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Islands]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]"}}}
