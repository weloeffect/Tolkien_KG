Tolkien]]'s B.Litt. (''Bachelor of Literature'' or ''Bachelor of Letters'') students (starting on [[20 January|January 20]], [[1952]]). During four years he worked on his thesis on the [[Middle English]] fabliau (comic bourgeois tale) ''Dame Sirith'', examined by Tolkien and [[G.V Smithers]] on [[2 March|March 2]], [[1956]].<ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond|Hammond, Wayne G.]] and [[Christina Scull|Scull, Christina]], ''[[The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide]]: Chronology'', first reference p. 382, last p. 486.</ref>\n\nMiller and Tolkien seem to have continued staying in touch. In [[1971]], he sent Tolkien a copy of C.T. Onions' ''Modern English Syntax'' (the revised edition by Miller, published in the same year). Tolkien replied to Miller on [[21 June|June 21]], thanking for the gift (see letter ''[[Letter to Brian Miller]]'').\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Authors|Miller, Brian]]\n[[Category:Letter receivers|Miller, Brian]]\n[[Category:Linguists|Miller, Brian]]\n[[Category:British people|Miller, Brian]]\n[[Category:People by name|Miller, Brian]]"}}}
