The [[Harfoots]] moved in {{TA|1050}} while the [[Fallohides]] and [[Stoors]] made the journey c. {{TA|1150|n}}.<ref name=\"Great\">{{App|Great}}</ref> The Harfoots settled between [[Weathertop]] and the mountains, the Stoors dwelt between [[Tharbad]] and [[Dunland]], and the Fallohides mingled with the others (often becoming leaders among the Harfoot and Stoor clans).<ref name=\"Hobbits\">{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>\n\nAround {{TA|1300}} the realm of [[Angmar]] arose and the Hobbits began moving west again, with many settling in [[Bree]]. Finally, in {{TA|1601}}, King [[Argeleb II]] granted the Hobbits land beyond the [[Baranduin]] when the majority of them moved and established the Shire.<ref name=\"Great\"/> By the time of [[Bilbo Baggins]] all of the earlier settlements had vanished and been forgotten, except for those Hobbits still living in Bree and its environs.<ref name=\"Hobbits\"/>\n\n==Note==\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] never referred to the \"Forgotten Villages\" by name; they were given this identification in ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]''.<ref>[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]], ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'', Migrations of the Hobbits</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Remnants of the Hobbit migration can be found in [[Eriador]]. In the [[Angle]], rotting and long-abandoned holes of the [[Stoors]] are tucked into corners of the landscape. Up north in the [[Ettenmoors]] exists an isolated Hobbit village of \"Hoarhallow\".\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Eriador]]\n[[Category:Cities, towns and villages]]"}}}
