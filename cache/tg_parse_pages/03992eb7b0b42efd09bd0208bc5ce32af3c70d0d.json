The fragments were written in unknown dates, in the time between the composition of ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' and [[The Earliest 'Silmarillion']].\n\n==Synopsis==\n===First fragment===\nEntitled ''Turlin and the Exiles of Gondolin'', this fragment is narrated by [[Ilfiniol]]. This version differs from ''[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]'' in some points: [[Ulmo]] wished to help the [[Gnomes]] against [[Melko]], but he despaired with them, as all their messengers fail to reach [[Valinor]], so he decides a new plan. After the [[Battle of Unnumbered Tears]], there were kindreds of [[Men]] living in [[Dor-Lómin]]. There was a kindred called ''Tunglin'' or \"Folk of the Harp\", and Turgon (here [[Tuor]]) son of [[Peleg]] was one of them. But he liked to dwell alone and the friendship of the Elves. So he departed from his people and dwelt wildly in the mountains, singing in the mists of [[Mithrim]]. In one of his wanderings, destiny led him to a [[Annon-In-Gelydh|hidden cave]] in the rocks created by the Gnomes, and some of them guided him along the dark passages until he came out into the light.\n\n[[Tolkien]] first used the name ''Turlin'', but changed it to ''Turgon''. [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]] is interested in the origins of Tuor's people: they were summoned to the Battle, but too late, which must be connected with the coming of the [[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterlings]] in later versions. This Battle must be in the 'Vale of Ninniach', whose name was later applied to the [[Cirith Ninniach]]. The kindred of Tuor is the Folk of the Harp, whereas in the previous and later versions he belonged to the [[House of the Swan]].<ref>{{SM|P1}}, p. 5</ref>\n\n===Second fragment===\nThe previous fragment finishes there, but the next one continues directly in the same manuscript. This develops the story of the [[Exile of the Noldor|Exile of the Noldoli]], that only had been outline in [[Gilfanon's Tale]].\n\nThe text begins with [[Gelmir]] (here [[Finwë]]) speaking to the exiled Gnomes when they arrive to the [[Great Lands]], saying that they do not know what is going to come thereafter, but that even their torments until then will be remembered by all the Elves and even the other Children of [[Ilúvatar|Ior]]. Then the Gnomes dwelt in the northwestern shores for a long time, resting of their anguish. Some of them explored the lands, trying to find Melko and the stolen treasures. Thereafter all the folk moved inland with the armies of Gonfin and Delin ahead. Then the ice of the Earth melted and the Elves began to sing and play harps and pipes, and trees and flowers grew with the sound of their music. Of all those hosts, the most eager was [[Fëanor]]'s and his [[Sons of Fëanor|Seven Sons]]. \n[[File:Quentandil - Gnome Banners.jpg|250px|right]]\nThen the Gnomes arrived into a land where they discovered nothing, as it was a land covered in mist, so they called it [[Dor-Lómin]]. There they rest in the waters of [[Lake Mithrim]], building dwellings in its shores. King Gelmir had three armies under his command: one of swordsmen led by his son Golfin, a second of spears by his son Delin, and a third of bowmen by Lúthien (not the other [[Lúthien]]). All banners of the Gnomes were gold and white in memory of the [[Two Trees]], and were wrought by the sons of Fëanor, so with sewed jewels they shone even in the dark: Gelmir's was a crown of gold upon a silver field, Golfin's a silver sword upon gold, Delin's a green beech leaf upon silver diapered with golden flowers, and Lúthien's a golden swallow upon azure field.\n\nHowever, Fëanor left once with a small company and three of his sons, and they went beyond the hills of Dor-Lómin, beyond north [[Artanor]], and they found a great valley with a red light afar off. While they explored the valley, they found an armed company camped around a fire, and Fëanor yelled at them, asking if they were Elves. Then the clamour of the camped folk broke forth in the vale, and Fëanor knew they were not Elves and ran back swiftly with his men.\n\nThe text was abruptly abandoned at this point. Christopher highlights the apparition of the Elven houses, although unrelated with Fëanor and his sons. The relation of Gelmir and the later [[Finwë]] is clear: the names are formally related, as Finwë Nóleme had been previously called ''Fin'''golma''''';<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, p. 263, entry \"Nólemë\"</ref> also, the name of his son ''Golfin'' will evolve to ''Fin'''golfin''''', name that will appear for first time also as the son of a Gelmir.<ref>{{LB|2c}}, pp. 146-147</ref> Of the other sons of Gelmir ([[Delin]] and [[Lúthien (son of Gelmir)|Lúthien]]) there is no trace elsewhere.\n\nIt is certainly clear that ''Golfin'' here is the first appearance of [[Fingolfin]] in the [[legendarium]]. On the other hand, the obscure matter of the death of Fëanor seems here clarified, as Christopher assumes that the text would continue with the death of Fëanor against the Orcs they found in the vale. Here also appear for first time the ideas of the Gnomes bringing arms from Valinor and the flowers springing beneath the marching hosts.<ref>{{SM|P2}}, pp. 8-9</ref>\n\n===Third fragment===\nThe third fragment is from an isolated slip of paper, an sketch rethinking the Lost Tale of the [[The Flight of the Noldoli|Flight of the Noldoli]], given here in full:\n\n{{blockquote|The Trees stand dark. The Plain is full of trouble. The Gnomes gather by torchlight in Tûn or Côr; Fëanor laments Bruithwir (Felegron) [emended to (Feleor)] his father, bids Gnomes depart & seek Melko and their treasures —he longs for the [[Silmarils]]— Finweg & Fingolfin speak against him. The Gnomes shout and prepare to depart. The [[Solosimpi]] refuse: the wise words of Ethlon (Dimlint). Foamriders [?beaches]. The threats of Fëanor to march to Cú nan Eilch. The arch, the lamplit quays; they seize the boats. One [[Gilfanon (elf of Alqualondë)|Gilfanon]] sees his mighty swanwinged swan-feather boat with red oars [?going] & he & his sons run to the arch and threaten the Gnomes. The fight on the arch & Gilfanon's [?curse] ere they throw him to the waves. The Gnomes reach Fangros & repent — burn the boats.}}\n\nLike in the Lost Tale, [[Bruithwir]] is still the father of Fëanor, but Finweg and Fingolfin appear now in the scene. There are some narratives features that never appear before or after this fragment and Christopher ignores what lay behind them: 'the wise words of [[Ethlon]] (Dimlint)' and 'the threats of Fëanor to march to Cú nan Eilch'. The name ''Fangros'' appears once elsewhere in ''[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]'',<ref>{{LB|1c}}, p. 31, v. 631</ref> but there is no clue of what would happen in Fangros. There is also no previous or later trace of the burning of the boats coming from repentance. Here [[Gilfanon (elf of Alqualondë)|Gilfanon]] is an Elf of [[Alqualondë]], but Christopher is certain that he cannot be the [[Gilfanon]] of [[Tavrobel]].<ref>{{SM|P3}}, pp. 9-10</ref>\n{{References}}"}}}
