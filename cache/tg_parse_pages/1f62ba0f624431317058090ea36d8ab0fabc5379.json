The Elves of Eregion were primarily [[Noldor]]. [[Celebrimbor]], a Noldorin smith who had accompanied Galadriel and Celeborn, and other elven smiths founded the [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain]], a brotherhood of Elven craftsmen.<ref name=Concerning/>\n\nAround {{SA|750}} the [[Noldor]] started to build Ost-in-Edhil.<ref name=Concerning/> The Elves of Ost-in-Edhil also built<ref>{{FR|Journey}} \"the Elven-way from Hollin\", p. 303</ref> a highroad that connected the city with the west gate of Khazad-dûm.<ref name=Rings/>\n\nIn {{SA|1200|n}} a mysterious craftsman named [[Annatar]] came to the city. Annatar claimed to have been sent as an emissary by the [[Valar]] to aid the Elves. Although [[Galadriel]] did not trust Annatar and treated him with contempt, Annatar reacted with patience and courtesy, because he wanted to avoid an open conflict with her at the moment. Annatar was more successful to by accepted by the smiths of the Gwaith-i-Mírdain and in secret instructed them in the art of smithing. After some time the Gwaith-i-Mírdain fell under his influence.<ref name=Concerning/>\n\nBetween {{SA|1350}} and {{SA|1400|n}} Annatar persuaded the Gwaith-i-Mírdain to rebel against the rule of Galadriel and Celeborn and to seize control over the elven realm of Eregion. As a consequence Galadriel left Eregion with her daugther [[Celebrian]] and travelled through Khazad-dûm to the elven realm of [[Lothlórien|Lórinand]]. Celeborn did not want to enter Khazad-dûm and stayed in Eregion where he was ignored by Celebrimbor.<ref name=Concerning/>\n\nAfter the Gwaith-i-Mírdain started to forge the [[Rings of Power]] Annatar left Eregion around {{SA|1500}}<ref name=Concerning/> and returned to [[Mordor]].
