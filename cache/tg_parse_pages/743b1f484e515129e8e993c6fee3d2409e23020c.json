The Fallohides were the least numerous of the three branches, and originally roamed the northern parts of the [[Westlands]].<ref name=\"hobbits\">{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>\n\nThey were more friendly with Elves than the other Hobbits were, and had more skill in language and song than in handicrafts; and of old they preferred hunting to tilling. \n\n==Characteristics==\nIn appearance, Fallohides were taller and slimmer of build than the other [[Hobbits]],<ref name=\"hobbits\"/> with some growing to four feet or more in height. Both their skin and their hair tended to be fair,<ref name=\"hobbits\"/> and no Fallohide ever grew a beard.\n\nWhile the other two branches of hobbit-kind were pastoral and rustic in nature, the Fallohides retained a hunting tradition, and so were naturally bolder and more inquisitive than their relatives, but less gifted in the arts of farming and agriculture.<ref name=\"hobbits\"/>\n\nAs Fallohidish culture was much more open to outside influence than that of the Stoors or Harfoots, they were friendlier with the other [[races]] of [[Middle-earth]] than their cousins, especially with the [[Elves]]. This was consistent with their skill in both song and speech, and their love for trees and of woodlands.<ref name=\"hobbits\"/>\n\n==History==\nThe Fallohides seem to have dwelt originally under the southern eaves of [[Greenwood]]. Then, in {{TA|1050}}, they flew the shadow and settled at the northern part of the River [[Anduin]]. But this migration was not enough to avoid the [[Necromancer|Shadow]] and one century after the [[Harfoots]], the Fallohides deserted their northern homes in around {{TA|1150}},<ref name=\"TA\">{{App|TA}}</ref> and crossed the Mountains to the north of [[Rivendell]].<ref name=\"hobbits\"/>\n\nThe tribes of the Fallohidish Hobbits travelled slowly down the course of the [[Hoarwell]], and westward across [[Eriador]]. They eventually join their cousins near [[Weathertop]], where they mingled and where their adventurous and intrepid natures made them natural leaders of the other Hobbits they found there.<ref name=\"hobbits\"/> They migrated then with them into the region around [[Bree]], in c.{{TA|1300}}.<ref name=\"TA\"/>\n\nThree hundred years later (in the year {{TA|1601}}),<ref name=\"TA\"/> two Fallohide brothers, [[Marcho]] and [[Blanco]], travelled westward again from Bree with their followers and crossed the Bridge of Stonebows (later the [[Brandywine Bridge]]). They settled in the empty land that they found there and were granted it by King [[Argeleb II]] of [[Arthedain]], in whose realm it lay. This was the land that was to become known as [[the Shire]].<ref name=\"hobbits\"/>\n\nAs the centuries passed, the three distinct strains of the Hobbits gradually began to disappear as they mingled with one another in the Shire. Nonetheless, Fallohides were long found as chieftains among Stoor and Harfoot clans, and there were families that retained a strong line of Fallohidish blood (and the impetuosity that went with it). At the time of the [[War of the Ring]], the Fallohidish line was still well represented in the families of the [[Took Family|Tooks]], the [[Bolger Family|Bolgers]] and the [[Brandybuck Family|Brandybucks]].<ref name=\"hobbits\"/>\n\nIn some old families, especially those of Fallohide origin, it was the custom to give high-sounding first-names such as [[Isengrim (disambiguation)|Isengrim]].<ref>{{App|F2}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Fallohide'' is a translation of an archaic [[Hobbitish]] word.\n\nThe word derived from the archaic English words ''fallow'', meaning \"pale, yellowish\" (not now in use, except in \"fallow deer\"), and ''hide'' (which is no longer applied to human skin). In modern English, ''Fallohide'' would be rendered as 'Paleskin'.<ref name=\"Nomen\">{{HM|N}}, p. 757</ref>\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Races of Hobbits]]\n[[Category:Fallohides]]\n[[de:Falbhäute]]\n[[fr:encyclo/peuples/hobbits/pales]]\n[[fi:Helokesit]]"}}}
