Taking place over the night of the [[3 March|3]]-[[4 March]] {{TA|3019}}, it saw the attacking [[Isengard]]-host of [[Saruman]] defeated by the [[Rohirrim]] led by [[Théoden]] and [[Erkenbrand]].\n\n==Strategy and array==\n===Rohan===\nThe army of Rohan consisted of 1000 cavalry forces from [[Edoras]] led by [[King of Rohan|King]] Théoden.  This force included [[Aragorn]], [[Gimli]], [[Legolas]], and Théoden's nephew [[Éomer]]. This army joined with Rohan's garrison of around 1000 at the [[Hornburg]].\n\nThe army was reinforced by 1000 scattered Rohirrim troops from the [[Westfold]] rallied by the [[Wizards|Wizard]] [[Gandalf]] and led by [[Erkenbrand]]. A forest of [[Huorns]] entered the valley independently, seeking revenge on Saruman's Orcs.\n\n===Isengard===\nThe army of the corrupted Wizard [[Saruman]], amassed both in service and in competition of his [[Dark Lord|Lord]] [[Sauron]], consisted of [[Orcs of Isengard|his Orcs]],<ref name=\"Deep\">{{TT|Deep}}, p. 533</ref> including his specially bred [[Uruk-hai]]<ref>{{TT|Deep}}, p. 540</ref> and [[Half-orcs]],<ref>{{TT|Flotsam}}, p. 566</ref> supported by [[Dunlendings]].<ref name=\"Deep\" /><ref>{{RK|Company}}, p. 777</ref> It was mentioned to consist of \"about ten thousand Orcs\", with an unknown but far smaller number of Dunlendings.<ref>{{TT|Flotsam}}, p. 570</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Prelude===\nOn [[March 3]], seeking to take the fight away from his people, [[Théoden]] brought around a thousand horsemen to the [[Fords of Isen]] along with any others in [[Edoras]]. On their way they found [[Ceorl]] who reported a defeat to the Fords; King Théoden then redirected his troops to Helm's Deep, which was commanded by [[Gamling]] in his lord [[Erkenbrand]]'s absence.\n\n===Battle===\nThe forces from [[Isengard]] arrived at the valley of [[Helm's Deep]] in the middle of the night and quickly scaled over the first defence, [[Helm's Dike]], and attempted to break down the fortress's gate with a battering ram. But [[Aragorn]], [[Éomer]], and some other Rohirrim attacked, through a postern gate on the side of the Hornburg, scattering the forces threatening the doors.\n\nThe Orcs and Dunlendings then raised hundreds of ladders to scale the wall. Aragorn and Éomer had to repeatedly move the defenders, who were getting weary, to repel the Orcs coming up the ladders and crossing the wall. However, some Orcs had crept in though a culvert which let a stream out of Helm's Deep, and while the defenders were busy with the assault on the wall, they suddenly attacked, having made it past the wall. The defenders quickly reacted and drove back the Orcs, and the culvert was blocked up under supervision by [[Gimli]].\n\n[[File:John Howe - The Charge of the Rohirrim at Helm's Deep.jpg|thumb|left|''The Charge of the Rohirrim at Helm's Deep'' by [[John Howe]]]]\nHowever, the enemies reentered the culvert and caused an explosion using a device of [[Saruman]]'s. This made a wide hole in the wall, and the Isengarders could not be stopped. The defenders retreated to the [[Glittering Caves]] and to the Hornburg. Soon Saruman's forces used their blasting fire to gain entrance to the keep. At this moment, however, the horn of Helm's Deep was sounded, and after a moment a sortie led by Théoden and Aragorn rode forth, followed by men on foot from the keep, and the defenders of the caves, who made a break-out attempt and were driving the enemy out of the deep. Théoden and Aragorn cut through the Orcs and Dunlendings and arrived at Helm's Dike.\n\nBoth armies then noticed that many trees, [[Huorns]], had moved to block a possible escape route for the Orcs. Then [[Gandalf]], [[Erkenbrand]], and a thousand men on foot from the Westfold arrived, and charged. The Dunlendings were so terrified of Gandalf that they could no longer fight. The Orcs lost control and ran into the trees, where the Huorns destroyed them. Thus, Rohan won the battle.\n\n===Aftermath===\nAfter the battle those Dunlendings who surrendered were given amnesty by King Théoden and allowed to return to home. The Rohirrim required that all hostilities cease, and that the Dunlendings retreat behind the [[Isen]] river again. The slain Dunlendings were buried in a mound of their own apart from the Orc carcasses.  The next night those carcasses disappeared and the [[Death Down]] was left by the departing Huorns.<ref>{{TT|III8}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''\n:The Battle of the Hornburg is turned into the climax of the second movie, and thus the build-up to it is altered significantly. Furthermore, this build-up is given far more prominence in the narrative in order to better set up the conflict as the film's third act climax. Considering the fact that Tolkien suggested cutting the battle completely in his commentary on Zimmerman's film script, it is probably given more prominence than he likely intended. This film-based battle is referred to as the \"Battle of Helm's Deep,” a title which was never used by Tolkien but is often used by fans due to its occupying the chapter entitled \"Helm's Deep.\"\n\n:The greatest differences largely stem from the events preceding the battle: in the book, the army of the Rohirrim seeks to confront Saruman's army at the [[Fords of Isen]] when they decide to redirect to the Deep, where the refugees of the Westfold have fled, and anticipate the forces of Isengard. In the film, the entirety of Rohan's people, men, women, and children, are relocated to the Deep for protection against Saruman's Orcs who also find and hunt them. In the book, only the women and children of Westfold are there. The Battle is given a sadistic and somewhat excessive weight as women and children hide in the [[Glittering Caves]] and the very existence of the Rohirrim is decided by the outcome. \n\n:Another major difference is that [[Elrond]], at the prompting of [[Galadriel]], sends a contingent of [[Elves|Elven]] archers to reinforce the defence of the keep. It's unclear how Elrond, who was in Rivendell, was able to send an army of Lórien Elves, as well as have them arrive at the Hornburg before the battle started.\n\n:In the book, it is never made explicitly clear by what method the Uruk-hai cause the explosion that blasts a hole in the Deeping Wall, with Aragorn merely hinting at \"some devilry of Orthanc\".  It's not clear whether this was some magical attack caused by Saruman from Orthanc (similar to the avalanche on Caradhras in the first movie), or some sort of invention of Saruman's.  The movie explicitly shows that Saruman, fitting with his theme of misusing his knowledge to empower his armies with a sort of proto-Industrial Revolution, makes his own gunpowder and uses it to make blasting charges that the Uruk-hai then ignite.\n\n:In the movie, the thousands of troops of Saruman lay siege to the fortress, which is defended by around 300 men (many of whom were, in fact, depicted as children or elders, to add further anxiety and villainy to the events) which the Rohirrim could muster and the aforementioned Elven Archers. When Legolas says there are \"300\" Rohirrim there he may have meant ''at that time'' as more were fleeing to the fortress, because visually there are more than 300 Rohirrim appearing on screen in the battle. This reference to \"300 against 10,000\" was probably meant as a reference to the ancient Battle of Thermopylae. These forces suffer heavy losses, but hold out till dawn when Gandalf arrives with thousands of riders who finally turn the tide of the battle and send Saruman's forces into retreat. These riders are led by Éomer in the film, whereas they are led by Erkenbrand in the book.\n\n'''2013 : ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Helm's Deep]]'':'''\n:The Battle of the Hornburg is a key part of the Epic Storyline of this expansion.\n\n{{References}}\n==External links==\n*[http://acoup.blog/2020/05/01/collections-the-battle-of-helms-deep-part-i-bargaining-for-goods-at-helms-gate/ Bret Devereaux, The Battle of Helm's Deep, an analysis of the film version of this battle that also discusses the books.]\n[[Category:Conflicts of the War of the Ring]]\n[[Category:Sieges]]\n[[de:Schlacht um die Hornburg]]\n[[fi:Ämyrilinnan taistelu]]"}}}
