Valar.|''[[The Silmarillion]]'', \"[[Valaquenta]]: Of the Valar\"}}\n\n'''Ulmo''' was a [[Valar|Vala]], also known as ''King of the Sea'', ''Lord of Waters'', and ''Dweller of the Deep''.<ref name=\"UT1\">{{UT|1}}</ref> One of the mightiest of the [[Ainur]], he was third in majesty of the [[Aratar]], after [[Manwë]] and [[Varda]].\n\nAt several points Ulmo was notable for setting himself apart from his brethren, and also for being the friendliest to the [[Children of Eru]].\n\n==Attributes==\nUlmo was the Lord of Waters and King of the Sea.<ref name=vala>{{S|IIb}}</ref> He was the Ainu most deeply instructed in music, and it was said that in water the [[Eldar]] could hear the echo of the [[Music of the Ainur]].<ref name=ai>{{S|I}}</ref> He lived in the deeps under [[Ambar]] who alone saw where he devised his music and whence he governed all waters, bays and rivers.<ref name=s1/><ref name=vala/>\n\nFrom the beginning Manwë had been his closest friend and ally and they came together when the vapors of the water become clouds high in the air, or mists and dew. The two most faithfully served the purpose of Eru.<ref name=ai/>\n\nUlmo was unique among the Valar in several ways; he was alone, taking no spouse among the [[Valier]]; he didn't dwell in [[Valinor]] but in [[Ekkaia]] from the beginning, preferring the deeps of the seas around and below [[Ambar]], and the rivers. He seldom appeared to the councils of his brethren, save in matters of great importance.<ref name=vala/> \n\nLikewise, he seldomly wore a [[fana]] and rather came to the shores unseen or entered firths of the sea and rivers. It was said his spirit was in the very veins of the world. He spoke through the sound of water, and made music with his horns the [[Ulumúri]]. But whenever he appeared, he was dreadful and terrible \"as a mounting wave that strides to the land\"; he wore a dark foam-crested helm and a shimmering silver-green mail, and his voice was deep like the ocean.<ref name=vala/>  \n\nUlmo cared about Arda and the Children of Eru, and through the veins of the world he kept in touch with them and saw every grief and need, and thus knew more of the goings on with them than even Manwë. Even while the Valar were secluded in Valinor or when the Children were under the wrath of his brethren, Ulmo, alone of the Valar, was the one who never forsook them.<ref name=s1>{{S|1}}</ref><ref name=vala/> However, it was not done as rebellion towards other Valar, but because it was a role to which he was \"appointed ere the making of the World\".<ref name=\"UT1\">{{UT|1}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nUlmo was very close in friendship to Manwë before [[Ea]] was made, and although Manwë was the most dear to [[Ilúvatar]], of all the Ainur Ulmo was most deeply instructed in music. Ulmo with Manwë and [[Aulë]] were the architects of [[Arda]].<ref name=ai /> Ulmo's vassal [[Ossë]], and Ossë's spouse [[Uinen]] were, to the elves, the best known of the [[Maiar]]. Through them Ulmo would learn much of the elves.<ref name=vala/>\n\nWhen the Valar retreated to [[Valinor]], Ulmo remained to the Outer Sea, and while his brethren neglected the [[Outer Lands]] during the [[Sleep of Yavanna]], Ulmo kept the earth alive under the darkness.<ref name=s1>{{S|1}}</ref> \n\nHe seldomly came to the Councils of [[Máhanaxar]], such as the time when the Valar were to prepare to [[Battle of the Powers|attack]] Melkor's fortress of [[Utumno]]. He also was the chief of a minority of the Valar who believed that the Elves should remain free in [[Middle-earth]], and order and heal the hurts of the land with their skills and grace, but this opinion was overruled.<ref>{{S|3}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless he eventually helped them get to Aman, because he knew that was what they wanted, and he accepted that. He tore a great piece of land off the shores of [[Beleriand]] and used it to transport the Eldar to the blessed coasts of Aman. He anchored the island (it was renamed [[Tol Eressëa]]) in the [[Bay of Eldamar]], which he did because he knew the minds of the [[Teleri]].\n\nWhen the time came for Melkor to be given a second chance and was pardoned, Ulmo and [[Tulkas]] were still distrustful of him, but both obeyed Manwë's bidding.<ref>{{S|6}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[First Age]] Ulmo protected [[Sirion]] and [[Gelion]] and directed more than any other Vala the [[Children of Ilúvatar]]. He urged [[Turgon]] to build [[Gondolin]] and [[Finrod]] to build [[Nargothrond]]. \n\nHe chose [[Tuor]] as his instrument before his birth, by helping [[Huor]] and [[Húrin]] reach [[Gondolin]] and telling [[Turgon]] to accept him, as aid would come from the [[House of Hador]]. Years later, he guided [[Tuor]] directing him to Gondolin as a messenger for Turgon. Despite [[Ulmo's warning]], Turgon chose not to abandon Gondolin. Tuor eventually married Turgon's daughter [[Idril]] and fathered [[Eärendil]] the [[Half-elven]]; Ulmo saved [[Elwing]] from the sack of the Havens of [[Sirion]], and thus she took the [[Silmarils|Silmaril]] to her husband Eärendil which allowed them to gain admittance to Valinor and plead for their mercy.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Ulmo'' is said to derive from the [[Valarin]] '''''Ullubōz'''''.<ref name=Quendi>{{WJ|AD1}}</ref>\n\nAlternatively, ''Ulmo'' is a [[Quenya]] title, which means \"the Pourer\", from ''[[ulya-]]'' (\"to pour\") + ''[[-mo]]'' (agentive ending \"-er\").<ref name=Quendi />\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn the earlier writings his [[Gnomish]] name was ''Gulma''.<ref>{{LT2|Appendix}}, p. 349, note \"Ulmonan\"</ref> Later his Gnomish name was  '''''Ylmir'''''<ref>{{LB|1d}}, p. 93</ref><ref>{{SM|2}}, p. 13</ref> (see [[Tuor]]'s ''[[The Horns of Ylmir]]'').
