In an interview with [[wikipedia:Gamespot|Gamespot]], Andrew Shiozaki, senior brand manager of Vivendi, explained that Vivendi had reviewed their complete line-up of [[Middle-earth]] video games, which besides Treason of Isengard included ''[[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|The Hobbit]]'', the [[The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring|''War of the Ring'' strategy game]] and the MMORPG ''[[Middle-earth Online]]'' (which eventually was released as ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'' by [[Turbine]]). It was deemed that Treason of Isengard failed the standards that Vivendi had set for their Middle-earth video games and was therefore cancelled. Instead, they focussed on the remaining three video games.<ref name=\"Gamespot-interview\"/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nBrad Spear, who previously composed music for the ''Fellowship of the Ring'' video game, composed original music for Treason of Isengard, as well as tracks based on themes composed by [[Chance Thomas]] for ''[[Middle-earth Online]]'' (which later became known as ''The Lord of the Rings Online'').
