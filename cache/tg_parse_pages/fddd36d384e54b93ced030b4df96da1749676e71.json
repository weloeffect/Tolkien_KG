It appears in their third full-length album, [[Third Age of the Sun]].\n==Lyrics==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nLight seems fair and proud \nFirst borns noble crowd \nOpen hearts uncorrupted \nMaintain eternal tranquillity \n\nBeast, filthy kind \nSick soul, broken mind \nLight burns their blackened eyes \nSpoiled blood, impure heart \n\nSee their purest forms \nHear high minded thoughts \nDenote the total contrast of \nThe race made by Morgoth \n\nStretched elven bodies \nTorture pestilential \nDark side of the distant stars \nUnnatural creation \n\nIronic how they were taken \nSo far from each other \nDeepest dark, merest light \nFrom the one and the same awakening \n\nCunning was the plan of Morgoth \nThose foolish did all the work \nHe came and culled the harvest \nBred the fruits for his purpose \nUnaware folk of the stars \nForced into wounds and dreadful scars \nTo raid the lands under his summons \nDestroy the race that they once were\n\n</poem>\n[[Category:Songs by Battlelore]]"}}}
