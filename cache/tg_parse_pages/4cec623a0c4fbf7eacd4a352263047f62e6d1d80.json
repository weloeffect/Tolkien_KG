During the [[War of the Ring]], it was attacked by [[Corsairs of Umbar]] and [[Haradrim]]. The fishing village of \"Gaerlond\" and the inland village of \"Tungobel\" were both burned, the lighthouse of \"Barad Rill\" was toppled, and the [[Warning beacons of Gondor|beacon]] \"Dol Brannor\" was seized by the Enemy. The river [[Gilrain]] and the city of [[Linhir]] formed the eastern border. The hills to the west, between Dor-en-Ernil and the Havens of [[Belfalas]] were mostly inaccessible but were identified in dialogue as the \"Emyn Ernil\".\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Regions of Gondor]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n\n[[de:Dor-en-Ernil]]\n[[fi:Dor-en-Ernil]]"}}}
