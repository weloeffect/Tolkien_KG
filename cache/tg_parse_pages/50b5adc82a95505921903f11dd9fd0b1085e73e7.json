We’re in one, of course; but I mean: put into words, you know, told by the fireside, or read out of a great big book with red and black letters, [[Later Ages|years and years afterwards]]. And people will say: ‘Let’s hear about Frodo and the Ring!’ And they’ll say: ‘Yes, that’s one of my favourite stories. Frodo was very brave, wasn’t he, dad?’ ‘Yes, my boy, the famousest of the hobbits, and that’s saying a lot.’|[[Sam Gamgee]]<ref>{{TT|IV8}}, p. 403</ref>}}\n\nThe '''Red Book of Westmarch''' (sometimes ''Red Book of the [[Hobbits|Perian]]nath'') is the book in which the [[legendarium]] of [[Middle-earth]] was written. It was bound in red leather.\n\n==History==\nThe first Red Book was written as a diary by the [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] [[Bilbo Baggins]] and recounted his quest for [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], which he called ''[[There and Back Again]]''. Preparing to leave for [[Rivendell]] after [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|his farewell party]], he took the empty three red volumes with him.<ref>{{FR|Party}}</ref> Within it, he also compiled [[Elves|Elven]] lore while retired in [[Rivendell]], namely Bilbo's ''[[Translations from the Elvish]]'', legends from the [[Elder Days]], and various Hobbit poems.\n\n[[File:Miriam Ellis - Three Books of Lore.jpg|thumb|left|''Three Books of Lore'' by [[:Category:Images by Miriam Ellis|Miriam Ellis]]]]\nLater, shortly before the end of the [[War of the Ring]], he gave the book to his kinsman and heir [[Frodo Baggins]]. The original first volume was Bilbo's private diary, and attached to it, in a single red case, were the three large volumes bound in red leather: the ''Translations'', which he gave to Frodo as a parting gift. Frodo took the book back to [[the Shire]], organized Bilbo's manuscript and used it to write down his own quest during the [[War of the Ring]]. \n\nThe title page has many titles, several crossed out:\n{| style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none; max-width:25em;\"\n|-\n|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small><s>My Diary.</s> <s>My Unexpected Journey.</s> <s>There and Back Again.

Other material was provided by [[Aragorn|King Elessar]].\n\nAfter Bilbo and Frodo left for [[Valinor]], the Red Book passed into the keeping of [[Samwise Gamgee]], the [[Mayor of Michel Delving|Mayor of the Shire]]. When he also departed for the [[Sea]], he left the book to his eldest daughter, [[Elanor Gardner|Elanor Fairbairn]], and her descendants (the [[Fairbairn Family|Fairbairns]] of the Towers or [[Warden of Westmarch|Wardens of Westmarch]]).<ref>{{app|Later}}</ref> While in the possession of the Fairbairns, a fifth volume was added containing commentaries, genealogical trees, and various other matter concerning the Hobbit members of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]].<ref>{{FR|Records}}</ref><ref>{{app|Gamgee}}</ref>\n\nSeveral copies, with various notes and later additions, were made for the use of Samwise's descendants, and copies were passed on to future generations, of which one, the \"''[[Thain's Book]]''\", is the most important.\n\nThe original version of the Red Book contained the story of Bilbo's journey as it originally stood: thus, Gollum willingly gives [[the One Ring]] to Bilbo, and there is no trace of the Ring's hold over Gollum, something that he never corrected, and persisted in other copies and abstracts, as probably the keepers of the Book were unwilling to make alterations to Bilbo's own text out of respect. But other later copiers of the Book (based on notes by Frodo or Sam) wrote the [[Riddles in the Dark|true account]], in which Bilbo comes across the Ring by accident.<ref>{{FR|Finding}}</ref> \n\nLoose leaves record some poems, possibly from oral tradition, and many jesting nonsensical ones are written carelessly in margins and blank spaces by many hands. In the later [[Ages]] they were unintelligible or half-remembered fragments. Some were attributed to Samwise Gamgee or Bilbo himself, and others displayed contact with Elvish and [[Gondorian]] culture.<ref>{{AB|Foreword}}</ref>\n\nIn the first edition of ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Tolkien's foreword claimed he had translated the Red Book from the original [[Westron]] into English, and that claim is still implied in later editions of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', notably in Appendix F, part II \"On Translation\". It therefore must be supposed that copies of the book survived through the [[Later Ages]]. Tolkien says nothing about how he gained access to one or more copies of the Red Book and how he learned Westron and other languages of [[Arda]].\n\n==Inspiration==\n{{quote|But most of all he [Tolkien] found delight in the Fairy Books of Andrew Lang, especially the '''Red Fairy Book''', for tucked away in its closing pages was the best story he had ever read. This was the tale of Sigurd who slew the dragon Fafnir: a strange and powerful tale set in the nameless North.|''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]'', p. 22}}\n\nTolkien's inspiration for this repository of lore was the real [[Wikipedia:Red Book of Hergest|Red Book of Hergest]], the early 15th century compilation of [[Welsh]] history and poetry that contains the manuscript of the ''[[Mabinogion]]''. Bound (and rebound) in red leather, in the [[Bodleian Library]], Oxford, the manuscript was well known to Tolkien. In the lecture \"[[English and Welsh]]\", published in ''[[The Monsters and the Critics]]'', he called it \"one of the treasures of Medieval Welsh.\" Another possible echo is the [[Wikipedia:Black Book of Carmarthen|Black Book of Carmarthen]].<ref>{{AB|Comm}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayals in adaptations==\n\n'''2001-2003: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''\n:The framing device of the series is that Bilbo serves as a narrator and chronicler of the War of the Ring, writing new chapters and notes into the Red Book of Westmarch during his stay at Rivendell. It is also implied that Frodo eventually compiles his notes and storytelling into the final volume during the years before his and Bilbo's departure from Middle-earth and Frodo's entrusting of the Red Book to Sam.\n\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''\n:In the extended edition, Bilbo is writing in the book (working on the [[Concerning Hobbits|prologue]]) in [[Bag End]].
