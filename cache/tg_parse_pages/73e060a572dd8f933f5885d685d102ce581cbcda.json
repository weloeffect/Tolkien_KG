In his letter on 10 October, Tolkien replies that he is \"''distressed''\" learning about her poor financial situation, but that \"''your ill fortune [in the matter of the illustrations] . . . is mainly due to the present situation in the book world. [[Allen and Unwin]] have found that ‘The Lord of the Rings’ in any form is now so expensive that any attempt to produce it in a special or more sumptuous form is [bound to be] a failure''\". He also writes that he is \"''reluctantly sending back to you the pictures I have received''\", since Fairburn had written that she would give them to a friend as payment for a debt. However, Fairburn had mentioned three other pictures (including portrayals of the [[Old Forest]] and the [[Dead Marshes]]), not seen yet by Tolkien, and he therefore adds: \"''they sound most interesting, especially The Old Forest''\", wanting to take a look at them. In the middle of writing his letter, Tolkien spoke with [[Rayner Unwin]] on the phone, mentioning Fairburn and her pictures. Unwin \"''was not so decisive as I had expected, & was evidently ready to 'consider' an illustrated edition''\". But he adds that pen-and-ink illustrations would be \"''much more likely to prove publishable''\" and that she should not be too hopeful about a swift progress. Finally, he writes that he is sending her £50 in the letter,<ref group=note>As of 2012, worth circa £1,250.</ref> \"''As a gift''\", and he does not want her to mention this in any reply.\n*'''Publication:''' [[The Times Literary Supplement 14 September 2012|''The Times Literary Supplement'' 14 September 2012]].\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Letter to Mary Fairburn (May 1968)]]\n*[[Letter to Mary Fairburn (4 September 1968)]]\n*[[Letter to Mary Fairburn (4 November 1968)]]\n\n{{References|note}}\n{{title}}\n[[Category:Letters|Fairburn, Mary (1968-10-10)]]"}}}
