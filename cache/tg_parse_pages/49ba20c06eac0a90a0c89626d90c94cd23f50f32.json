They were set in the face of a cliff above the river Narog, and could be approached only by a narrow pathway across the cliff{{fact}}, making Nargothrond secure from enemy attack. \n\nAfter Felagund's death, [[Túrin]] came to dwell in Nargothrond, and he persuaded King [[Orodreth]] to change this secretive policy, and to build a [[Bridge of Nargothrond|great bridge]] before the Doors of Felagund, so that his armies could more easily pass across the [[Narog]]. This was a dire error, because it gave [[Morgoth]]'s forces a means to approach the Doors. After the [[Battle of Tumhalad]], [[Glaurung]] the Dragon came against the Doors of Felagund and destroyed them, allowing the [[Orcs]] to sack the once-mighty citadel.<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Doors and gates]]\n\n[[de:Nargothrond#Aufbau]]\n[[fi:Felagundin Ovet]]"}}}
