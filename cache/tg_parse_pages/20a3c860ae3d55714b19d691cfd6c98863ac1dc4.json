Sauron then advanced to Lindon where Gil-galad and a Númenórean force that had already been stationed on the shores of Lindon in preparation for a possible war with Sauron held the River [[Lhûn]] in desperate defence of the [[Grey Havens]]. At the same time a strong detachment of Sauron's forces besieged [[Rivendell]].<ref name=Concerning>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref> Minastir, who loved the Eldar, but envied them,<ref name=Tar-Minastir/> sent a great navy under the command of [[Ciryatur]] to Lindon to aid the Elves in {{SA|1700|n}}.<ref name=\"Tar-Telperien\">{{UT|Kings}}, entry X ''Tar-Telperien''</ref><ref name=Concerning/><ref name=SA1700>{{App|SA}}, entry for the year 1700, p. 1083</ref><ref>{{UT|5a}}, Note 9</ref><ref>{{NM|P3xviii}}, p. 370</ref><ref group=\"note\">In ''The Tale of Years'' it is stated that \"Tar-Minastir\", his name with the prefix ''Tar-'' of the King of Númenor, sent a great navy from Númenor to Lindon in {{SA|1700}} (see ''citation 7''). This event and date are restated in ''The History of Galadriel and Celeborn'', mentioning \"Tar-Minastir the King\" (see ''citation 6''). Yet in ''The Line of Elros'' Tar-Telperiën is said to have lived to {{SA|1731}} and not have given up the sceptre until that time, which would mean she was the ruler of Númenor when the great navy was sent (see ''citation 2''). [[Christopher Tolkien]] could not account for this discrepancy (see ''citation 8''). It is possible to reconcile this discrepancy if Minastir sent the fleet in a capacity, such as [[Regent]] or [[Captain of the King's Ships|Captain of the Queen's Ships]] before he ascended the throne and that later chroniclers simply referred to him as \"Tar-\" or \"the King\" without taking into account that he had not taken the sceptre and had not formally become the king when he sent the fleet to Lindon. In a ''Note on the delay of Gil-galad and the Númenóreans'' it is mentioned that the great host of \"Minastir\" landed in Middle-earth (see ''citation 9'').</ref>\n\nThe delayed navy of Númenór arrived in Lindon<ref name=SA1700/> just in time in {{SA|1700|n}} and Sauron's army was defeated and pushed back to the south-east. A part of the Númenórean ships was ordered by Ciryatur to land at their Great Haven at the mouth of the Gwathló. Subsequently, Sauron's army was defeated again at [[Sarn Ford]] and driven further to the south-east. It was eventually utterly routed in the [[Battle of the Gwathló]] after the Númenórean force that had landed at the Great Haven appeared at its rear and Sauron narrowly escaped with a small remaining force that was further attacked in the east of Calenhardhon back to [[Mordor]]. The strong detachment of Sauron's forces that had been besieging Rivendell was trapped between the forces of Elrond and Gil-galad and completely destroyed.

He was one of only four named kings, along with [[Elros]], Atanamir, and [[Pharazôn]] (the thirteenth and final successor).<ref name=\"Akallabeth\"/>\n\nKiryatan's time is noted as such:\n{{blockquote|In his time first began the division of the folk between the [[King's Men|King’s folk]] and the ''[[Nimruzîrim]]'' (''Elendilli'') or Elf-friends.

This king was ''Tar-Kiryatan'' (Shipwright) or in Númenórean ''Ar-Balkumagān''. Settlements of ''dominion'' in Middle-earth begin.|{{PM|Akallabeth}}, p. 186}}\n\nIt was under the reign of Atanamir that the Shadow first fell on Númenor, and the Númenóreans began to desire for everlasting life. Tar-Kiryatan, in a role which would later be taken by [[Tar-Ancalimon]], was Atanamir's son of like mind who's time led to division among the Númenóreans, building of great tombs for the dead, and, after his days, of neglecting the first fruits to [[Eru]].<ref name=\"Akallabeth\"/>\n\n===Other===\n''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'' incorrectly states the year of his death as {{SA|2251}}. This is because the ''[[Appendix B|Tale of Years]]'' said that in that year \"Tar-Atanamir takes the sceptre\". However, Atanamir died in 2221. 2221 is itself an emendation of 2251, and the former (2221) appears in the later tables, while the latter (2251) in the earlier tables: therefore 2251 (properly 2221) should have read \"Death of Tar-Atanamir.
