This scene was extended in the latter edition.\n\n==Synopsis==\nAfter defeating [[Lurtz]], a bloody [[Aragorn]] rushes to the wounded [[Boromir]] who is lying on the ground. \n\nBoromir tells Aragorn that [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] have been taken by the [[Uruk-hai]] and asks about [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]. Aragorn glances at him while trying to heal his wounds and tells him he let Frodo go. Boromir admits to Aragorn that he tried to take the [[The One Ring|Ring]] from Frodo. and feels he has failed the [[Fellowship]]. However, Aragorn tells him he fought bravely. \n\nBoromir is certain that [[Sauron]] will take control of [[Middle-earth]], and that [[Minas Tirith]] will fall. But Aragorn swears to him ''\"I will not let the [[Minas Tirith|White City]] fall, nor our people fail\"''. A dying Boromir fixates on Aragorn's acknowledgement of his ties to [[Gondor]] and the race of [[Men]], and reaches for his sword. Aragorn places it in his hands as [[Legolas]] and [[Gimli]] arrive in Boromir's final moments. \n\n''\"I would have followed you my brother. My captain. My king,\"'' Boromir says to Aragorn with a smile and a touch of reverence, before he passes away. \n\n==Differences==\nWhile this scene occurs towards the end of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', in the books, the corresponding events occur in the first chapter of ''[[The Two Towers]]''. \n\nIn terms of differences in content, in this scene, Boromir is found pierced by three arrows by Lurtz – a character created for the movie – whereas in the books, Boromir is pierced by many arrows shot by [[Orcs]]; he was found by Aragorn leaning against a tree with the bodies of many Orcs around him.<ref name=\"TT Departure\">{{TT|Departure}}, p. 414</ref> Aragorn's vulnerability is much more evident in the book; following the death of Boromir, Aragorn states ''\"Vain was [[Gandalf]]'s trust in me\"'', and ''\"All that I have done today has gone amiss\"''.<ref name=\"TT Departure\" /> In this scene, he is much more accepting of Boromir's death and (in the [[The Road Goes Ever On... (scene)|next scene]]) the wider events that have befallen the [[Fellowship]].\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring scenes|45]]"}}}
