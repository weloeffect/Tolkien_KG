Fearing the establishment of the powerful kingdoms in exile &mdash; [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]] &mdash; by his hated enemies, the [[Dúnedain]], Sauron launched a pre-emptive attack on Gondor in {{SA|3429}}.\n\n[[Isildur]] left [[Minas Ithil]] for the north to meet his father and [[High King of the Dúnedain]] [[Elendil]], whilst [[Anárion]], Elendil's younger son, defended [[Osgiliath]] against the hosts of [[Mordor]].<ref name=SA/>\n\nIn response, Elendil formed an alliance with [[Gil-galad]], the [[High King of the Noldor]], to repel Sauron's assault in {{SA|3430}}.<ref name=SA/> [[Durin's Folk]] also joined. It is said that Elendil bound the Alliance with an oath and invoked the name of [[Eru]] to witness it.<ref name=Cirion>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref> Eru's name was very rarely invoked in oaths, and among the [[Númenóreans]] it was held that only the King could call upon Him. This would happen again only thousands of years later during the [[Oath of Cirion]].<ref name=Cirion/> \n\nIt is said that the hosts of Gil-galad joined Elendil at [[Weathertop|Amon Sûl]]<ref name=Knife>{{FR|Knife}}</ref> and marched towards Imladris in {{SA|3431}} where they camped for three years,<ref name=SA/> forging armour and making plans.{{fact}}\n[[File:Angel Falto - Elf Last Alliance.jpg|200px|thumb|left|''Last Alliance'' by [[:Category:Images by Angel Falto|Angel Falto]]]]\nFinally in {{SA|3434}} the armies crossed the [[Misty Mountains]] at various locations; Gil-galad and [[Isildur]] crossed the [[Pass of Imladris]] and the [[Pass of Caradhras]], and their hosts were so large that the [[Orcs of Mordor]] sent by Sauron to harry them hid themselves instead.<ref>{{UT|Gladden}}</ref> Their forces were strengthened in the [[Vales of Anduin]] by Elves from [[Lothlórien]] and [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]] under the command of [[Oropher]] and [[Amdír]] and by the Dwarves of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]].\n\nWhen Sauron learned of their advance, he burned the former [[Brown Lands|Gardens]] of the [[Entwives]] to hinder them down the [[Anduin]].<ref>{{L|144}}</ref>\n\nSoon they reached [[Dagorlad]] where they met and defeated Sauron's army in the [[Battle of Dagorlad]] after months of fierce fighting. Sauron retreated, and the Alliance breached the [[Morannon]] into [[Mordor]], marching to besiege the Dark Lord's fortress of [[Barad-dûr]]. The siege lasted for seven years, during which the Alliance sustained heavy losses; among others, [[Anárion]] was slain. It culminated in Sauron leaving his fortress and breaking the siege himself. Sauron's last sortie pushed the army of the Alliance back to the slopes of [[Orodruin]].<ref name=SA/> \n\nAt the last stage of the [[Siege of Barad-dûr]], Sauron slew Gil-galad and Elendil in single combat, but was himself defeated.<ref name=SA/> Isildur cut the Ring from Sauron's finger.<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref> Sauron's body died and his spirit fled. Without the power of the One Ring, Sauron could not take form again in Middle-earth for a thousand years.\n\nWith the victory over Sauron and the death of Gil-galad and Elendil, the Last Alliance was dissolved. The remaining Númenóreans resettled their [[Realms in Exile|kingdoms]].\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Armies]]\n\n==See also==\n* '''[[War of the Last Alliance]]''' (Military information)\n*[[Union of Maedhros]], a similar alliance of the [[First Age]]\n\n[[Category:Gondorians]]\n[[Category:Elves]]\n[[de:Letztes Bündnis]]\n[[fr:encyclo:evenements:2a:derniere alliance des elfes et des hommes]]\n[[fi:Haltioiden ja Ihmisten Viimeinen Liitto]]"}}}
