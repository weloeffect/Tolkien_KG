He is portrayed by [[Ian Hughes]].\n\n==History==\nIrolas greeted [[Faramir]] and his troops at the gate of [[Minas Tirith]] after they had abandoned [[Osgiliath]] following an [[Orcs|Orc]] attack. He praised the wisdom of [[Denethor|Denethor II]], claiming he had foreseen it. [[Gandalf]] rebutted \"Foreseen and done nothing\".\n\nAfter Faramir returned after his assault on Osgiliath, Irolas hurried his gravely injured body through Minas Tirith. He was brought to the court and Denethor emerged, asking whether Faramir had fallen. Irolas told him that they were outnumbered and that none had survived.\n\nDumbfounded, Irolas witnessed the total breakdown of Denethor as he ordered everyone to abandon their posts.\n\n==Inspiration ==\nIn the commentary of {{rotkee}}, it is stated that he was originally to be called [[Beregond]], but as the role was reduced, [[Peter Jackson]] saw little use in still calling him Beregond.{{fact}} On a [[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game|Decipher Card]], Irolas is identified as [[Imrahil]] instead.<ref>{{LOTRTCGW|Imrahil, Prince of Dol Amroth (8R37)|16 August 2025}}</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Men from adaptations]] \n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings (film series) characters]]\n\n[[de:Irolas]]"}}}
