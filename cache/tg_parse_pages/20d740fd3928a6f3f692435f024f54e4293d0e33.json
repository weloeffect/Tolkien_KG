The book considers Tolkien's creative writing as an ever-developing 'legendarium': an interconnected web of stories, poems and essays, from his early poems in the 1910s to his latest writings in the early 1970s. Consequently, the book is not restricted to a discussion of Tolkien's best-known works only ('The Hobbit', 'The Lord of the Rings' and 'The Silmarillion') but examines the whole corpus of his legendarium, including the 12-volume History of Middle-earth series, which has received little attention from critics. This new approach and scope brings to light neglected aspects of Tolkien's imaginative vision and addresses key features of Tolkien's creativity: the centrality of the Elves and the role of linguistic invention in his legendarium, as well as race and material culture in Middle-earth.}}\n\n==Contents==\n*List of Figures\n*Acknowledgements\n*Conventions and Abbreviations\n#Introduction\n#*His 'private and beloved nonsense': ''The Silmarillion'' and the 'Silmarillion'\n#*A Victorian beginning and a modern end\n#*'I hold the key': constructing a 'biographical legend'\n\n===Part I.
