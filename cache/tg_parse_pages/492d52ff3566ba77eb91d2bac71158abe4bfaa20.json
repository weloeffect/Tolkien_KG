These Stoors remained here until the [[Great Plague]] nearly wiped them out, and the remainder then went to the [[Southfarthing]] of [[the Shire]].\n\nAt the east end of the Swanfleet was a waterfall, beyond which was a ford over the Glanduin,<ref>{{RK|VI6}}</ref> from where led a road to the ruins of [[Ost-in-Edhil]], the ruined city of [[Eregion]].<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Nîn-in-Eilph'' is [[Sindarin]] for \"water-lands of the Swans\".<ref>{{VT|42a}}, p. 7</ref>\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn the first printings of ''[[A Map of Middle-earth]]'', [[Pauline Baynes]] wrongly labels \"R[iver] Swanfleet\" as the lower part of the R.

This includes \"Western [[Eregion]]\" and the lands about the [[Old South Road]] on the edge of [[Enedwaith]]. Several villages of [[Men]] and [[Stoors|Stoor]] [[Hobbits]] can be found here, as can the ruins of \"[[Ost-in-Edhil|Caras Gelebren]]\", capital of Eregion.\n\n:Swanfleet is presented as an optional starting location available to new characters of all races, as opposed to the default starting regions of [[Bree-land]], [[Blue Mountains|Ered Luin]], and [[the Shire]], to which new characters are sent depending on their race.\n{{references}}\n\n[[fr:encyclo/redaction/agmar/geographie/eaux/eregion/marais_aux_cygnes]]\n\n[[Category:Eriador]]\n[[Category:Regions]]\n[[Category:Swamps]]"}}}
