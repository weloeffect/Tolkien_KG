Between late [[1954]] and early [[1955]], writing additional material, such as ''[[The Quest of Erebor]]'' and ''[[The Hunt for the Ring]]'', but most of it had to be omitted because of space.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. xxxii, xxxiv</ref>\n==Omissions and translations==\nWhile compiling [[The Lord of the Rings Index|the Index]], Tolkien advised that the names of the Appendices should not be included. Also he considered that a fuller index (See: [[Unfinished index]]) should replace parts of the Appendices, but this never happened.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. lxxxii</ref>\n\nIn [[1968]] [[Allen and Unwin]] published a one volume paperback edition, including only Appendix A I v, 'The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen'. Apparently this was done because a paperback thick enough to include all Appendices could not be produced economically. Tolkien agreed, but he made a special plea to include ''[[The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen]]''.<ref>{{CG|CG}}, vol. I,  p. 720</ref> This is the only edition in English (several print runs of which were issued hardbound as book club editions) known not to include the complete Appendices. But it seems to have given numerous publishers of translations the idea or excuse to likewise include only 'The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen'.\n\nMany translations lack the Appendices or only include a selection of them. In a number of cases the Appendices were, wholly or partly, published as a separate volume. It has even happened that those Appendices that were not or only partly included in the official translation were published in a fan publication.<ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond]], [[Douglas A.

As soon as the prospect of translations began to be discussed, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] stated that he was willing to allow \"reduction or omission in parts\" of the Appendices (whereas he would “not tolerate the abridgement or re-arrangement\" of the narrative). \"Only Appendix A v, [''[[The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen]]''] ... is really essential to the story.”<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''Letter of [[6 April|April 6]], [[1956]]'', quoted in {{CG|CG}}, vol. I, p. 488</ref> When objecting to translation of names into Dutch he proposed \"to substitute for some of the least-wanted Appendices a glossary of names\".<ref>{{L|190}}, also quoted in {{CG|CG}}, vol. I p. 493</ref> He subsequently wrote to the [[Max Schuchart|Dutch translator]], suggesting which part of the appendices might be omitted from the Dutch translation, apparently these included F II and D except for the section on the [[Shire Calendar]].<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''Letter of [[29 March|March 29]], [[1957]]'', quoted in {{CG|CG}}, vol. I p. 504 and vol. II p. 1035</ref> Later he suggested dropping \"Appendix D (other than the Shire Calendar); probably most of App. E II, and most of F II\" in general.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''Letter of [[29 May|May 29]], [[1958]]'', quoted in {{CG|CG}}, vol. I p. 527 and vol. II p. 1035</ref>\n\nWhen the Swedish publishers proposed to omit the Appendices altogether, Tolkien replied \"I have no objection (...) to the omission of C, D (except for the Shire Calendar ...), E ii and F ii. Omission of the remainder would be, in differing degrees, damaging to the book as a whole. In the case of Het Spectrum [the Dutch translation], A and B and the Shire Calendar were retained, and that is the arrangement that I favour. I feel strongly that the minimum is retention of A (v) 'Of Aragorn and Arwen', and the Shire Calendar ...\";<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''Letter of [[24 January|January 24]], [[1961]]'', quoted in {{CG|CG}}, vol. I p. 568 and vol. II p. 1035</ref> in this reply he also agreed the Appendices could be published in a separate volume. As a result, the Swedish translation contained only ‘The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen’ and Appendix D. Subsequently, however, all Appendices except parts of E II and F II were published as a separate volume. Likewise, the Dutch translation of all Appendices except F II has been included in some later editions in one or three volumes, and also published as a separate volume. In one edition F II was also included. But the example set in the first instance by the publishers of the first two translations was followed in several other languages.\n\n{{References}}\n{{appendices}}{{lotr}}\n{{title|journal}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Appendices}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings chapters]]\n[[de:Der Herr der Ringe: Anhänge und Register]]\n[[fi:Liitteet (TSH)]]"}}}
