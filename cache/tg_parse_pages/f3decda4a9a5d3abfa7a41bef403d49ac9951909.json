He has illustrated numerous [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] books and calendars. Together with [[John Howe]], Lee was a concept artist for both [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'']] and [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]].\n==History==\nAlan Lee was born in London, and attended the [[Wikipedia:Ealing|Ealing]] School of Art.<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0496769/bio IMDb biography]</ref> At the advice of a friend, he read ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' when he was 17, and it greatly influenced his professional work. He had at that time never heard of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] or ''[[The Hobbit]]''.<ref>[http://einsiders.com/features/interviews/alanlee.php Interview], EInsiders.com.</ref> He moved to Dartmoor and married Marja Kruÿt. They have one daughter together, Virginia.<ref>[http://www.visionary-artist.co.uk/index.html Biography] of Marja Lee Kruÿt.</ref><ref>[http://www.herenistarion.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=37&Itemid=33 Interview], [[North East Tolkien Society|HerenIstarion.org]].</ref>\n\nAlan has suffered many deaths in his lifetime, including his father's when he was only 13 years of age.\n\nIn his paintings, Lee uses watercolour. He describes his style as a combination of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(visual_arts) Realistic] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism Romantic].<ref>\"Designing Middle-earth\", [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]], Extended Edition.</ref>\n\nThrough the publishers, Lee has communicated with [[Christopher Tolkien]] in an effort to ensure he is happy with his illustrations. Lee sent through drafts and had discussions with him about what subjects he did and did not wish to see depicted by Lee. For ''[[Beren and Lúthien]]'', Christopher asked Lee to refrain from depicting [[Morgoth]], as he believed a figure as powerful as the first Dark Lord is better left described or hinted towards in the text.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qabSVGRBkB8 Interview d'Alan Lee à l'occasion de la sortie française de Beren et Lúthien de J.R.R.

Jackson was greatly inspired by Lee, and wanted him to be part of the crew. Lee watched the movies, and phoned back 3,5 hours later to say yes.<ref name=\"Lord of the Drawings\">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2006/01/23/alan_lee_feature.shtml \"Lord of the Drawings\"], BBC Interview.</ref> Three weeks later he flew to New Zealand, where he and [[John Howe]] joined the [[Weta Workshop]]. He would live in New Zealand for six years, before returning to Dartmoor.<ref name=\"designing\">\"Designing Middle-earth\", [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]], Extended Edition.</ref> His daughter Virginia also worked on the movie; one of her contributions was woodwork for the throne of [[Théoden]].<ref name=\"designing\"/>\n\nLee has two cameos in ''The Lord of the Rings'' movies by Peter Jackson: he appears as the second from the right of the nine [[Nazgûl|Kings of Men]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', along with John Howe, and as a man of [[Rohan]] at the armoury of the [[Hornburg]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'', along with [[Dan Hennah]].\n\nLee expressed interest in working on ''The Hobbit'', and stated that \"It would have to be a pretty special film to match the experience of working on The Lord of the Rings\".<ref name=\"Lord of the Drawings\"/> Lee was involved on work on [[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]], once again along with John Howe. \n\nLee has one cameo too in ''The Hobbit'' movies by Peter Jackson: he appears as a man-musician of [[Lake-town|Laketown]] in ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|The Desolation of Smaug]]'', along with John Howe.\n\nLee and Howe together drew the artwork of the cast at the end of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]''. For ''The Battle of the Five Armies'', the sketching of the cast was split by nationality; John Howe drew [[Tauriel]] / [[Evangeline Lilly]], as they are both Canadian.{{fact}}\n\n==Published artwork==\n* [[1984]]: ''Castles'' (text by [[David Day]])\n* [[1991]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''\n* [[1992]]: ''[[Tolkien's World: Paintings of Middle-earth]]''\n* [[1992]]: ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''\n* [[1992]]: ''[[The Two Towers]]''\n* [[1992]]: ''[[The Return of the King]]''\n* [[1993]]: ''[[The 1993 J.R.R.
