Tolkien]]. It was written [[27 April|27]]-[[28 April]] [[1915]],<ref name=\"TAH\">{{HM|AH}}, \"[[Over Hill and Under Hill]]\", pp. 111-112, n. 10</ref> at about the same time as [[The Little House of Lost Play: Mar Vanwa Tyaliéva|You and Me / and the Cottage of Lost Play]].<ref name=\"LT1\">{{LT1|I}}, p. 32</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\n\"Goblin Feet\" was first published in [[Oxford Poetry 1915|''Oxford Poetry'' 1915]]. It was later reprinted in ''[[The Book of Fairy Poetry]]'' ([[1920]]), a publication notable for being the first instance of published artwork (by Warwick Goble) based on Tolkien's writing.<ref name=\"LT1\"/> The poem has since been published in ''[[Fifty New Poems for Children]]'' (?[[1922]]), ''[[Wonder Tales from Fairy Isles]]'' ([[1929]]), ''[[The Open Door to Poetry]]'' ([[1931]]), ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]'' ([[1977]]), [[Mallorn 23|''Mallorn'' 23]] ([[1986]]), and ''[[The Annotated Hobbit]]: Revised and Expanded Edition'' ([[2002]]).\n\n==Tolkien's later thoughts==\n[[File:Fifty New Poems for Children - Goblin Feet.jpg|\"Goblin Feet\" in ''[[Fifty New Poems for Children]]'', erroneously attributed to [[Tolkein|J.R.R. Tolkein]]|thumb|right]]\nIn ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]'', [[Christopher Tolkien]] notes that in [[1971]] his father said: \"''I wish the unhappy little thing, representing all that I came (so soon after) to fervently dislike, could be buried for ever.''\"<ref name=\"LT1\"/>\n\n[[Douglas A. Anderson]] argues that Tolkien's use of 'so soon after' suggests that his dislike of \"Goblin Feet\" and its whimsical elements probably dates from the mid- to late 1930s.<ref name=\"TAH\"/>\n\n==Poem==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nI am off down the road\nWhere the fairy lanterns glowed\nAnd the little pretty flitter-mice are flying\nA slender band of gray\nIt runs creepily away\nAnd the hedges and the grasses are a-sighing.\nThe air is full of wings,\nAnd of blundery beetle-things\nThat warn you with their whirring and their humming.\nO! I hear the tiny horns\nOf enchanted leprechauns\nAnd the padded feet of many gnomes a-coming!\n\nO! the lights! O! the gleams! O! the little twinkly sounds!\nO! the rustle of their noiseless little robes!\nO! the echo of their feet - of their happy little feet!\nO! the swinging lamps in the starlit globes.\n\nI must follow in their train\nDown the crooked fairy lane\nWhere the coney-rabbits long ago have gone.\nAnd where silvery they sing\nIn a moving moonlit ring\nAll a twinkle with the jewels they have on.\nThey are fading round the turn\nWhere the glow worms palely burn\nAnd the echo of their padding feet is dying!\nO! it's knocking at my heart-\nLet me go! O! let me start!\nFor the little magic hours are all a-flying.\n\nO! the warmth! O! the hum! O! the colours in the dark!\nO! the gauzy wings of golden honey-flies!\nO! the music of their feet - of their dancing goblin feet!\nO! the magic! O! the sorrow when it dies.</poem>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Index:Poems by J.R.R. Tolkien|Poems by J.R.R.
