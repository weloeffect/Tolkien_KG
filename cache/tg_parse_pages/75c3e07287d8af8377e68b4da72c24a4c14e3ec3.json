After Morgoth was overthrown, their gardens blossomed and they taught [[Men]] agriculture who honoured them.<ref name=treebeard/> \n\nBut a time came in the [[Second Age]] when these immense forests were cut by the [[Númenóreans]]<ref>{{UT|Aldarion}}</ref> or destroyed in the calamitous [[War of the Elves and Sauron]] during the 17th century of that Age. The shrinking of the forest solidified their separation from the Entwives. The Fangorn Forest was just the Eastern End of that immense forest, and one of its small remnants. The gardens of the Entwives were destroyed by [[Sauron]], and they disappeared. The Ents looked for them in vain and it is sung by the Ents that one day they will find each other but there is very scarce hope that they survived.<ref name=\"L|144\">{{L|144}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Third Age]], the [[Fangorn Forest]] was apparently the only place Ents still inhabited, although the Ent-like [[Huorns]] may still have survived elsewhere, as in the [[Old Forest]].

Some grew 'treeish' and ceased moving or speaking.<ref name=guide/> \n\n[[Halfast Gamgee]] reportedly encountered a \"Tree-man\" near [[the Shire]].<ref>{{FR|Shadow}}</ref> However, it was never learned whether the \"Tree-Man\" was an Ent, an Entwife, or just a story.\n\n=== Last March ===\n[[File:John Howe - The Ents Destroy Isengard.jpg|thumb|''The Ents Destroy Isengard'' by [[John Howe]]]]\n{{quote|The Ents are going to war!|[[Treebeard]]}}\nAbout {{TA|2950}},{{fact}}[[Saruman]]'s armies began harassing the few remaining Ents and cutting down large numbers of their trees. During the [[War of the Ring]] the Ents&mdash;usually a very patient, deliberate people&mdash;were spurred by [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and [[Peregrin Took]]. They convened an ''[[Entmoot]]'', a meeting of the Ents at [[Derndingle]].<ref name=treebeard/>\n\nAfter lengthy deliberation (though from the perspective of the Ents, this was very quick action), they marched on Saruman's fortress at [[Isengard]]: the last march of the Ents.  They were led by Treebeard, the oldest Ent, and accompanied by the [[Hobbits]] Merry and Pippin. They [[Battle of Isengard|destroyed Isengard]] in an all-out assault and trapped Saruman in the tower of [[Orthanc]]. They flooded [[Nan Curunír]] and transformed it into a forested area which they called [[Treegarth of Orthanc]].<ref>{{TT|Voice}}</ref>\n\nNot only that, but a few days later, they defended [[Rohan]] when [[Eastemnet]] was invaded by hostile forces.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the reunification of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]], Treegarth became a part of the [[Reunited Kingdom]] and [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] declared it an Entish realm, granting the Ents complete self-governance.<ref name=partings>{{RK|Partings}}</ref>\n\nThe Ents remained in Fangorn where they probably dwindled in the following [[Ages]],<ref name=guide/> but [[Galadriel]] wished to Treebeard that they would meet again in Tasarinan, when Beleriand is lifted again from the waves, in [[Arda Healed|Spring]].<ref name=partings/>\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Tree Shepherds.jpg|right|thumb|''The Tree Shepherds'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nEnts were 14-foot tall creatures like humanoid trees with very thick skin resembling tree bark. They resembled the trees that they shepherded. An individual Ent more or less resembled the specific species of tree that they typically guarded or honoured, to the point of the personality one might expect from that tree.<ref name=guide/> Thus they varied in height and size, colouring, and in number of fingers and toes. For example, [[Quickbeam]] guarded [[Rowans|rowan]] trees and thus looked very much like a rowan.\n\nThere were trees that were awake or half-awake, and some were ''entish'' and Ents could awake or talk with some of them. Treebeard aroused some [[Huorns]] to destroy Isengard.<ref>{{TT|Flotsam}}</ref>\n\nEnts were dwelling in [[Ent-houses]] and were nourished by [[Ent-draughts]]. They were [[immortality|immortal]] (although they could be damaged or killed with sufficient force) and along with it, they were deliberate and slow in thought, decision and action. Their slow, long-winded language reflected this; of other languages they preferred [[Quenya]], which they also spoke in an agglutinating, long-winded way like Entish.\n\nHowever, once aroused, they possessed great strength, which resembled the age-long action of trees accelerated, crushing rocks and moving earth in seconds.<ref name=guide/> Though susceptible to pain, their thick skin made them very difficult to harm with metal weapons<ref>{{TT|Flotsam}}, p. 567</ref> (they are much more vulnerable to fire). Treebeard boasted that they were much more powerful than [[Trolls]], which [[Morgoth]] supposedly made as imitations of the Ents (he compares this with how [[Orcs]] were an imitation of [[Elves]]).<ref name=tt486>{{TT|Treebeard}}, p. 486</ref>\n\nThe length of an ent-stride was about 4 feet.

Tolkien]], \"[[Letter to L.M. Cutts]]\" (letter), ''[[Sotheby's English Literature, History, Fine Bindings, Private Press Books, Children's Books, Illustrated Books and Drawings 10 July 2003]]''</ref> In [[Letter 163|a letter]] to [[W.H.

In the movie adaptation, the Ents at the Entmoot decide that this is \"not our war\", despite strong protest from Merry.  The scene is also shorter, cutting out [[Bregalad]] completely; Treebeard is the only Ent who is named and speaks on screen.\n\n:Treebeard is about to take them north to the border, when Pippin insists that they go South instead, because \"''the closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm''\". This \"does not make sense\" to Treebeard, but he does as they ask, and sees the ruin and destruction that Saruman has wrought on southern Fangorn.  Treebeard then calls the Ents to battle with his booming Ent-call, and they appear out of the forest as if they had been standing there waiting for it. That they do not know the borders of their own forest is another possible logical gap. But others have accepted Jackson's technique as valid, because of the seemingly minor actions of Merry and Pippin throughout The Two Towers.\n\n'''2003: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' (video game)]]:'''\n:Multiple Ents make appearances during the Fangorn Forest mission, destroying Saruman's Uruks fleeing from [[Helm's Deep]], although as non-playable characters.\n\n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring|Sierra's War of the Ring]]'':'''\n:A Summoned Ent is the strongest magic power available to the Free Peoples; an Ent's strength is equal only to the [[Balrogs|Balrog]] on the Evil site.\n\n'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'':'''\n:In the storyline missions, Ents are assisting Merry and Pippin in the escape from the Uruks as well as destroying Isengard concurrent with the Battle of Helm's Deep.
