Like all the animals on the isle, they were friendly to [[Men]]. Though they did not like to be disturbed, living far from humans within mountainous or rocky areas, with the great black bears being mostly found within the [[Forostar]]. Yet they often came to visit houses and were given honey. While sometimes on rare occurrences, a [[Númenoreans|Númenorean]] may be killed by bears or a ''\"bad bear\"'' would occasionally raid domesticated beehives, neither race considered these reasons to make war on the other. The strangest occurrence between the relations of Men and bears were the ''\"bear-dances\"'', which were curious dances put on by the bears, often black bears, for the delight and entertainment of Men, by whose instruction these bear-dances may have been improved upon. The most famous of the bear-dances was the [[Great Bear-dance]] of [[Tompollë]], performed annually in the [[Forostar]] during autumn.<ref>{{NM|P3xiii}}, pp. 333, 334, 335</ref>\n\nGreat and ancient bears had lived within the [[Misty Mountains]] for some time. Though by the late [[Third Age]], their number had diminished. [[Gandalf]] told [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] that [[Giants]] had taken up their homes in that mountain range. According to Gandalf, some believe that [[Beorn]], a skin changer, was a black bear that was descended from them.<ref>{{H|7}}</ref>\n\n== Other names ==\nThe [[Sindarin]] word for \"bear\" was ''graw''.<ref>{{VT|47a}}, p. 12, note 3</ref> Early [[Noldorin]] had two words for ''bear'': ''brôg'' and ''megli'', with the variation ''meglivorn'' (\"Black bear\").<ref name=\"morok\">{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries \"[[MOROK]]\", [[LIS]]-</ref> \n\nThe [[Quenya]] word is given as '''''morco''''', sharing a [[Sundocarmë|Root]] with ''brôg''.<ref name=\"morok\"/> In [[Common Eldarin]] is given as ''morokō''<ref name=\"morok\"/> and ''mor(o)kē'' (\"she-bear\").<ref>{{PE|21}}, p. 82</ref>\n\n[[Adûnaic]] also had its own terms, specifically ''urug'' in \"common\" gender singular (\"bear\", as a species/creature), the masculine singular ''urgû'' (\"male bear\") and the feminine singular ''urgî'' (\"female bear\", \"she-bear\").<ref>{{SD|3}}, pp. 426, 435</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nIn the earliest outlines of ''[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]'', [[Tuor]] was clad in the skins of bears.<ref name=\"Fall\">{{LT2|III}}</ref> The sinews of bears were also used to make bowstring<ref>{{HM|LB}}, \"[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]\", line 1073 (page 47)</ref> and harp strings.<ref name=\"Fall\"/>\n\n== Other writings ==\n===''Mr. Bliss''===\n''[[Mr. Bliss]]'' includes three mischievous bears [[Archie]], [[Teddy]] and [[Bruno]], who more resemble teddybears in Tolkien's drawings.<ref>[[J.R.R.
