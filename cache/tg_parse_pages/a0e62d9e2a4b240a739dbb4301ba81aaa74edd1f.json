Only queen [[Meril-i-Turinqi|Meril]] could give it. Drinking it was dangerous for a [[mortal]] [[Man]], as [[Ilúvatar]] made his [[Children of Ilúvatar|Children]] different, and drinking ''limpë'' would erase his old desires but awake new ones. Sometimes, after teaching and examination of the heart, it was given to children from the [[Cottage of Lost Play]], but giving it to an adult was different and the person would suffer. It gave youth, but the man had to die anyway.<ref name=lt1iv>{{LT1|IV}}</ref>\n\nBecause [[Gnomes|Noldoli]] had not had it yet during their flight from [[Valinor]], the evil soon ensnared them.<ref>{{LT1|VII}}</ref> ''Limpë'' was given to elves by [[Tulkas]] during their great expedition to save enslaved [[Gnomes]].<ref name=lt2vi>{{LT2|VI}}</ref>\n\n''Limpë'' (maybe given by [[Eärendel]]) made a [[man]] named [[Ingwë]], king of [[Luthany]], immortal.<ref name=lt2vi/>\n\n=== In the story of Eriol ===\n[[Eriol]] learnt about ''limpë'' from [[Vairë (wife of Lindo)|Vairë]]. When he went for it to Meril-i-Turinqi, she refused to give him it immediately, as first he had to learn more. She told him about the [[chaining of Melkor|chaining of Melko]]<ref name=lt1iv/> and the coming of the elves.<ref>{{LT1|V}}</ref> Later [[Lindo]] explained that Eriol had to visit [[Gilfanon]] in his [[House of the Hundred Chimneys]].<ref>{{LT1|VIII}}</ref> As the last condition, Gilfanon bid Eriol to write down all the tales that he had heard in [[Tol Eressëa]]. Then Eriol drank ''limpë''. He was forever young and married [[Naimi]], an elf, but finally he died in [[Tavrobel]], homesick.<ref name=lt2vi/>\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Limpë'' is an early [[Quenya]] name meaning \"wine, drink of the [[Valar]]\"<ref name=eldamo>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3850452647.html|articlename=ᴹQ. limpe n.|dated=|website=Eldamo|accessed=}}</ref>, being derived from the [[Sundocarmë|root]] [[LIP]] (\"wine\").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry \"LIP-\"</ref>\n\nIn [[Qenya]], the name ''limpë'' variously meant \"fairy-drink\"<ref name=eldamo/>, \"elfwine\"<ref name=eldamo/>, and \"drink of the [[fairies]]\"<ref name=eldamo/>.<ref name=appendix>{{LT1|Appendix}}, p. 258 (entry \"Limpë\")</ref> It came from the root LIPI, related with \"drip, drop\".
