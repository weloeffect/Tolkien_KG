There it grew to an incredible height, even reaching [[Ilwë]] (the part of air in which the stars are located<ref>{{LT1|III}}, p. 65</ref>).<ref name=\"Pine\"/>\n\nWhen [[Melko]] broke free of his second imprisonment, he went to Tol Eressëa in order to sow dissension between the Gnomes and the [[Solosimpi]], who sent for help to [[Valinor]]. However, the only aid that came from the [[Valar]] was that of [[Tulkas]] who in secret has sent his son [[Telimektar]] to Tol Eressëa to aid them.<ref name=\"Pine\"/>\n\nThere, Telimektar, with the help of [[Ingil]]<ref group=\"note\">In ''[[The Cottage of Lost Play]]'', it is said that Ingil eventually returned to Valinor, which seems to represent a different, distinct idea from the one mentioned above.</ref><ref>{{LT2|VI}}, p. 282</ref> son of [[Inwë]], surprised Melko and wounded him, and chased him up the Pine of Tavrobel all the way to Ilwë.
