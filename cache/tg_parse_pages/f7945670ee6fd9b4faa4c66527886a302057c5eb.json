It was the area around [[Lake Mithrim]], surrounded by the [[Ered Wethrin]], and the '''[[Mountains of Mithrim]]''', which separated Mithrim from [[Dor-lómin]] to the west.<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref> Mithrim's climate was the same as Hithlum's; the air was cool and the winter was cold but it was a fair land.<ref name=\"Beleriand\">{{S|Beleriand}}</ref> Swans were frequently seen in the pools of the land.<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>\n\nMithrim was first inhabited by the [[Elves of Mithrim|Grey-elves of Mithrim]],<ref name=\"Return\">{{S|Return}}</ref> and then also by [[Noldor]] of [[Fingolfin]] and [[Fingon]].<ref name=\"Gondolin\">{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>\n\nMithrim contained deposits of silver, copper, and tin.<ref name=\"nature\">{{NM|P3v}}, pg. 272</ref>\n\n==History==\nSome time before the rising of the [[Moon]], [[Sindar|Sindarin Elves]] from Beleriand came over [[Ered Wethrin]] and settled in Mithrim.<ref name=\"Return\"/>\n\nWhen the [[Noldor]] returned to Middle-earth the host of [[Fëanor]] camped upon the northern shore of [[Lake Mithrim]].<ref name=\"Return\"/> While here, Fëanor explored the ground and discovered its metals.<ref name=\"nature\" />\n\n[[Morgoth]] sent a host of [[Orcs]] through the [[Ered Wethrin]] to attack the newcomers and thus upper Mithrim was the scene of the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]].<ref name=\"Return\"/> Fëanor was killed shortly after when he led an overextended force that was ambushed; the metals in Mithrim contributed greatly to his rashness by trying too soon to conquer the region.<ref name=\"nature\" />\n\nThe Noldor met the [[Elves of Mithrim]] and learned from them of King [[Thingol]], and tidings of what had transpired during their stay in [[Valinor]].<ref name=\"Return\"/>\n\nAt the rising of the [[Sun]] the host of [[Fingolfin]] marched into Mithrim. After approaching [[Angband]] Fingolfin's host returned to Mithrim and camped upon the northern shore of Lake Mithrim. Due to the rift between Fingolfin's people and the followers of Fëanor, the latter relocated to the southern shores of the lake.<ref name=\"Return\"/>\n\nAt a [[council in Mithrim]] the princes of the Noldor gathered and, among other things, selected Fingolfin as [[High King of the Noldor|High King]].\n\nLater in the [[First Age]] Mithrim was ruled by Fingolfin, as it formed the most densely populated part of Hithlum.<ref name=Beleriand/> However, after the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] Morgoth overran Mithrim and all of Hithlum and afterwards turned the land over to the [[Swarthy Men]].<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>\n\nIn the winter of the year of the Nirnaeth [[Rían]] gave birth to [[Tuor]] in the wilds of Mithrim, where some Grey-elves yet remained.
