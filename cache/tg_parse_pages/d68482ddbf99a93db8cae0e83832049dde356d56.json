The origin of the breed is unknown - perhaps they were among the creatures bred by [[Morgoth]] in the [[Elder Days]].<ref>{{HM|MB}}, p. 218</ref> In any case, [[Gandalf]] listed the Wargs among [[Sauron]]'s servants in the late [[Third Age]].<ref>{{FR|II1}}</ref>\n\nThe Wargs were seen in [[Rhovanion]] and they were often allied with the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]], and used as mounts. Wargs were clever and used a tongue, the \"[[Wolf-language|dreadful language of the Wargs]]\". They feared fire and could not climb trees.<ref name=\"H6\" />\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ron Walotsky - Wargs.jpg|thumb|left|Ron Walotsky - ''Wargs'']]\nIn {{TA|2941}}, the Wargs appeared once to meet the [[Orcs|Goblins]] and organize a raid to the nearby villages, in order to drive the [[Woodmen]] out and capture some slaves. As a pack of Wargs approached east of the [[Misty Mountains]] to meet them, [[Bilbo Baggins]], [[Gandalf]], and [[Thorin and Company]] were escaping the goblins. Gandalf seeing the pack coming, suggested to climb the trees and [[Dori]] helped Bilbo in the nick of time. \n\nThe Wargs, thinking that the Dwarves are allies of the Woodmen, surrounded the glade and didn't let them descend. Gandalf then used his [[magic]] to light up pinecones and hurl them against the Warg until he drove them out. The wolves that had caught fire fled into the forest and had set it alight in several places, since it was high summer, and on this eastern side of the mountains there had been little rain for some time. However the guards left under the trees did not go away. Eventually Goblins showed up and lit the trees the Dwarves were onto, until the [[Eagles]] came to rescue them.<ref name=\"H6\">{{H|6}}</ref>\n\nThe Goblins and the Wargs insisted on looking for the band, since Gandalf had killed the [[Great Goblin]], and also burnt the chief wolf's nose. They went as far as [[Beorn]]'s homestead, but he caught a pair of them and stuck the goblin's head outside the gate and nailed the warg-skin to a tree just beyond<ref name=\"Queer\">{{H|7}}</ref>\n\nWargs appeared once more, ridden by the Goblins, at the [[Battle of Five Armies]].<ref name=\"H17\">{{H|17}}</ref> After this, the Wargs had vanished from the woods, so that men went abroad without fear.<ref>{{H|18}}</ref>\n\nA band of Wargs, unaccompanied by Orcs, attacked the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] in [[Eregion|Hollin]].<ref>{{FR|II4}}, pp. 297-9</ref>\n\n==Etymology and names==\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] derived the word ''warg'' from [[Old English]] ''wearg-'', Old High German ''warg-'', and [[Old Norse]] ''varg''-r., all of these terms literally translating to ''strangler'', ''choker''.<ref name=\"Gene\" /><ref>[[Douglas A. Anderson]], ''[[The Annotated Hobbit: Revised and Expanded Edition]]'', pp. 146-7, note 9</ref> The word specifically is understood to be [[Northern Mannish]] which \"caught on\" throughout the [[Westlands]].<ref>{{L|250}}</ref>\n\nWhile Norse ''vargr'' was a common synonym for ''wolf'', Old English ''wearg'' was used only for an outlaw or hunted criminal.<ref>{{HM|SG}}, \"Appendix C: Old English Poem of Attila\", p. 373 (note 37)</ref>\n\nIn a list of Old English equivalents of [[Elvish]] words, ''[[Balrogs#Etymology|Balrog]]'' is glossed as having the equivalent ''[[Bealuwérig]]''. As noted by [[Christopher Tolkien]], the Old English word contains the elements ''bealu'' (\"evil\"; as in ''bale(ful)'') and ''wearg'' (\"wolf, outlaw\"; whence the ''Wargs'').<ref>{{SM|QA1}}, p. 209</ref>\n\n==Inspiration and influences==\nIn Old Norse mythology, wargs (''vargr'', a synonym for \"wolf\", ''ulfr'') are in particular the wolf [[wikipedia:Fenrir|Fenrir]] and his sons [[wikipedia:Skoll|Skoll]] and [[wikipedia:Hati|Hati]].\n\nTolkien mentioned in a letter that the episode of wargs in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' was \"in part derived from a scene\" in [[Wikipedia:Samuel Rutherford Crockett|S. R. Crockett]]'s novel ''[[The Black Douglas]]''.<ref>{{L|306}}</ref>\n\nTolkien also noted that [[Gene Wolfe]], one of his readers, seems to have picked up his concept of the Wargs, which occurs in Wolfe's science fiction short story \"Trip, Trap\" (1967): \"There was also what looked like a very big wild dog or wolf, a Warg\".<ref name=\"L297\" /><ref name=\"MB2257\">{{HM|MB}}, p. 225, note 7</ref> [[John D. Rateliff]] has further commented that Tolkien's Wargs were likely influential on the creation of the wolf-like beasts ''[[Wikipedia:Worg (Dungeons & Dragons)|worgs]]'' in later literature related to [[Dungeons and Dragons|Dungeons & Dragons]] and in other fantasy worlds.<ref name=\"MB2257\" />\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Wargs in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Hobbit (1977 film) - Wargs.png|Wargs in [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1977 film)]]\nFile:Susan Van Camp - Wargs.jpg|Wargs in ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]''\nFile:Ron Walotsky - Wargs.jpg|Wargs in ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]''\nFile:Chris Trevas - War-warg.jpg|War-warg in ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]''\nFile:Stephen A.

They do not have a fear of fire.\n\n'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''\n:Wargs appear during the film as cavalry mounted by Orcs and attack Rohan's people en route to [[Helm's Deep]]; they are also seen throughout the siege of [[Minas Tirith]] among Sauron's forces, and one is ridden by [[Gothmog (Lieutenant of Morgul)|Gothmog]]. Rather than being depicted as just demonic wolves as described by Tolkien, the Wargs shown here are comparable in size to horses and seem to superficially resemble hyenas more so than wolves. They are heavily built, with broad, boxy skulls with eyes placed very close to the snout, and thick manes on their necks. They have rather stout limbs and short tails.\n\n'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:'''\n:The Wargs are visually more wolf-like than in the preceding [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' films]]; their builds are overall more slender, with longer limbs and slimmer skulls. Their eyes notably have slit pupils. They are mentioned to be from [[Gundabad]] and are ridden by [[Orcs]] under [[Azog]] who hunt Thorin and Co. Azog himself rides an enormous [[Warg Matriarch|white-haired Warg]].\n\n===Series===\n'''2022: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'':'''\n:A Warg is set upon [[Arondir]] and the other members of a rebellion in an Orc labour camp in ''[[Adar (episode)|Adar]]''. Wargs are seen in the same camp, caged, in ''[[The Great Wave]]''\n\n===Games===\n'''1982-1997: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''\n:Classified as Undead Beings, the Wargs are said to be bred from cursed wolves, inhabited by an evil spirit, \"''being artificially long-lived''\", and that their \"''body dissipates when slain''\". The Wargs are described as being larger, fiercer, and more intelligent than normal wolves.<ref>{{ICE|2012}}, p. 129</ref><ref>{{ICE|2016}}, p. 151</ref>\n\n'''1995-8: ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]'':''' \n:Wargs are a Hazard Creature. Different factions of Wargs are the ''Wargs of the Forochel'' and the ''Misty Mountain Wargs'', and related minions are the ''War-warg'' and ''The Warg-king''.\n\n'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''\n:Wargs are taller and darker than regular wolves, but due to the progression in the game, pose less of a threat; whereas wolves are only encountered by a stick-wielding [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], wargs appear only in levels in which the player is [[Gandalf]] or [[Aragorn]].\n\n'''2003: [[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|''The Hobbit'' (2003 video game)]]:'''\n:Wargs are portrayed as large wolves. They only appear in cutscenes, and are non-fightable.\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Wargs, including Wargs ridden by [[Orcs|Orcs and Goblins]], are a common enemy found throughout the game. \"Warg Stalkers\" are one of the Monster Player classes available for Player versus Monster Player combat in the [[Ettenmoors]]. Monster Player Wargs rely on stealth to ambush players, and some computer-controlled Wargs also demonstrate this ability.\n\n:They look and fight rather like [[Wolves]], and both are classified as Beasts, but Wargs are of a distinct type and appearance , being more monstrous than ordinary wolves. Their appearances vary, typically depending on region, and Warg Stalkers can acquire and choose from several such cosmetic appearances.\n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Images of Wargs|Images of Wargs]]\n{{References}}\n{{Wolves}}\n\n[[de:Warge]]\n[[fr:encyclo/biologie/faune/wargs]]\n[[fi:Hukat]]\n[[Category:Other races]]\n[[Category:Wolves]]\n[[Category:Servants of Sauron]]\n[[Category:Servants of Saruman]]"}}}
