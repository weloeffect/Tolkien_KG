These hills are barely visible on the original map because they are drawn in pencil, but they appear very clearly on the map drawn by Christopher Tolkien<ref>{{WJ|11}}, Sheet 4 - South-east, p.185</ref>.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Hills]]\n[[Category:Beleriand]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n\n[[de:Andram]]\n[[fi:Andram]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/reliefs/beleriand/andram]]"}}}
