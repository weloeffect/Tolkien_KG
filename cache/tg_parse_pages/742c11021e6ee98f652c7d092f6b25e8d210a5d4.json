We then see a recap of [[Gandalf]]'s confrontation with the [[Durin's Bane|Balrog]] in the scene \"[[The Bridge of Khazad-dûm (scene)|The Bridge of Khazad-dûm]]\" from [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|''The Fellowship of the Ring'']]. Gandalf tells the Balrog it cannot pass, then breaks the [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm|bridge]], sending it falling into the abyss. However, as it falls, it swings its whip upwards and pulls Gandalf over the edge.\n\nGandalf and the Balrog fall together, fighting, into a seemingly bottomless chasm, until finally they plunge into water. At that moment, the scene switches to [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] in the [[Emyn Muil]], where Frodo jerks awake, calling Gandalf's name. Reassuring Sam that nothing is wrong, just a dream, Frodo lies down again.\n\n==Differences==\nThe confrontation at the Bridge of Khazad-dûm follows the account in the chapter [[The Bridge of Khazad-dûm]] from ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' fairly closely. Gandalf's fall into the abyss with the Balrog reflects the beginning of Gandalf's account in the chapter [[The White Rider]] from ''[[The Two Towers]]'': \"''Long I fell, and he fell with me. His fire was about me. I was burned. Then we plunged into the deep water and all was dark''.\"<ref>{{TT|White}}, p. 501.</ref> The main deviation from the source material is presenting this fall separately from the [[Battle of the Peak]], which will be shown later.\n\nFrodo does not dream about Gandalf's fight with the Balrog in the book. However, in ''The Fellowship of the Ring'', he has what appears to be a visionary dream about Gandalf's imprisonment in [[Orthanc]].<ref>{{FR|Council}}, p. 261.</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers scenes|01]]"}}}
