The second element was said to be derived from ''[[oron]]'' (\"tree\"), though a later addition also ties it to the [[Sundocarmë|root]] [[RUN]] (\"rub, grind, smooth, polish\"). In this light, the tree was named ''lebethorn'', and the wood of the tree ''lebethron'', and the two words merged into one over time.
