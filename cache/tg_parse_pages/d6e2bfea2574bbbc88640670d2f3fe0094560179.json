It allows you to tell your own epic saga, following your heroes in their quest as the tale of years unfolds before them.\n\nThis supplement includes enough adventure material to keep you playing for months or even years, as well as new rules that give your heroes a real stake in what happens to the world around them. Rules for Holdings allow them to carve out their own corner of Middle-earth, whilst new options for the Fellowship Phase and Undertakings to achieve allow them to chart their own path.\n\nVisit the Parliament of Spiders, do battle with the Nazgûl, meddle in the affairs of Wizards and enter the Halls of King Thranduil. Stand firm against the Shadow and maybe the Darkening of Mirkwood can be averted. Falter for even a moment and all that you know and love will be lost.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.cubicle7.co.uk/our-games/the-one-ring/the-one-ring-the-darkening-of-mirkwood/ Official page]\n{{references}}\n{{title|italics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Darkening of Mirkwood, The}}\n[[Category:The One Ring (role-playing game)]]"}}}
