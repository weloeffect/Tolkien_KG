Tolkien Audio Collection''' is a collection of audio recordings of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], as well as [[Christopher Tolkien]] released in [[2001]] on CD.\n\n==From the publisher==\n{{blockquote|For generations, J.R.R. Tolkien's words have brought to thrilling life a world of hobbits, magic, and historic myth, woken from its foggy slumber within our minds. Here, he tells the tales is his own voice.<br><br>\nOf historic note, these selections from [[The Hobbit]] and [[The Lord of the Rings]] are based on a tape recording Tolkien made in [[1952]], which inspired him to continue his own quest to see his vision in print. Also included is a never-published poem, \"[[The Mirror of Galadriel]],\" originally intended for inclusion in the trilogy, yet edited out. And, finally, Tolkien's son, [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]], reads selections from his father's [[The Silmarillion]], the epic foundation upon which rests the whole of his work.}}\n\n==Track listing==\n===CD 1===\n<poem>\nSongs and excerpts from \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" read by J.R.R.
