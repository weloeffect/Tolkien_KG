The region only appears in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''.\n\n== History ==\nIn the days in which the [[Noldoli]] [[Flight of the Noldor|fled]] from [[Valinor]], a neck of ice called the [[Helkaraksë]] stretched out from the western lands across the water that divided them from the Great Lands. It came almost to the eastern shore, but was separated from it by the Qerkaringa, a treacherous passage of water. The gulf around the isthmus and narrow sound was full of ice floes and dangerous currents. \n\nAfter arriving at the shores, the Noldoli tried and failed to cross the gulf in boats. The could not cross the Helkaraksë because of the Qerkaringa, where water and ice crashed through the strait, making it impassable. While they were camped on the shores, the cold increased, and the Qerkaringa became jammed with ice, stopping the current. Over this ice the Noldoli made the dangerous crossing of the Qerkaringa onto the eastern shore, though many of them were lost.<ref>{{LT1|VII}}, pp. 166-9</ref> \n\n== Etymology ==\nThe first element in the [[Qenya]] name ''Qerkaringa'' is likely ''qerka'' (\"throat\").<ref>{{PE|16}}, p. 136</ref> It also contains ''ringa'' (\"damp, cold, chilly\").<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, pp. 264-5</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nIn an earlier draft of the text describing this region in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', ''Qerkaringa'' refers to the neck of land, although it is stated the name is also sometimes applied to the sound of water by extension. [[Tolkien]] later decided ''Qerkaringa'' was the water, and called the neck of land ''Helkaraksë''. He made a note specifying which name belonged to which in the margins.<ref>{{LT1|VIIn}}, note 5</ref>\n\nIn the published [[Silmarillion]], the dangerous ice-filled strait between [[Middle-earth]] and [[Araman]] was the [[Helcaraxë]]. It was crossed by [[Fingolfin]] and those of the [[Noldor]] left behind by [[Fëanor]].<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Helcaraxë]]\n* [[Wiruin]]\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Aman]]\n[[Category:Bodies of water]]\n[[Category:Coasts]]\n[[Category:Locations in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Qenya locations]]"}}}
