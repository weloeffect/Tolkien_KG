Both ranges were created when the [[Valar]] thrust the centre of Middle-earth to the east as extra protection for [[Valinor]].<ref>{{SM|5b}} p. 239</ref>\n\nIn the [[Ambarkanta maps]], the Yellow Mountains are not shown on Map V, labelled ''\"After the [[Battle of the Powers|War of the Gods]]\"''.\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''1989: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]—[[Shadow in the South]]''''' \n:The Yellow Mountains ([[Quenya|Q.]] ''Orolanari'', [[Sindarin|S.]] ''Ered Laranor'') were volcanic mountains with black and yellow landforms. They were said to rise to heights of up to 10,000 feet. When [[Ormal]] fell, the mountains were swept to the south and east, forming the spine of the utter South.\n\n:The mountains' caverns and caves were home to the Mablâd, local [[Dwarves]] who named themselves after the earth's steam (Mabûl). They guarded the wealth of the mountains: [[silver]], [[Stones_in_Middle-earth_Role_Playing#Laen|laen]], and [[Metals_in_Middle-earth_Role_Playing#Eog|eog]].<ref name=\"south\">{{ICE|3900}}, p. 11</ref>\n\n:There were five notable passes through the Yellow Mountains:\n# The Elornan Cut, which was the safe northernmost pass, located near the headwaters of the river Sireshan.\n# The Pel Stairs, a fog-covered defile prone to rockfalls, situated between Mirëdor and Pel.\n# Trenth Walk, also known as the Pass of Ages, which was a safe hewn trail between Alsarias and Trenth, passing along the Mablâd stronghold Blackfame. Passage required a toll to be paid.\n# Cirith Celiant (S. “Silverbridge Pass”, Pel ''Fâdaraja Cupita'') which followed the river Celiant.\n# The Aeluin Crossing, the southernmost route, which actually cut between the mountains and high foothills.<ref name=\"south\"/>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Eastern lands]]\n[[Category:Mountain ranges]]\n[[de:Gelbes Gebirge]]\n[[fi:Keltavuoret]]"}}}
