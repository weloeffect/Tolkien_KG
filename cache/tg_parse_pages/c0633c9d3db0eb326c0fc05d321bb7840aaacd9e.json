He loved being outdoors, and became a [[Shirriff]] so he could meet new people (and, equally important, inns).<ref name=\"Scouring\">{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>\n\nOriginally one of only twelve,<ref>{{FR|Prologue}}</ref> during [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]]' reign, Robin found himself in over his head. He was reassigned to the [[First Eastfarthing Troop]] in [[Frogmorton]], tasked with enforcing [[The Rules]]. \n\nRobin was one of the Shirriffs sent to arrest [[Travellers|four Hobbits]] who had illegally entered the Shire at the [[Brandywine Bridge]]. It was more of an escort than an arrest, as Robin and his troops were on foot and the four Hobbits had ponies. At the [[Three-Farthing Stone]], the Shirriffs gave up and let their prisoners go on without them.<ref name=\"Scouring\" /> It's not stated if he was among the Sheriffs who joined in the revolt.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Smallburrow\" may imply Robin came from a poor family, as only the rich lived in [[smials]]. His name bears some resemblance to the mythical [http://www.boldoutlaw.com/puckrobin/puckbals.html Robin Goodfellow].\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Angelo Montanini - Robin Smallburrow.jpg|Robin Smallburrow in ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring (video game) - Robin Smallburrow.JPG|Robin Smallburrow in [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game - Robin Smallburrow, Shirriff Cock-Robin.jpg|Robin Smallburrow: [[Shirriff]] Cock-Robin in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Robin Smallburrow.jpg|Robin Smallburrow in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n'''1995: ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]'':'''\n:A \"Robin Smallburrow\" card, illustrated by [[Angelo Montanini]], was produced as part of [[1995]]'s ''[[Middle-earth: The Wizards]]'' expansion.\n\n'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''\n:Robin Smallburrow can be found at the [[Green Dragon]], voiced by an uncredited [[James Arnold Taylor]]. [[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins]] orders [[Frodo Baggins]] to ring the town bell to warn Robin that wolves are in the Shire, which Robin will dismiss as being a rumour. Later at night, he is attacked by a wolf on the streets of [[Bywater]]. Frodo can either let the wolf kill him, or save him to increase his Purity meter.\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'':'''\n:Despite not featuring in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]], Decipher produced a card depicting the character. He was played by [[Timothy Bartlett]].\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Shirriff Robin Smallburrow is found at ''[[The Ivy Bush]]'' tavern in [[Hobbiton]]. He helps the player to deal with a problem in [[Overhill]] and is also involved in several seasonal festivals.\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:Hobbits]]\n[[Category:Smallburrow]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n\n[[de:Rudolf Kleinbau]]\n[[fi:Tikli Kolonala]]"}}}
