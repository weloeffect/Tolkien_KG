Tolkien}}\nThe '''1952 tape recording''' refers to a private [[Index:Audio recordings of J.R.R. Tolkien|audio recording]] by [[George Sayer]] of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] in late August [[1952]].\n\nTolkien was visiting his friends (George Sayer and his wife) when the recording of Tolkien singing and reading excerpts from ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and the then unpublished manuscript of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' was performed.<ref name=WH>{{webcite|author=[[Wayne G.

This note was a mistake, but has been reprinted on subsequent releases from Caedmon.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.facebook.com/groups/TheTolkienSociety.EducationalCharity/permalink/10154695982936068/|articlename=Tolkien Society Facebook group post|dated=|website=TS|accessed=8 January 2017}}</ref> [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Douglas A. Anderson]] have given the following account regarding the mistaken note:\n\n{{blockquote|Sleeve notes by Ward Botsford and George Sayer. Botsford incorrectly identifies side B, band 16 as an unpublished poem for LR, book 2, ch.7... in fact the verse ([[In Dwimordene, in Lórien|In Dwimordene, in Lorien...]]) was published in LR, bk.3, ch.6|<ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond]] (with the assistance of [[Douglas A. Anderson]]), ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography]]'', p. 384</ref>}}\n\nAccording to [[George Sayer]], selections which were not issued include Tolkien reading the Lord's Prayer in [[Gothic]] (and perhaps also in English): he had never seen a tape recorded before \"''and said whimsically that he ought to cast out any devil that might be in it by recording a prayer, the Lord’s Prayer in Gothic''\". Caedmon also cut out \"''conversation which occurred in between his readings from his works''\". It is unknown if the original tapes are still extant.<ref name=WH/>\n\n==Publication==\n\n*[[1975]]: ''[[J.R.R Tolkien Reads and Sings His The Hobbit and The Fellowship of the Ring]]''\n*[[1975]]: ''[[J.R.R Tolkien Reads and Sings His The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers/The Return of the King]]''\n*[[2003]]: ''[[The Spoken Word: Children's Writers]]''\n*[[2003]]: ''[[The Spoken Word: Writers]]''\n*[[2007]]: ''[[Essential Tolkien]]''\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Interviews with J.R.R.
