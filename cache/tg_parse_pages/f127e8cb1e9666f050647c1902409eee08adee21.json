Upon being freed, however, Turin mistook Beleg for an Orc and murdered him with Beleg's own sword, [[Anglachel]]. Upon realizing the horror of what he had just done, Turin fell into a frozen state of shock and allowed himself to be led by Gwindor to the [[Pools of Ivrin]]. Once there, he drank from the pure waters and was healed, and was at last able to weep, mourning Beleg. Then he composed and sang this lament as a form of release in his grief, singing it aloud regardless of peril.<ref name=\"Beleg\">{{CH|9}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Laer Cú Beleg'' is [[Sindarin]] for \"Song of the Great Bow\",<ref name=\"Beleg\" /> from ''[[laer]]'' (\"song\"), ''[[cú]]'' (\"bow\") and ''[[Beleg (word)|beleg]]'' (\"great, mighty; large, big\").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2210392017.html|articlename=S.

It appears for the first time in ''[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]'', in which it is called the '''Bowman's Friendship''', and it is said that the [[Gnomes]] remembered it in [[Nargothrond]], and that it was a song used in battles against [[Morgoth]].<ref>{{LB|1d}}, p. 64, vv. 1662-1665</ref> The same name is given to it in the following versions of the story in the ''[[Sketch of the Mythology]]''<ref>{{SM|2}}, [Section] 12, p. 29</ref> and the ''[[Quenta Noldorinwa]]''.<ref>{{SM|Q12}}, p. 124</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Lays and tales within the legendarium]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]"}}}
