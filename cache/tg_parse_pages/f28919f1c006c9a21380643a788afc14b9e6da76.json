Some of them occupied the cairn of the [[last prince of Cardolan]].<ref name=\"Eriador\" /><ref>{{HM|RC}}, \"Fog on the Barrow-downs\", pp. 144-5; Index, 'Cardolan, [[Last prince of Cardolan|last prince of]]'</ref> The spirits stirred the dead bones in the mounds and haunted them.<ref name=\"Eriador\">{{App|Eriador}}</ref><ref name=\"Elendil\">{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 194</ref><ref name=\"I7\">{{FR|I7}}</ref>\n\nThe Barrow-wights appeared as shadowy figures with a pale, icy light gleaming from what would be their eyes.

Their chief, the [[Witch-king]], moved to [[Andrath]] and visited the Barrow-downs, where he stayed for three days in order to rouse the Barrow-wights. According to the rare manuscript ''[[The Hunt for the Ring|The Hunt for the Ring: Time Scheme - Black Riders]]'', the [[Witch King]] empowered the Barrow-wights and slew the [[Ranger]]s in order to trap the [[Ring]]-bearer - a strategy that would almost work; he left on September 27.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, \"Fog on the Barrow-downs\", p. 145-6</ref><ref name=\"RC\">{{HM|RC}}, \"Flight to the Ford\", p. 180</ref><ref>{{UT|Other}}</ref> \n\n[[Frodo Baggins]] and company were trapped in the [[Barrow-downs]] by the [[magic|spells]] of the Barrow-wights, and were nearly slain by the creatures.<ref name=\"Barrow\">{{FR|I8}}</ref> They were saved in the last minute by Tom, who seemed to have had complete authority over them.\n\n==Other names==\n\nAccording to [[Elrond]], the [[Elves]] knew the Barrow-wights by many names.<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref> While these names are not recorded (except for the general denomination \"evil spirits\"), the creatures were also called \"'''Barrow-dwellers'''\" in Hobbit lore.<ref name=\"AB1\">{{AB|1}}</ref> Often, they were also referred to by the shortened form \"'''Wights'''\".<ref name=\"LotR\" /><ref>The use of a capital \"W\" for the short form was noted by {{webcite|author=Jerome Colburn|articleurl=https://tolkienlistsearch.herokuapp.com/message/5e9c35dd6beb162366dc0f94|articlename=Re: tolkienian english (197.11)|dated=2002-11-24|website=[[Elfling]]|accessed=2022-09-23}}; compare \"''They are Elvish wights''\", in {{RK|Company}}</ref>\n\n*Etymology: ''[[Barrows|barrow]]'' + ''[[wights|wight]]''\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nDue to his inspiration from ''Hrómundar saga Gripssonar'', during the writing of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (see ''[[The History of The Lord of the Rings]]'') Tolkien at first foresaw a link between the wights and the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraith]]s, initially describing the Black Riders as horsed Wights, but the suggestion that they were the same kind of creatures was dropped in the published work.
