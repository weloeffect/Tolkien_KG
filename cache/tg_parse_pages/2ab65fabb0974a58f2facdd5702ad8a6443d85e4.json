One player must bring Frodo Baggins — the [[Ringbearer]] — and his Hobbit friends from their home in the [[Shire]] to the sanctuary of Rivendell, where the fate of the One Ring will be decided. Using secrecy and the help of powerful allies, the Ringbearer must escape the chase of the [[Nazgûl]], the terrible Ringwraiths, controlled by up to four other players. The Ringwraith players work together to find Frodo and recover the Ring for their [[Sauron|Dark Lord]], while the Ringbearer secretly tracks his path first from [[Hobbiton]] to [[Bree]], then from Bree to Rivendell, on a double–sided game board.\n\n\n==External links==\n* '''[https://www.aresgames.eu/games/war-of-the-ring-line/hunt-for-the-ring Official Site]'''\n* [https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/216070/hunt-for-the-ring Board Game Geek Profile]\n{{references}}\n{{title}}\n[[Category:Board games]]"}}}
