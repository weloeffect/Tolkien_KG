In this work Merry discussed the relation of the [[Shire Calendar|calendars]] of [[the Shire]] and [[Bree Calendar|of]] [[Bree]] to those of [[Reckoning of Rivendell|Rivendell]], [[New Reckoning|Gondor]], and [[Rohan]].\n\nThis book was one of the important tomes kept in the library of [[Bucklebury]], perhaps one of those important works that were not copied into the [[Red Book]].<ref>{{FR|Records}}</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\n\"Reckoning of Years\" is a rendering into English of ''[[Wikipedia:The Reckoning of Time|De temporum ratione]]'', the title of an important treatise on astronomy and timekeeping by the seventh-century English monk Bede. This work is the sole source of the Anglo-Saxon names of the months of the year, which Tolkien adapted for the [[Shire Calendar]].\n\nTolkien likely intended this work to be taken as the source for the information in \"[[Appendix D]]\" of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', although the [[Prologue Concerning Hobbits, and other matters|Prologue]] suggests that it was not included in the Red Book.\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Books and documents within the legendarium]]\n[[de:Jahreszählung]]\n[[fi:Ajan laskeminen]]"}}}
