It opened into the passage that led to bottommost cellar of the halls of the dwarves.\n\n[[Image:J.R.R. Tolkien - The Lonely Mountain.jpg|thumb|300px|J.R.R. Tolkien's schematic drawing of the Lonely Mountain with the secret entrance, labeled the \"Back Door\", in the center.]]\n\nThe Back Door’s dimensions were described on [[Thrór's Map]] as: \"Five feet high the door and three may walk abreast.\"  When [[Gandalf]] brought out the map at the unexpected party in [[Bilbo Baggins]]' home he also produced the small and curious silver key with a long barrel and intricate wards, which would open the door.<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref>  Later, [[Elrond]] was given permission to examine Thrór's Map and discovered the [[moon-letters]] which revealed the method of opening the door. Elrond read them out as: \"Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks and the setting sun with the last light of [[Durin's Day]] will shine upon the key-hole.\"<ref>{{H|Rest}}</ref>\n\nWhen Bilbo and the dwarves reached the Lonely Mountain they eventually found rough steps that led upwards to a little steep-walled bay above a cliff.  In the back was a flat wall that rose as smooth and upright as masons' work.  Although without any sign of a post or lintel or threshold, nor any sign of bar or bolt or key-hole, they knew that they had found the door.  Days passed and then, on Durin's Day, a thrush came to a grey stone in the bay and knocked a snail against the rock.  Right at sunset a last gleam of light struck the smooth rock-face and with a crack a flake of rock fell from the wall and revealed a keyhole.  After [[Thorin]] turned the key in the hole the dwarves pushed the door inward and the way into the mountain was opened.<ref>{{H|Doorstep}}</ref>\n{{references}}\n{{companyroute}}\n[[Category:Doors and gates]]\n[[fi:Sivuovi (Erebor)]]"}}}
