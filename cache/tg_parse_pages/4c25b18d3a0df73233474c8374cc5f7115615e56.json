The other two kingdoms were named [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]].\n\nUnlike his forefathers, the first king of Arthedain, Amlaith, did not take a name in [[Quenya]],<ref>{{App|North}}, ''Arthedain''. Amlaith of Fornost, footnote</ref> the \"High-elven Tongue\",<ref>{{App|Elves}}, first paragraph</ref> but instead took a name in [[Sindarin]], as did all the Kings of Arthedain and [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain]] that descended from him.<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, manuscript C with corrections and expansions, The Northern Line of Arnor: the Isildurioni, 10.

Arvedui, the last king, fled to the north, where he perished in a winter storm while trying to escape the frozen wastes of [[Forochel]]. Arvedui's son, Aranath, chose not to claim the kingship and instead became the first [[Chieftain of the Dúnedain]] in {{TA|1976}}.<ref name=\"TA\"/> This marked the end of the kingship, though not of the dynasty of Isildur.\n\n==Duties and office==\nThe duties would have been highly similar to those of the [[Kings of Arnor]], though much reduced in scale. Several kings were involved in the wars against Angmar, where they would have led the forces of Arthedain against their foes. \n\nThe kings would also share the same badges of office that the Arnorian kings once used: the [[Shards of Narsil]], the [[Ring of Barahir]], and the [[Sceptre of Annuminas]]. After the dissolution of the kingship, these would pass to the keeping of [[Elrond]], with the brief exception of the Ring of Barahir, which had to be retrieved from the [[Lossoth]].<ref name=\"North\"/>\n\nThe kings controlled two of the three northern [[Palantíri]]: those in [[Elostirion]] and [[Annuminas]]. After the fall of [[Amon Sûl]], they would gain the palantìr formerly housed there as well. However, the latter two palantíri would be lost forever in the shipwreck that killed Arevdui.\n\n==List of Kings==\nThe Kings of [[Arthedain]] were of the same lineage of those of [[Arnor]], though are listed separately from them within royal chronicles. \nThe Kings of Arthedain and the duration of their reigns<ref name=\"North\"/> were:\n{|class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|- style=\"background: var(--tg-color-surface-2);\" \n!
