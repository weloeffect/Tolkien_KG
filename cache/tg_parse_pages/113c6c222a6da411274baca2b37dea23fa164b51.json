Considering the book an allegory of the [[Wikipedia:Cold War|Cold War]], some criticism was that the Good is not defined, as the protagonists function unter \"the warrior's code of courage\".<ref>Quoted in {{HM|RC}}, p. xxxv</ref>\n\nWith the publication of ''[[The Two Towers]]'', a reviewer wrote the article \"The Epic of Westernesse\" for the [[17 December]] issue (p.&nbsp;817). According to the review, the \"allegory\" of this 'prose epic in praise of courage', was becoming plainer. The reviewer considered convincing and delightful the described imaginary places; but also criticised the lack of some realistic elements of the [[Secondary World]], such as jobs and [[money]], the role of women, the [[Sea]], while nowhere is explained how evil is [[Sauron]].<ref>Quoted in {{HM|RC}}, p. xxxvi</ref>\n===1955===\n''[[The Return of the King]]'' was reviewed in the article \"The Saga of Middle\nEarth\" on [[25 November]] [[1955]] (p.&nbsp;704). The reviewer considered the work memorable, but not readable more than once; he likened the whole story to a shiny and magnificent edifice, stretching beyond view, with \"further spacious halls as yet unvisited\", but also criticised how Good and Evil were distibguished.\n\nIn the issue of [[9 December]] (p.&nbsp;743), responding to a reader's letter, the\nreviewer wrote that all the book was about the good and the bad, both brave, only trying to kill each other and that \"Morally there seems nothing to choose between them\".<ref>Quoted in {{HM|RC}}, p. xxxvii</ref>\n===2012===\nThe issue of [[14 September]] [[2012]] (published online [[12 September|two days earlier]]) includes the article \"A vision of Middle-earth: Mary Fairburn — Tolkien illustrator\" by Paul Tankard, about the artist [[Mary Fairburn]], her illustrations inspired by [[Middle-earth]], and friendship with [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. Several quotations from formerly [[Letters not published in \"The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien\"|unpublished letters by Tolkien]] are provided.\n{{references}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{WP|The Times Literary Supplement}}\n*\"[http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article1124297.ece An unknown vision of Middle-earth]\" (online version)\n* [http://www.radionz.co.nz/national/programmes/afternoons/audio/2532771/literary-detective-dr-paul-tankard Literary Detective Dr. Paul Tankard] at Radio New Zealand\n\n[[Category:Unsorted journal issues]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
