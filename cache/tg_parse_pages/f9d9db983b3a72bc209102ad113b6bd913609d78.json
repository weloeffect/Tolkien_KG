Upon taking the Passage, a blizzard appears, accompanied by what Legolas calls \"''...a fell voice on the air.''\", to which Gandalf says that \"''It is Saruman.''\" It is shown that Saruman had summoned a great storm to harass the Fellowship on the Pass, until a lightning strike upon the mountain causes an avalanche that buries the Company in snow. At this, Boromir says to turn back and take the Gap of Rohan, to which Aragorn says that it would take the Company too close to Isengard, while Gimli suggests to \"''...go [[Moria|under the mountain]].''\" Gandalf has Frodo decide, as the Ringbearer, and Frodo elects Moria as the way of passage. Additionally, in his [[magic|spell]], Saruman mentions the [[Neo-Elvish|neo-Quenya]] name of Caradhras as ''Carnirassë''.<ref>{{webcite|website=ELF|articlename=Dialogs in FotR|articleurl=http://www.elvish.org/gwaith/movie_fotr.htm#spell|accessed=30 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n'''2008: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Caradhras is featured in the region of [[Eregion]].
