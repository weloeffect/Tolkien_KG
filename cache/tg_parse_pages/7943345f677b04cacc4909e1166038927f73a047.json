He was invented by [[Iron Crown Enterprises]] for ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'', which described him the deadliest and smartest of his kin in the Grey Mountains. As such only [[Scatha]] and [[Smaug]] are noted as his peers. He had blue-tipped black scales and long silvery horns.\n\nHis lair was situated at Gold Hill, which was a knoll full of valuable ores. It was also a strategic site overlooking the \nCirith Auris, a pass used to travel between [[Rhovanion]] and the [[Northern Waste]].<ref name=creatures>{{ICE|2012}}, p. 11</ref> The only known treasure in his hoard is ''Sulthol'' ([[Quenya|Q.]] “Wind Helm”), a helmet made by [[Edain]] who lived northwest of [[Dale]] in the [[Second Age]].<ref name=treasures>{{ICE|2010}}, p. 63</ref>\n\n==History==\nHe got the title of “Guest-eater” after inviting neighbouring [[Northmen|Northman]] chiefs to a banquet, and then killing them instead. This allowed him to focus on the [[Dwarves]], who had sent seven failed expeditions to conquer Gold Hill. The Northman too tried to vanquish the dragon thrice, for his lair was originally a sacred burial ground of theirs.<ref name=creatures/>\n\n{{references|notes}}\n\n[[Category:Dragons from adaptations]]\n[[Category:Middle-earth Role Playing characters]]"}}}
