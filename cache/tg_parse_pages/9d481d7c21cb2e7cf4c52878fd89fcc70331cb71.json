Eventually [[Bill the Pony]] was bought from [[Bill Ferny]] for twelve silver pennies, which was considered to be at least three times its value.  [[Barliman Butterbur]] paid for the beast and also gave Merry eighteen more silver pennies in compensation for the ponies the party had lost.  The loss of thirty silver pennies was quite a financial blow to the innkeeper, even though he was reckoned well-off in [[Bree]].<ref>{{FR|I11}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n\n'''2003: [[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|''The Hobbit'' (2003 video game)]]:'''\n:Silver pennies are collected throughout the PC and console versions, and Bilbo can use them to purchase items between levels at the vendor.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Currencies]]\n[[fi:Hopeapenni]]"}}}
