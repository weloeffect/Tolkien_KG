He may, of course, have lived longer that this.\n\nBëor was the first of Men to encounter the [[Elves]], having led his people across the [[Blue Mountains]] into [[Beleriand]]. He was 49 at the time of that meeting, and died after another forty-four years of service to [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]], at the age of 93.<ref>{{S|Men}}</ref>\n\nThe oldest of the three, though, was Aldor, the third King of Rohan.
