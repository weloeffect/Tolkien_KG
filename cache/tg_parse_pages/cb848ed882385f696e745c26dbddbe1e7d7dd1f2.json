He soon felt alone and wondered whether [[Gandalf]] and the [[Dwarves]] were still inside the Mountain. He was considering going back to find them, when he heard voices. It was Gandalf and the Dwarves. Bilbo still had the [[The One Ring|ring]] on and he was delighted to see [[Balin]] - on lookout - stare right at him without seeing him. Gandalf and the Dwarves were arguing over Bilbo, so he decided to creep in amongst them and surprise them by taking the ring off. The dwarves and even Gandalf were shocked as Bilbo made his presence known. Bilbo's respect amongst the party grew considerably as he told the story of [[Gollum]] and his escape - however he made sure to keep the part about the ring to himself.\n\nGandalf hastened the party the move quickly away from the mountains to make as much progress as possible - despite their lack of ponies, luggage and food. They traveled along rough terrain, indeed they found themselves sliding down the remnants of a landslide. Eventually they made it to a large clearing where no trees grew; no sooner had they reached this point did they hear a howl from down hill. Gandalf ordered everyone to climb the trees at the edge of the glade. Just as Bilbo and [[Dori]] managed to climb into a tree, the opening had been filled with hundreds of [[Wargs]]. They had come to meet the goblins as they had planned to carry out a great goblin-raid on the near-by villages. Gandalf could understand the language of the Wargs, and even he was scared. He therefore decided to collect huge pine-cones, and set them alight before hurling them down into the wolves. The Wargs were both terrified and enraged as their coats caught fire.\n\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - The Misty Mountains looking West from the Eyrie towards Goblin Gate (Colored by H.E. Riddett).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Misty Mountains]] looking West from the Eyrie towards Goblin Gate (Colored by [[H.E. Riddett]]).]]\n\nThe [[Great Eagle|Lord of the Eagles]] of the Misty Mountains could hear the voices of the Wargs and saw the commotion at a great distance. He was curious about what was happening and decided to summon his fellow eagles to fly with him towards the wolves and the meeting-place of the goblins.\n\nAs the goblins approached the meeting place, they thought that a battle with the wood-men was going on. They ran and yelled; some put the fires out, however they encouraged the fires nearest the trees feeding it with dead branches and bracken. Soon there was smoke and flame all around the dwarves, the hobbit and the wizard. The goblins began to mock them as they sang. Gandalf climbed to the top of his tree; just as he reached the top, the Lord of the Eagles seized him in his talons. The eagles rescued Bilbo and the Dwarves, to a great howl of anger from the goblins. They flew them to their [[Eagle's Eyrie|Eyrie]] high in the Mountains; there Gandalf thanked the Lord of the Eagles and asked for his assistance in the journey east. He would not take them too far east, but agreed to take them as far as they would. Bilbo and Gandalf complained of their hunger, therefore the Lord of the Eagles ensured that the adventurers were brought fuel for a fire and food to eat. There they slept, quite soundly, upon the hard rock high in the [[Misty Mountains]].\n{{references}}\n[[Category:The Hobbit chapters]]\n[[fi:Ojasta allikkoon]]"}}}
