At one time [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] seems to have hesitated about this sense of the root, writing: \"[√POL] cannot refer to ''strength''\", since it is \"[t]oo obvious a reminiscence of ''pollens''\"<ref group=\"note\">Tolkien is apparently not referring to an [[Elvish]] word, but instead to the English word ''[[Wikipedia:Pollen|pollens]]'' (''pollens'' does not occur in any [[Sindarin]] or Quenya compilations of words). This interpretations is perhaps corroborated by the alternative signification of the root POL as \"break up small, reduced to power\".<!-- Suggested by User:Morgan --></ref> and \"also it does not account for ''poli-'' 'meal'\". He therefore proposed the revised signification \"'pound up', break small, reduced to powder etc\". However, the original sense of POL ultimately seems to have been retained, and Tolkien instead proposed a change of the word ''pole'' (\"meal\"; cf.
