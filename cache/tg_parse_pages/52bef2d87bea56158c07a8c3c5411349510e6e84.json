Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s works, and the potential sources behind them. The documentary is narrated by [[Ian Holm]], who played [[Bilbo Baggins]] in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' films]].\n\n==Summary==\n\nThe documentary explores the locations and events in Tolkien's life that influenced his works, and his languages. Looking at Tolkien's upbringing in [[Warwickshire]] and [[Birmingham]], the documentary looks into the [[wikipedia:West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] region of England - the former kingdom of [[wikipedia:Mercia|Mercia]] - and how locations inspired his vision of [[the Shire]]. The documentary also looks into Tolkien's time at [[Oxford]], his experience in the [[First World War]], and his visits to [[wikipedia:Stonyhurst College|Stonyhurst College]]. \n==Original press release==\n{{blockquote|The Real Middle-Earth is a brand new documentary that uncovers the real places that inspired The Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>Sir Ian Holm (Fellowship of the Ring, Alien, The Borrowers) narrates a fascinating exploration into a world that, although imaginary, seems so solid we pore over its maps and contemplate journeys made from one place to another.<br/><br/>Is this because the foundations of fantastic [[Middle-earth|Middle-Earth]] were laid on the bedrock of factual places?<br/><br/>Was there a shire to inspire the Shire? What shaped the darker and more troubled lands beyond its borders? How did European languages fuse in Tolkien's mind to create a vocabulary that evokes extraordinary places and heroic adventure?<br/><br/>The quest for The Real Middle-Earth takes us to England's west midlands, to Warwick and Oxford, to an ancient Lancashire school, to Saxon burial sites and many other places, including the real [[Dead Marshes]], otherwise known as the Great War battlefields of [[Battle of the Somme|the Somme]].<br/><br/>The Real Middle-Earth is 58 minutes long. There are also 50 minutes of extras on the DVD, including a profile of the official The Lord of the Rings mapmaker and a look behind the scenes at the prosthetics teams behind some of the LOTR movies' special effects.}}\n\n==Contributors==\n* [[Helen Armstrong]], [[Tolkien Society]] scholar\n* Peter Bennett, [[wikipedia:River Cole, West Midlands|River Cole]] Conservation Group\n* Ian Collier, Tolkien Society scholar\n* [[Patrick Curry]], author of ''[[Defending Middle-earth]]''\n* [[John Garth]], author of ''[[Tolkien and the Great War]]''\n* Janet Graffius, Curator of Stonyhurst College Museum\n* Jonathan Hewatt, Stonyhurst College\n* Peter Leather, lecturer at University of Birmingham in Birmingham's history\n\n==External links==\n\n*[http://www.janson.com/rights/the-real-middle-earth The Real Middle Earth] at Janson, current distributors\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Documentaries]]\n[[fi:The Real Middle-earth (Documentary)]]"}}}
