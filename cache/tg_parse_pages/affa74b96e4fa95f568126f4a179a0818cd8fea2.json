The land ran down toward the river in slopes and terraces. The City of Minas Tirith was located on the south-western corner of the fields, at the foot of [[Mindolluin|Mount Mindolluin]].\n\nA road ran north-east across the Pelennor Fields to the [[Causeway Forts]] on the river bank; a distance of 12 miles. The [[Great West Road|North-way]] led from the City through the fields to the [[Forannest]], or north-gate, before turning westward to become the [[Great West Road]] to [[Rohan]]. The [[South Road]] came from the southern provinces of Gondor and passed through the Pelennor Fields on the way to Minas Tirith. A number of other paths also crisscrossed the fields.\n\nThe Pelennor Fields were home to farmers and herdsmen who had barns, pens, livestock, granaries, and kilns for drying hops and malt which were located on the Pelennor. The fields were fertile farmland, with tilled fields, orchards, and small brooks flowing down to the Anduin.<ref>{{RK|V1}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nAfter [[Minas Ithil]] had [[Second Fall of Minas Ithil|fallen]] and been renamed [[Minas Morgul]], the Fields were walled by the great wall of [[Rammas Echor]] by [[Ecthelion II]] in {{TA|2954}}, to prevent an invasion.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 546</ref> Presumably, the Fields took their name because of this enclosure.<ref>Cf. [[#Etymology|the Etymology section]] concerning the meaning of the name.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[War of the Ring]], the people and livestock evacuated the lands, seeing the coming invasion of the forces of [[Sauron]] from [[Minas Morgul]]. Indeed, [[Orcs]] and evil [[Men]] overran the Rammas Echor on [[13 March]] and on [[14 March|the next day]] [[Siege of Gondor|besieged the city]].<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref><ref name=Fields/> Homes and trees were burned and trenches were carved through the fields and filled with fire. The Pelennor Fields were the location of the ensuing [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], when [[Théoden]], [[Kings of Rohan|King of Rohan]] and the [[Witch-king|Lord of the Nazgûl]] and his [[Fell beasts|Fell beast]] were slain.<ref name=Fields>{{RK|V6}}</ref>\n\n===After the Battle===\nAfter the battle, the grass began to grow back on the fields. [[Snowmane's Howe]], where [[Théoden]]'s [[Snowmane|horse]] was buried, grew especially green. The location at which the Witch-king and his steed had been killed was stained black and no grass grew from the scorched earth.<ref name=Fields/>\n\nOn [[1 May]] {{TA|3019|n}} the coronation of [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] took place, and those of Gondor and [[Rohan]] gathered on the Pelennor Fields to witness the event.<ref>{{RK|VI5}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe name ''Pelennor'' translates to \"fenced, encircled land\" in [[Sindarin]].<ref name=\"lotrindex\">{{RK|Index}}</ref><ref name=RC>{{HM|UI}}, p. 512</ref><ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 95</ref> [[Christopher Tolkien]] has noted that the first element derives from the [[Elvish]] root/element ''[[PEL|pel-]]'' (\"go round, encircle\");<ref>{{S|Appendix}}</ref> the other elements appear to be ''end'' (from ''enedh'' \"middle\")' + ''[[dôr|(n-)dor]]'' (\"land, dwelling\").<ref>[http://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/compound_sindarin_names#p Compound Sindarin Names in Middle-earth] at [http://www.tolkiendil.com/ Tolkiendil.com] (accessed 27 June 2011)</ref> The field was called by several other names as well, such as ''Fields of Pelennor'', ''the Pelennor'', and ''the townlands''.<ref name=RC/>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Fields, plains and deserts]]\n[[Category:Gondor]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[de:Pelennor]]"}}}
