He became an outlaw in the [[Ered Wethrin]] after [[Túrin]] killed [[Brodda]]. Later, Asgon met [[Húrin]], gave him an account of his son's deeds, and followed him in his wanderings.\n\n==Asgon and Túrin ==\nIn {{FA|496}},<ref name=\"Years\">{{WJ|Hurin}}, p. 257</ref> when Túrin returned to [[Dor-lómin]] after twenty-three years of absence, he came to Brodda's hall seeking news of the whereabouts of his mother [[Morwen]] and sister [[Nienor]]. Due to his rashness Túrin killed Brodda and provoked a brief rebellion against the Easterlings. When he left, those who had joined in the battle followed him, and Asgon was one of these. As the party climbed into the mountains they saw that Brodda's hall was on fire and Asgon reproved Túrin for thinking [[Aerin]] weak. Túrin left the rebels in a cave in the mountains where Asgon told him that they would be hunted men because of Túrin's deed and that he should not return unless it was with enough strength to deliver them.<ref>{{CH|12}}, pp. 190-191</ref>\n\n==Asgon and Húrin ==\nAfter Túrin's death his father Húrin was released by [[Morgoth]] (in {{FA|500}}<ref name=\"Years\"/>). Wandering in [[Hithlum]], Húrin met a small company of homeless men lurking in the hills. Asgon was their leader and he reported Túrin's deeds in Brodda’s hall. Asgon and six others willingly followed Húrin when marched up to the halls of the Easternling [[Lorgan]], who called himself the Lord of [[Hithlum]].  Húrin defied Lorgan who determined to let him leave untouched. When Húrin left Hithlum, Asgon led him through one of the mountain passes. Asgon and the others travelled on with Húrin, but at the edge of the Forest of [[Brethil]] he left them while they slept and traveled alone into [[Dimbar]].\n\nWith Húrin gone, the seven followers were uncertain of what to do. Although one, [[Ragnir (outlaw)|Ragnir]], counseled returning home, Asgon decided that they ought to go into Brethil. Asgon led the party into the forest where they were captured by the [[Haladin]]. The captain of this guard, [[Ebor]], had them blindfolded and led to [[Hardang]], the new Chieftain of the Haladin, who looked unkindly upon the party from [[Dor-lómin]]. Hardang ordered Asgon and his men to be thrust from Brethil without their weapons, which Asgon called the justice of Easterlings not of [[Edain]]. Asgon declared that Húrin was coming, news which put Hardang in fear and doubt. Asgon and his party were blindfolded again and led away, where the march-warden Ebor returned to them their weapons and gear. Asgon, believing that someday Húrin  would come to Brethil, established his men west of the forest to keep watch from afar.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, pp. 261-265</ref>\n\nAfter the ruin of Brethil, Húrin departed west gathering to him Men of Brethil who chose to flee from the growing strength of Morgoth. Asgon was then reunited with Húrin, and elected captain of the wood-men, but he ever deferred to Húrin, and thus accompanied him to Nargothrond.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}</ref>{{rp|note 54}}\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn drafts of ''The Wanderings of Húrin'' Asgon's name originally was \"Asgorn\".<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, Note 21, p. 301</ref>\n  \n{{references}}\n[[Category:Edain]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Folk of Hador]]\n[[de:Asgon]]\n[[fi:Asgon]]"}}}
