In ''[[The Hobbit]]'', [[Thorin and Company]] traverse a small ford made of \"huge flat stones\" that connected only the [[Carrock]] with \"the grass-land beyond the stream\" at the eastern bank of the river. According to [[Gandalf]] \"it is easy enough [...] to get from [the eastern] bank to the Carrock by ford, but on the other side is a cliff standing up from a swirling channel.\" Gandalf could not cross the river there when he was following the track of [[Beorn]].<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref> \n\nThis small ford remains unnamed (without capitals) in ''The Hobbit'' and it is not clear if the \"Ford of Carrock\" mentioned by Glóin in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' refers to that ford. [[Robert Foster]] supposed that Glóin's reference should be to the [[Old Ford]].<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, s.v.
