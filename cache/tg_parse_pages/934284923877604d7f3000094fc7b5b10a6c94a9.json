[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] spent several years as an assistant, and several of his own words and works would be cited in it. \n\n==Early History==\nThe dictionary project started in 1878. Though it was originally not a part of the [[University of Oxford]], the institute took over the project later. The sections covering A-H were published by [[1900]], but both the [[World War I|war]] and the death of Sir [[wikipedia:James Murray (lexicographer)|James Murray]], the original editor, in [[1915]] meant that the section U-Z was not complete yet.<ref name=\"BioOxI\">[[Humphrey Carpenter]], ''[[J.R.R.
