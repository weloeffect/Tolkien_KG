It appears in their second full-length album, [[Sword's Song]].\n==Lyrics==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nHorse lords the men of Rohan \nAllies of Gondor the land below \nGreen fields they guard with honour \nEastern terror, keep away! \nFinest chargers of Middle-earth \nThey raise and ride \nSee the banners of Riddermark \nIf you're foe, you should run or hide \n\nRiver Anduin, Fangorn forest \nMountains of Mist and White Horn \nMighty borders surround the Kingdom \nStrong regions to guard the land \n\nEdoras the heart of Rohan \nCapital of Riddermark \nFortresses around the realm \nDunharrow and Helm's Deep \nCitadels so hard to annex \nVictory in both of them... \nBattle of the Pelennor Fields \nInvasion of Dunlending \n\nThird Age of the Sun \nThe battle of Filed of Celebrant \nOrchish triumph was so near \nThen the third army arrived \nThere's no enemy who \nCould ever oberwhelm those plains of light \nSteal their fate of better times \nAnd kill the fire in their eyes \n\nGolden-haired horsemen \nAnd their King Eorl the Young \nVictory by the Eothed \nSalvation to the southern lands \nGreat reward they have gained \nFrom the people they have saved \nExpression of gratitude \nOn northern fields they stay\n\n\n</poem>\n[[Category:Songs by Battlelore]]"}}}
