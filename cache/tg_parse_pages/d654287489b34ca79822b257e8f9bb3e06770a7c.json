What are you doing,''' is a poem found within the chapter \"[[A Short Rest]]\" of ''[[The Hobbit]]''. It is sung by the [[Elves]] of [[Rivendell]] as the [[Thorin and Company|Company]] crossed the bridge into Rivendell. This poem type is seen once again in the chapter \"[[The Last Stage]]\" called [[The dragon is withered]].\n\nThis poem reflects the joy of the Elven-folk as they seemed not to have a care for the dangers of the world. It was described as \"a burst of song like laughter in the trees\". \"The valley\" refers to [[Rivendell]], their home. After the Elves finished this poem they moved on to another ridiculous [[Elvish Song in Rivendell|song]].\n\n==Text==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nO! What are you doing,\nAnd where are you going?\nYour ponies need shoeing!\nThe river is flowing!\n   O! tra-la-la-lally\n        here down in [[Rivendell|the valley]]!\n\nO! What are you seeking,\nAnd where are you making?\nThe faggots are reeking,\nThe bannocks are baking!\n    O! tril-lil-lil-lolly\n        the valley is jolly,\n             ha! ha!\n\nO! Where are you going\nWith beards all a-wagging?\nNo knowing, no knowing\nWhat brings [[Bilbo Baggins|Mister Baggins]],\n   And [[Balin]] and [[Dwalin]]\n       down into the valley\n            in June\n            ha! ha!\n\nO! Will you be staying,\nOr will you be flying?\nYour ponies are straying!\nThe daylight is dying!\nTo fly would be folly,\nTo stay would be jolly\n     And listen and hark \n     Till the end of the dark\n        to our tune\n        ha! ha!\n</poem>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Poems in The Hobbit]]\n\n[[Category:Poems in The Hobbit]]\n[[fi:Hoi!
