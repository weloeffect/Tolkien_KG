His people became scattered and declined in number, but poverty and dishonour bred within them a great greed and lust for power. When the Elves of [[Grey Havens|Mithlond]] founded the refuge of [[Edhelion]], in the Blue Mountains, Skorgrím sought to rob them of their relics and treasures. He rallied the remnants of his people and laid siege to Edhelion. Worse yet, he had paid [[Goblins]] and [[Trolls]] to assist him, something of which no honourable Dwarf would conceive. His evil ways brought him to ruin, though Edhelion was also lost.<ref>{{VGC|SAIE}}, \"The Refuge of Edhelion\"</ref>\n\n===Necromancy===\nSix hundred years later Ivar the Blood-Hand, a Gaunt-lord and a vile necromancer from the First Age, summoned a fell spirit which entered the preserved corpse of Skorgrím and raised it as a wight. The dark realm of Angmar used this creature to turn the Dourhands entirely to evil, leading them to believe that the creature was indeed Skorgrím reborn, to lead them to wealth and glory. Now the Dourhands serve [[Angmar]], under the rule of the creature they know as Skorgrím.<ref>{{VGC|SAIE}}, \"Skorgrím's Tomb\"</ref>\n\n===Service to Angmar===\nFor the next two years, Skorgrím remained in Ered Luin, resurfacing when he attempted to ignite a war by hiring goblins to break in and steal Longbeard treasure from [[Thorin's Halls|Thorin's Hall]] and kidnap the Elven-prince Avorthal, framing each transgression on the other side. Thankfully, his deception was uncovered, and the combined forces of [[Dwalin]] and Dorongúr Whitethorn attacked and drove Skorgrím from the valley of Rath Teraig.<ref>{{VGC|SAIE}}, \"Assault on Rath Teraig\"</ref>\n\nSkorgrím fled to [[Bree-land|the Bree-lands]], where he acted in service to the [[Nazgûl]] for some time, before being sent to the [[Misty Mountains]] by the [[Witch-king]].<ref>{{VGC|SAI}}, \"Othrongroth\"</ref>\n\n===Final Destruction===\nThe resurrected \"Skorgrím\" was defeated within the fortress of Gabilazan in the Misty Mountains.<ref>{{VGC|SAV}}, The Last Refuge</ref> The evil spirit's true and final purpose, unbeknownst to all not aligned with the Enemy, was to be sealed into the frozen corpse of the dragon Thorog by Drugoth the Death-Monger. Though initially successful, both Thorog and Drugoth were defeated and the Nazgȗl they served banished back to [[Mordor]], leaving the spirit within the dragon presumably destroyed once and for all.<ref>{{VGC|SAV}}, \"Fire and Ice\"</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Dwarves from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings Online characters]]"}}}
