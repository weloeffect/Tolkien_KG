However, after Cwén died, [[sea-longing]] overcame Ottor, and he left his two young sons, and went sailing again.<ref name=Ott/>\n\nDuring his voyages, he stumbled upon an island inhabited by an old man, who taught him much about the lore of the hidden seas in the [[West]], and who told him of the [[Magic Isles]], and of one very remote island far to the west - that is, [[Tol Eressëa]].

There, he was greeted by [[Lindo]], the lord of the Cottage, and his wife [[Vairë (wife of Lindo)|Vairë]], who offered him shelter at their home.<ref name=Win/>{{rp|14–15}} That night, Lindo and Vairë told him the history of the Cottage of Lost Play,<ref name=Win/>{{rp|18–20}} and of the city of Kortirion.<ref name=Win/>{{rp|16}}\n\nThe following day, Eriol met [[Rúmil (elf of Tirion)#Other versions of the legendarium|Rúmil]], the old door-ward of the Cottage, in his gardens,<ref>{{LT1|II}}, p. 47</ref> where he told Eriol the story of ''[[the Music of the Ainur]]''.<ref>{{LT1|II}}, p. 52</ref> Later that evening, Rúmil also told him the tale of ''[[the Coming of the Valar and the Building of Valinor]]''.<ref>{{LT1|III}}, p. 65</ref>\n\nThat night, Eriol for the second time heard the fluting of [[Tinfang Warble]], a half-[[Fays|fay]], half-elven creature, which caused a great longing in his heart, that only the magic drink, called ''[[limpë]]'' could cure. However, Vairë told him that only the Lady of Tol Eressëa, [[Meril-i-Turinqi]], might give it to him.<ref name=Mer>{{LT1|IV}}, pp. 95-7</ref>\n\n=== Meeting with Meril-i-Turinqi ===\n[[File:Sandrine Gestin - Meril.jpg|thumb|left|''Meril'' by [[:Category:Images by Sandrine Gestin|Sandrine Gestin]]]]\nTherefore, a few days later, [[Littleheart]], one of the inhabitants of the Cottage, led Eriol to the home of Meril, located underneath the [[Tirin na Gilweth|tower of Ingil]] in a ''[[korin]]'' of [[elms]]. There, Eriol requested to taste ''limpë'', seeking kinship and fellowship with the Elves and an end to his longing.<ref name=Mer/>\n\nHowever, Meril denied him, telling him that it was dangerous for a [[mortal]] Man to do so, as [[Ilúvatar]] made his [[Children of Ilúvatar|Children]] different, and drinking ''limpë'' would erase his old desires but awake new ones; she also warned him that he would one day long for his lands again.<ref name=Mer/> To explain better she told him the stories of ''[[the Chaining of Melko]]''<ref>{{LT1|IV}}, p. 98</ref> and of ''[[the Coming of the Elves and the Making of Kôr]]''.<ref>{{LT1|V}}, p. 113</ref>\n\nAfter that, Eriol stayed in the Cottage of Lost Play for some time, hearing the stories of ''[[the Theft of Melko and the Darkening of Valinor]]''<ref>{{LT1|VI}}, p. 140</ref> and of ''[[the Flight of the Noldoli]]''.<ref>{{LT1|VII}}, p. 162</ref>\n\nBefore winter came to Kortirion that year, Eriol also visited many of the homes of the [[Vanyar#Other versions of the legendarium|Teleri]] and the [[Inwir]] (the royal clan of the Teleri), who lived there, and learned more of the language, history and customs of the Elves.<ref name=Vea>{{LT2|I}}, p. 4</ref>\n\n=== Winter in Tol Eressëa<ref group=\"note\">The in-universe chronology of this portion of Eriol's life, as well as the ordering of the tales, is uncertain, since [[Tolkien]] at certain points changed the structure and the order of the ''Lost Tales''.</ref>===\nOne day during the winter, some time after Eriol's visit to Meril, there arrived a guest to the Cottage, and his name was [[Gilfanon]]. He was a very wise and a very old [[Gnomes|Gnome]] who lived at [[Tavrobel]], a village in the west of Tol Eressëa. Since Eriol wanted to know more about the [[Sun]] and the [[Moon]] and their making, Lindo suggested to him that he should travel with Gilfanon to his home, the [[House of the Hundred Chimneys]], for Gilfanon could tell him much of such things.<ref name=Gil>{{LT1|VIII}}, pp. 174-5</ref>\n\nHowever, while Gilfanon agreed that Eriol should visit his home, he ultimately let Lindo tell ''[[the Tale of the Sun and Moon]]'',<ref name=Gil/> after which Vairë told the story of ''[[the Hiding of Valinor]]''.<ref>{{LT1|IX}}, p. 207</ref> The following night, Gilfanon told the story of the ''[[Gilfanon's Tale|Travail of the Noldoli and the coming of Mankind]]''.<ref>{{LT1|X}}, p. 231</ref>\n\nSometime during the winter, one of the children of the Cottage of Lost Play, called [[Vëannë]], asked Eriol to tell her about his own life,<ref name=Vea/> and in return Vëannë told him ''[[the Tale of Tinúviel]]''.<ref name=Win/>\n\nLater, Gilfanon was supposed to tell the story of ''[[Turambar and the Foalókë]]'', but was not present at the [[Tale-fire]] that evening, so instead one [[Eltas]] recounted the tale instead.<ref>{{LT2|II}}, pp. 69-70</ref>\n\nThe next day, Lindo and Vairë sent messengers to Meril, the Lady of Tol Eressëa, inviting her to the Cottage of Lost Play, since they were planning a great festival of tale-telling before Eriol departed for Tavrobel. This was done because Littleheart son of [[Voronwë]] needed aid in the telling of the three final tales, one of them being ''[[the Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|the Fall of Gondolin]]'', which he recounted on the first night of the festival.<ref name=Ear>{{LT2|III}}, pp. 144-5</ref>\n\nThat tale was followed by the tale of ''[[the Nauglafring]]'', which was told by Gilfanon.<ref group=\"note\">Gilfanon was called ''Ailios'' in this and several other texts in the early legendarium.</ref><ref>{{LT2|IV}}, p. 221</ref>\n\nAll of these tales ultimately culminated in ''[[the Tale of Eärendel]]'',<ref>{{LT2|V}}, pp. 252-3</ref> after which Eriol departed for Tavrobel.<ref name=Ear/>\n\n=== Departure to Tavrobel ===\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Taurobel.png|thumb|left|120px|''Taurobel'' by [[J.R.R.

In one earlier version, Eriol died in Tol Eressëa ''before'' the Faring Forth.<ref name=Tav/>\n\n==== ''Epilogue'' ====\nHowever, in another version of events (which Tolkien called the ''[[Epilogue (The Book of Lost Tales)|Epilogue]]''), following the [[Faring Forth]] (the disastrous attempt by the Elves of Tol Eressëa to rescue their [[Ilkorindi|lost kin]] in the East, in which the entire island of Tol Eressëa was dragged across the [[wikipedia:Atlantic Ocean|Ocean]] to be anchored off the coast of the Great Lands), Eriol died some time after the [[Battle of the Heath of the Sky-roof]] in which the invading Men from the Great Lands overran Tol Eressëa.\n\nThere, after fleeing across the rivers [[Afros]] and [[Gruir]] with the remaining Elves of the Lonely Isle following the battle, he wrote down the last words of the ''Golden Book'' in the ruined Tavrobel:<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''8''', pp. 287-9</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|...Hark O my brothers, they shall say, the little trumpets blow; we hear a sound of instruments unimagined small.

Eriol, longing for his home, sailed back to the Great Lands against the command of Meril-i-Turinqi, where he \"preached\" of the Faring Forth before he eventually died. However, his impatience and disobedience hastened the Faring Forth, and ultimately doomed it.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''14''', p. 294</ref>\n\n==== Legacy ====\nEriol's legacy, however, continued in his sons - Hengest, Horsa and Heorrenda - who later conquered Tol Eressëa (which eventually became known as [[wikipedia:England|England]]), and from whom the [[wikipedia:English people|English]] preserved the true tradition of the Elves.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, p. 293</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''Eriol'' is in [[Qenya]], meaning \"One who dreams alone\", possibly being derived from the roots [[ERE]] (\"remain alone\") + [[OLO]] (\"dream\") or [[LORO]] (\"doze, slumber\").<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-290783935.html|articlename=ᴱQ.

In that reimagining of the [[legendarium]], Tol Eressëa ceased to be identified with England/[[wikipedia:British Isles|British Isles]] - instead, it became a different island, and [[wikipedia:Great Britain|Great Britain]] became the island of [[Luthany]], while the mariner that came there was called [[Ælfwine]], an Englishman sailing ''from'' England ''to'' Tol Eressëa.<ref name=Ael>{{LT2|VI}}, pp. 300-1</ref>\n\n=== Later legendarium ===\nIn a somewhat later version of the legendarium, beginning with the c. [[1926]] ''[[Sketch of the Mythology]]'', the name '''''Eriol''''' reappears as an [[Elvish]] name of Ælfwine.<ref name=Ael/>\n\nFor more information, see: ''[[Ælfwine#Other names]]''.\n\n== Inspiration ==\nThe names of Eriol's sons are significant to the historical context of the Eriol story. In British folklore, Hengest and Horsa are the legendary leaders of the Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain in the 5th century AD. By connecting them to the translator of the ''Lost Tales'', Tolkien would have established a direct link between his legendarium and the [[wikipedia:Matter of Britain|Matter of Britain]].<ref name=Ott/>\n\nAs stated previously, Eriol's original name was Ottor. [[Dimitra Fimi]] and [[Andrew Higgins]] propose that Tolkien in his youth perhaps assumed (or was given) an [[Animalic]] name '''Otter''' for himself. In the year [[1909]] he wrote a note in Esperanto ''Privata al LUTTRO'' \"Private to OTTER\".<ref>{{HM|SV}}, pp. 40-1 [note 19]</ref><ref>[[Arden R.
