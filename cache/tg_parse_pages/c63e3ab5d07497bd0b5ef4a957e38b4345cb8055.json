Treebeard had been telling the hobbits of the \"broad days\" in the [[First Age]] when the forests were much more extensive and after a bit of silence began chanting this song as he walked.\n \n==Lyrics==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic;margin-left:20px;\">\nIn the willow-meads of [[Nan-tathren|Tasarinan]] I walked in the Spring.\nAh! the sight and the smell of the Spring in Nan-tasarion!\nAnd I said that was good.\nI wandered in Summer in the elm-woods of [[Ossiriand]].\nAh! the light and the music in the Summer by the Seven Rivers of Ossir!\nAnd I thought that was best.\nTo the beeches of [[Forest of Neldoreth|Neldoreth]] I came in the Autumn.\nAh! the gold and the red and the sighing of leaves in the Autumn in Taur-na-neldor!\nIt was more than my desire.\nTo the pine-trees upon the highland of [[Dorthonion]] I climbed in the Winter.\nAh! the wind and the whiteness and the black branches of Winter upon [[Orod-na-Thôn]]!\nMy voice went up and sang in the sky.\nAnd now all those lands lie under the wave,\nAnd I walk in [[Ambaróna|Ambarona]], in [[Tauremorna]], in [[Aldalómë]],\nIn my own land, in the country of Fangorn,\nWhere the roots are long,\nAnd the years lie thicker than the leaves\nIn Tauremornalómë.\n</poem>\n \nAfter finishing this song Treebeard walked on silently through the silent woods.<ref>{{Cite DTP|id=LR 3.04.077}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Donald Swann]] wrote music for this song, which can be found in the book ''[[The Road Goes Ever On (book)|The Road Goes Ever On]]'';<ref>{{RGEO|Willow}}</ref> it is also found on the accompanying CD of the latest version.\n \n==See also==\n*[[Poems in The Lord of the Rings|Poems in ''The Lord of the Rings'']]\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Poems in The Two Towers]]\n[[Category:Songs]]"}}}
