But \"little Tom Pickthorn from over the Hill\" is also described in \"Homeward Bound\" as a Man who was killed fighting ruffians.\n\n==Men or Hobbits?==\nThe above etymology implies that \"Heathertoes\" was a name given to Hobbits by Men. However in the narrative the name is listed among those used by the [[Men]],<ref>{{FR|I9}}</ref> and [[Mat Heathertoes]], who is named as one of the casualties of Bree during fighting there, is listed among Men rather than Hobbits.<ref>{{RK|VI7}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Bree-men]]\n[[de:Malte Heidezehen]]\n[[fi:Vaiverovarvas]]"}}}
