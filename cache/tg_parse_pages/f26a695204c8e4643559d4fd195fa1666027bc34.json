[[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] objected to the short cut, and mentioned the ''Golden Perch''. One more reason to avoid Stock was in order to keep Pippin away from there and prevent their journey from being delayed.<ref name=short/>{{rp|p. 88}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name possibly represents a modernization of [[Old English]] ''Stoc'' \"place, outlying farm or hamlet\".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=https://tolkienlistsearch.herokuapp.com/message/5e9c35b63ee6a6c41e9862d6|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]|accessed=20 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''\n:In the Game Boy Advance version of [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]], it is possible to visit both Stock and the Golden Perch.\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Stock lies before the [[Brandywine Bridge]], welcoming the travelers to the ''[[The Golden Perch]]'' inn.\n\n{{references|n}}\n[[Category:Cities, towns and villages of the Shire]]\n[[de:Stock]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/villes tours et forteresses/comte/stock]]\n[[fi:Runko]]"}}}
