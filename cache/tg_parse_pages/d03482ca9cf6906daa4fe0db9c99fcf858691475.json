He was killed at the [[Battle of Dagorlad]] and was succeeded by his son, [[Thranduil]]. Thus, he was the grandfather of [[Legolas]], a member of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]].\n\n==History==\n===Early life===\nOropher was one of the [[Iathrim]] who spent his early life in [[Doriath]]. Following the destruction of [[Beleriand]], Oropher would be among the many [[Sindar]] who decided to stay in [[Middle-earth]].<ref name=\"Princes\"/>\n\n===Move to Greenwood the Great===\nAmong the wave of [[Sindar]] who left [[Lindon]] and travelled eastward, before the building of the [[Barad-dûr]] in {{SA|1000}},<ref name=\"AppB\">{{App|B}}</ref> Oropher travelled to [[Greenwood the Great]], and it was in {{SA|750}} that he was taken up by the [[Elves of the Wood]] as their king and founded the [[Woodland Realm]].<ref name=\"Princes\"/><ref name=foundation>{{PM|Second}}</ref>\n\nThe few [[Sindar]] who had come with him were soon merged with the [[Silvan Elves]], adopting their customs and language and taking names of [[Silvan Elvish|Silvan form and style]]. Oropher and his household wished to return to a simple existence natural to the [[Elves]] before they had been disturbed by the [[Valar]].<ref name=\"Princes\"/>\n\nOriginally, Oropher's realm encompassed the south of [[Greenwood]], with dwellings about the hill of [[Amon Lanc]].<ref name=\"Princes\"/><ref name=\"Note 14\"/> However, throughout the [[Second Age]], he migrated north with his people three times.<ref name=\"Note 14\">{{UT|Gladden}}, note 14</ref> According to one tradition, the first movement was northward beyond the [[Gladden Fields]], due to his desire to distance himself from the increasing encroachments of the [[Dwarves of Khazad-dûm]] and his resentment of the intrusions of [[Celeborn]] and [[Galadriel]] in [[Lothlórien]].<ref name=\"Princes\"/>\n\nOropher was also disturbed by the reports of [[Sauron]]'s rising power and by the end of the [[Second Age]], he dwelt in the western glens of the [[Mountains of Mirkwood|Emyn Duir]] and his numerous people lived and roamed in the woods and vales westward as far as [[Anduin]], north of the ancient [[Men-i-Naugrim|Dwarf-Road]].<ref name=\"Note 14\"/>  \n\n===War of the Last Alliance===\nAlthough Oropher's desire was to distance himself and his people from the affairs of the rest of the world, he could see the danger that [[Sauron]] posed, and that his defeat would bring about peace in [[Middle-earth]]. Thus, he joined the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]], summoning a large army which joined with [[Amdír]]'s smaller force of [[Elves of Lórien]] to create a great host of Silvan Elves.<ref name=\"Princes\" />\n\nThe Silvan Elves were strong and brave, but despite having poor armour and weapons in comparison with the [[Noldor]], Amdír and Oropher were unwilling to submit to the supreme command of [[Gil-galad]] and as such they suffered heavy losses in the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. In the very first assault upon [[Mordor]], Oropher and other brave and hasty Silvan Elves rushed forward before Gil-galad gave the signal to charge. Oropher himself was killed soon afterwards, whilst two-thirds of his army perished throughout the course of the war. Upon Sauron's defeat the remnants of the army returned to Greenwood under the command of Oropher's son Thranduil, who succeeded his father to kingship.<ref name=\"Princes\" />\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name '''''Oropher''''' probably means 'tall beech-tree'<ref name=\"EOA\">[http://www.glyphweb.com/arda The Encyclopedia of Arda], \"[http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/o/oropher.html Oropher]\", dated 21 April 2003 (accessed [[13 January|January 13]], [[2011]])</ref> from '''oro''' meaning 'high' and '''fêr''' meaning 'beech'.<ref name=\"Thains\">[http://www.tuckborough.net/ The Thain's Book], \"[http://www.tuckborough.net/elves.html#Oropher Elves of Middle-earth#Oropher]\" (accessed [[13 January|January 13]], [[2011]])</ref> \n\nOropher hailed from [[Doriath]] indicating his name could be [[Sindarin]] ([[Doriathrin]] specifically) but upon merging with the [[Elves of the Wood]], the [[Sindar]] of his household adopted their language and took names of [[Silvan Elvish|Silvan form and style]] so, it seems likely that his name is styled in [[Silvan Elvish]].<ref name=\"Princes\" />\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nThe published [[Appendix B]] of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', as well as one of its drafts,<ref name=foundation>{{PM|Second}}</ref> mention only Oropher's son Thranduil as King of the Woodland realm, founded in {{SA|750}}, suggesting (but not explicitly mentioning) that he was possibly its founder and first king.\n\nOropher was invented later, while Tolkien was fleshing out the background of Thranduil and the history of the Silvan realms, explicitly clarifying that Thranduil was not the founder of the realm. Oropher was not introduced in more \"canonical\" narratives, and the drafts exploring his origins were published in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''.\n\nThe first name of Oropher was ''Rogner'', such as revealed in [[The Nature of Middle-earth]].<ref>{{NM|P3xvii}}, p. 365, n. 8</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| ORO |ORO='''OROPHER'''<br/><small>''d. {{SA|3434}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| |!| |}}\n{{familytree| THR |THR=[[Thranduil]]<br/><small>''Unknown''</small>}}\n{{familytree| |!| |}}\n{{familytree| LEG |LEG=[[Legolas]]<br/><small>''Sailed West {{FoA|120}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Amdír]] (and his son [[Amroth]])\n* [[Elves of Mirkwood]]\n* [[Woodland Realm]]\n\n{{references}}\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n|race=sindar\n|house=\n|born=Before {{FA|507}}\n|died={{SA|3434}}\n}}\n{{seq\n|pvac=None\n|prev=New title\n|list=1st King of the [[Woodland Realm]]\n|dates={{SA|750}} - {{SA|3434|n}}\n|next=[[Thranduil]]\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Moriquendi]]\n[[Category:Rulers in Middle-earth]]\n[[Category:Second Age characters]]\n[[Category:Sindar]]\n[[de:Oropher]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/elfes/teleri/sindar/oropher]]\n[[fi:Oropher]]"}}}
