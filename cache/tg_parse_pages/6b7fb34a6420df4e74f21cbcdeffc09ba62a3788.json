The Drúedain called their own kind [[Drúedain|Drughu]], a name which the [[Elves]] rendered into their own languages and intonations. In [[Sindarin]] it became [[Drû]], from which the name Drúedain has been derived. In Quenya, Drughu became Rú.  When they were recognised by the Elves as belonging to the race of [[Men]], and became their allies in the war against [[Morgoth]], they acquired the suffix [[atani]], so Quenya [[Rúatani]] is exactly equivalent to Sindarin Drúedain.<ref>{{UT|Druedain}}, note 6</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ru}}\n[[Category:Quenya nouns]]"}}}
