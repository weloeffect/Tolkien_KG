The [[Galadhrim]] of [[Lothlórien]] used it to make [[Elven rope|ropes]], which were flexible and light, yet extremely robust.

When Sam tugged the rope in annoyance that they'd have to leave it and it would help Gollum get down, it came loose and fell on him.  Frodo thought Sam had tied it badly, but Sam thought it came because he called it.<ref name=Taming>{{TT|IV1}}</ref>\n\nWhen Frodo and Sam tied their Elven rope around [[Gollum]]'s ankle he screamed in pain.
