The book features cover illustration by [[Angus McBride]] and interior illustration by [[Liz Danforth]] and Kamran Sedaghatkish.\n\n== Back Cover Text == \n\nLike Frodo and the rest of the Fellowship, you too can now venture into Dwarven ruins as ancient as abandoned Moria. But gird up your sword and ready your shield – the darkness filling the mountain hold is fraught with peril.\n\n'''Adventure Lurks Ahead!'''\n\n''\"Over the Misty Mountains Cold\"'' is the second sequel to the ''Lord of the Rings Adventure Game''™. High among the peaks of the mist-shrouded Hithaeglir, you'll discover the tumbled walls of an old Dwarven stronghold. More than fallen stones await you there – a secret from the past, an ally from the West, and foes who hate the sun will all sway your destiny.\n\n'''Its's Fun!'''\n\nAll ''Lord of the Rings Adventure Game'' sequels use the same fun and user-friendly storytelling format you mastered in your first adventure ''\"Dawn Comes Early.\"'' You'll start playing as soon as you turn the title page! ''(Remember, you do need the boxed game to play!)''\n\n'''The Excitement Goes On!'''\n\nLook for the next sequel adventure when you're ready for more fun. ''\"Before the Goblins\"'' starts where ''\"Over the Misty Mountains\"'' ends, continuing the tale of evil deeds done by a power that lurks under Mirkwood's dark eaves.\n\nWhen you're ready for more epic adventuring in J.R.R. Tolkien's world, check your game- or bookstore for the best-selling ''Middle-earth Role Playing''™. It's the perfect next step up!\n\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Game books]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
