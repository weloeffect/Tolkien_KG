In Appendix A I (ii) The Southern Line Heirs of Anárion Hyarmendacil II (Vinyarion) is the King of Gondor before Minardil. In the entry for the 25th king Minardil in manuscript C of The Heirs of Elendil in The Peoples of Middle-earth it is mentioned that Minardil was at Pelargir and suspected no danger since the crushing of Harad and Umbar by his father. In the entry for the 24th king Vinyarion in manuscript C of The Heirs of Elendil in The Peoples of Middle-earth it is mentioned that Vinyarion took the name Hyarmendakil II in 1551 after a great victory over Harad. These two statements in The Heirs of Elendil seem to imply that Minardil was the son of Vinyarion and thus the great-grandson of Eldacar. It is noteworthy that Appendix A I (iv) does not mention king Aldamir and king Hyarmendacil II (Vinyarion), although both are included in the list of Kings of Gondor in Appendix A I (ii) and in the Tale of Years of The Third Age in Appendix B. It is possible that this is the reason why Aldamir and Vinyarion were overlooked in Appendix A I (iv) in the short sentence mentioning king Minardil. In the opinion of Wayne G. Hammond & Christina Scull \"Minardil, son of Eldacar\" was an error and should be changed to \"Minardil, great-grandson of Eldacar\".<ref>{{webcite|author=Wayne G. Hammond & Christina Scull|articleurl=https://www.hammondandscull.com/addenda/rings.html|articlename=Addenda and Corrigenda to the 50th anniversary edition of The Lord of the Rings (2004-5)|website=wayne & christina|accessed=31 October 2021}}</ref> Mark Fisher has the same opinion.<ref>{{webcite|author=Mark Fisher|articleurl=https://www.glyphweb.com/arda/m/minardil.php|articlename=Minardil|website=The Encyclopedia of Arda|accessed=31 October 2021}}</ref>\n\nIn manuscript C it is mentioned that the rebels in Umbar had become much mixed in blood through the admission of Men of Harad and that only their chieftains, the descendants of Kastamir, were of Númenórean race and that the leaders of the Corsairs of Umbar, Angomaite and Sangahyanda made the raid up the river [[Anduin]], ravaged Pelargir and the coasts, killed Minardil and escaped with great booty after the had learned through spies that Minardil was at Pelargir and that he suspected not danger.<ref name=\"Elendil\" /> In the preceeding manuscript B it is mentioned that the sons of Kastamir and other members of his family established a small \"kingdom\" in Umbar and created a fortified haven there and that they married women of the Harad and had lost much of their Númenórean blood in three generations, but had not forgotten their feud with Gondor and had killed Minardil in Pelargir with almost the same description as in manuscript C.<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, Commentary, Minardil</ref>\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien did not mention any intermarriage between the Númenórean rebels in Umbar with the Haradrim in Appendix A, despite mentioning a mingling of the blood of the Dúnedain with that of lesser Men in Gondor itself after the return of Eldacar and that those descendants of the kings, on whom the suspicion of the kings fell, who had not fled to Umbar, had married women who were not of Númenórean blood. In the second edition of The Lord of the Rings he did not reinsert a statement about intermarriage between the Corsairs of Umbar and the Haradrim, but expanded the description of the events during the life of Romendakil II (Minalkar) and Valakar that led up to the Kin-strife.<ref>{{PM|Ai}}, Note on the expansion of the tale of the Kin-strife in the Second Edition</ref> Furthermore, the description of the Kin-strife in manuscript C is shorter than in Appendix A. It did not include that the high men of Gondor looked askance at the Northmen among them, that it was unheard of before that any son of the King should marry a woman of lesser and alien race, that (some of) the Dúnedain feared that the descendants of Vidumavi would be short-lived and fall from the majesty of the Kings of Men and that they were not willing to accept Eldacar as their lord. It also did not include that the sons of Castamir with others of their kin and many people of the fleets held out long at Pelargir, that they gathered all the force at Pelargir that they were able to, that Eldacar did not have ships to besiege Pelargir by sea and that they sailed away with their force to Umbar. This motive of aversion against people perceived as a lesser and alien race, the long stay of the rebels in Pelargir prior to their departure to Umbar, their posession of ships in Pelargir and the lack of ships of Eladacar, which gave them the opportunity to take women with them from the people of Pelargir or to pick up women with ships from the people of the coasts who had supported Castamir in his rebellion could be an indication that the intermarriage with men or women of the Harad in manuscipt C was deliberately abandoned.\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n| race=gondorian\n| house=[[House of Anárion]]<small><br/>Cadet branch of [[House of Elros]]</small>\n| born={{TA|1454}}\n| died={{TA|1634}}\n}}\n{{seq\n| prev=[[Hyarmendacil II]]\n| list=25th [[Kings of Gondor|King of Gondor]]\n| dates={{TA|1621}} - {{TA|1634|m}}\n| next=[[Telemnar]]\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n{{southernline}}\n[[Category:Gondorians]]\n[[Category:House of Anárion]]\n[[Category:Quenya names]]\n[[Category:Rulers of Gondor]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[de:Minardil]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/hommes/3a/dunedain/gondoriens/minardil]]\n[[fi:Minardil]]"}}}
