By the time the [[Great Journey]] began, an unknown number of generations had passed and their numbers were much increased from the original 144. However, the number 144 continued to represent the entire body of the Elven people and the numbers given to reckon the populations of those who chose to embark on the Journey or not are given as proportions of 144.</ref><ref>{{WJ|Quendi}}</ref> All those Elves who never reached Valinor are \"Dark Elves.\" \n\nIn the [[First Age]], the Sindar viewed the term \"Moriquendi\" as offensive, so the Noldorin [[Exiles]] gave the name [[Úmanyar]] (\"Those not of [[Aman]]\") to those who started the journey but did not finish it. This specifically included the Sindar and the [[Laiquendi]], and, broadly, also the other Nandor and their [[Silvan]] and [[Galadhrim]] descendants.\n\nKing [[Thingol]] was a special exception to these categories: he had been to Valinor as an ambassador of the Elves and saw the Light of the Trees, but he did not complete the Journey. As such he was one of the ''Úmanyar'' but not a Dark Elf, and was reckoned among the [[Calaquendi]].<ref>{{S|4}}</ref> Nonetheless, the [[Sons of Fëanor]] called Thingol \"Dark Elf\" as an insult.<ref>{{S|Index}}, entry \"Dark Elves\"</ref>\n\nThe special title \"'''Dark Elf'''\" given to [[Eöl]] of [[Nan Elmoth]] seems to refer to his personal aversion to the light of the [[Sun]] rather than his heritage:\n{{blockquote|But now the trees of Nan Elmoth were the tallest and darkest in all Beleriand, and there the sun never came; and there Eöl dwelt, who was named the Dark Elf.

Later he considered an additional use of the term: \"sometimes applied to Elves captured by [[Morgoth]] and enslaved and then released to do mischief among the Elves.\" He thought that this latter idea should be taken up for Eöl.<ref>{{WJ|III}}</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nIn Norse mythology, there are the [[Light-elves|Light Elves]] (''[[Wikipedia:Light elves|Ljósálfar]]'') and the Dark Elves (''Dökkálfar'' or ''[[Wikipedia:Svartálfar|Svartálfar]]''), a tradition which was well known to [[J.R.R.
