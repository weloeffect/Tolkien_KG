Tolkien]] as one of those who \"read the proofs of my edition and made many corrections and contributions\", and offered solutions \"to many textual and philological problems.\" (p. vi).\n\nA prose translation of the poem, by J.R.R.Tolkien, was published in ''[[The Battle of Maldon: together with The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth]]'' in [[2023]].\n\n==From the inside flap==\n{{blockquote|This is the first edition of ''The Battle of Maldon'' to be taken from the transcript of John Elphinston, which has only recently been identified. The misreadings in Hearne's print, from which all previous editions have been taken, are here eliminated, and an attempt has been made to provide historical background and a literary evaluation of the poem. The broken text and over punctuation of most Old English poems have also been avoided by the editor, and the lines are printed in one, with no extra spacing. The text contains one photograph and a map of the battlefield.}}\n\n==Publication history and gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"125px\" heights=\"125px\">\nFile:The Battle of Maldon 1937.jpg|1937 first edition\nFile:The Battle of Maldon 1963.png|1963 first edition 5th impression\nFile:The Battle of Maldon 1968.jpg|1968 first edition 7th impression\n</gallery>\n* Methuen, hardcover ([[1937]]), pp.&nbsp;98\n** 1937 first edition, 5th? impression ([[1963]])\n** 1937 first edition, 7th? impression ([[1968]])\n\n==External links==\n* [https://archive.org/details/battleofmaldon0000evgo ''The Battle of Maldon''] on Archive.org\n\n{{title|italics}}\n{{Gordonbooks}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Battle of Maldon, The}}\n[[Category:Poetry books]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Publications with contribution by J.R.R.
