It is a collection of several essays.\n\n==From the publisher==\n{{blockquote|The six articles in this collection commemortate the thirtieth anniversary of the long-awaited publication in 1977 of Christopher Tolkien's edition of The Silmarillion, the first opportunity for most readers to learn more about the detailed mythology and history which underlie, explicitly or implicitly, the narrative of The Lord of the Rings. In view of the long and complex publication history of the texts relating to the legendarium, even thirty years is perhaps too short a time to form a critical consensus about the work. Nevertheless, the articles presented here hope to give a picture of some of the areas of investigation that have established themselves in that period: mythopoeia, theology, the legacy of the ancient North, and the ways in which a text is created. The contribution of [[Rhona Beare]] is a completely re-written version of a section from her now [[J.R.R. Tolkien's The Silmarillion|out of print introduction to the Silmarillion]]; the other have all been written specially for the occasion.}}\n==Contents==\n*[[Allan Turner]] — \"Preface\"\n*[[Rhona Beare]] — \"A Mythology for England\"\n*[[Michael Drout]] — \"Reflections on Thirty Years of Reading ''The Silmarillion''\"\n*[[Anna Slack]] — \"Moving Mandos: The Dynamics of Subcreation in 'Of Beren and Luthien'\"\n*[[Michael Devaux]] — \"The Origins of the ''Ainulindalë'': The Present State of Research\"\n*[[Jason Fisher]] — \"From Mythopoeia to Mythography: Tolkien, Lonnrot, and Jerome\"\n*[[Nils Ivar Agøy]] — \"Viewpoints, Audiences and Lost Texts in ''The Silmarillion''\"\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.walking-tree.org/cormareBookInfo.php?number=15 Official product page]\n{{Cormarë}}\n{{title|italics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Silmarillion: Thirty Years On, The}}\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]"}}}
