Their style has been described as \"[[Tolkien metal]]\", because the lyrics of most of their songs deal with [[Middle-earth]]. Their first three albums are named after strongholds of evil: \"[[Lugburz (album)|Lugburz]]\" ([[1995]]), \"[[Minas Morgul (album)|Minas Morgul]]\" ([[1996]]) and \"[[Dol Guldur (album)|Dol Guldur]]\" ([[1996]]).\n\n== Discography ==\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: ; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n|'''Date of Release'''\n|'''Title'''\n|'''Label'''\n|-\n|[[1995]]\n|''[[Lugburz (album)|Lugburz]]''\n|Napalm Records\n|-\n|[[1995]]\n|''[[Minas Morgul (album)|Minas Morgul]]''\n|Napalm Records\n|-\n|[[1996]]\n|''[[Dol Guldur (album)|Dol Guldur]]''\n|Napalm Records\n|-\n|[[1999]]\n|''[[Stronghold]]''\n|Napalm Records\n|-\n|[[2001]]\n|''[[Let Mortal Heroes Sing Your Fame]]''\n|Napalm Records\n|-\n|[[2006]]\n|''[[Oath Bound]]''\n|Napalm Records\n|-\n|[[2013]]\n|''[[Old Mornings Dawn]]''\n|Napalm Records\n|-\n|[[2018]]\n|''[[With Doom We Come]]''\n|Napalm Records\n|-\n|}\n\nThe band has also released the following demos/EPs:\n*[[Nightshade Forests (album)|Nightshade Forests]]([[1997]])\n*[[Lost Tales (album)|Lost Tales]] ([[2003]])\n*Dark Ages I\t\n*Upon The Viking Stallion\n*The Urilia Text\n*Anno Mortiri Domini 1959\n\n== Members ==\n\n* Protector (Richard Lederer)- Vocals, Guitars, Keyboards, Drum programming\n* Silenius (Michael Gregor)- Vocals, Keyboards, Bass\n\n=== Former Members ===\n* Trifixion (Alexander Trondl)-Drums\n* Pazuzu (Raymond Wells)-Vocals\n\n== Musical Characteristics ==\nSummoning is known for their epic-style, Tolkien-related atmospheric black metal style, with emphasis on keyboards.  Their trademark sound is characterized by:\n* Very minimalistic guitars often low in the mix\n*  Programmed and heavily reverberated drums giving a very cavernous feel to the rhythm\n* Multi-layered synthesizer and keyboard melodies mimicking orchestral instruments which often dominates the rest of the mix.\n* Vocals performed in a traditional black metal fashion, however they are often heavily reverberated, giving a very epic and roomy sound to the songs.\n* The band often makes use of audio samples, particularly from the ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' radio play.\n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Songs by Summoning|A list of songs by Summoning]]\n==External links==\n* '''[https://www.facebook.com/SummoningOfficial Official Facebook]'''\n* '''[http://www.summoning.info Official Website]'''\n* '''[http://www.myspace.com/upthehammers Official Myspace]'''\n* {{WP|Summoning (band)}}\n* [http://summoning.yuku.com Sound of Middle-Earth (Official Forum)]\n\n[[Category:Bands]]\n[[Category:Black metal]]\n[[de:Summoning]]\n[[fi:Summoning]]"}}}
