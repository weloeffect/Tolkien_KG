What if [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] weaved his fictional characters into a tapestry created from the secret knowledge of earth's ancient history?\" Is there historical and archaeological evidence that supports this position and was any of this knowledge known to Tolkien?\n\nRecent discoveries in Iraq (ancient Sumer, Babylon), Greece and Finland confirm the possibility that intelligent creatures once lived and worked alongside man. There are clues that point to the fact, that as a race, we were the labor force required to serve superior beings - Gods - to create their vision of heaven on earth. \n\nDiscover the truth about the Sang Real (Royal Blood), Rennes-la-Chateau and the Templar Knights!}}\n\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Religious books]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
