On several occasions, the direct line of descent failed in Gondor, and other members of the house were called on to take up the Kingship. Most notable among these was [[Meneldil]] himself, the first King to rule Gondor in his own right, who took up the throne on the death of his uncle [[Isildur]].\n\nThere are examples of members of the Royal House being granted important military roles. For example, the great [[Gondorians|Gondorian]] general [[Eärnil II|Eärnil]] was a member of the Royal House, being a descendant of [[Telumehtar]], great-grandfather to the reigning King [[Ondoher]]. Indeed, when Ondoher and his heirs were lost, [[Eärnil II|Eärnil]] eventually succeeded to the Kingship himself.\n\nOne important political role, however, was closed to members of the Royal House: that of Steward. When [[Rómendacil I]] created the Stewardship, he specified that no member of the House should ever take the role. The descendants of the [[House of Húrin]], who would eventually take on the hereditary Stewardship of the realm, were noted as being of high [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] blood (they had some share in the actual blood of Elendil and Anarion, and so were ultimately of royal origin<ref>J.R.R. Tolkien, Christopher Tolkien (ed.), The Peoples of Middle-earth, \"VII. The Heirs of Elendil\"</ref>), but they were not members of the Royal House itself.\n\nAt the last years of the Kingship, royal descendants of pure Númenórean blood had become few; several of the last Kings were childless and heirs were chosen from the House, until the death of [[Eärnur]]; no claimant for the throne could be found or whose claim all would accept, and people were afraid of a new [[Kin-strife]] that would devastate the kingdom.<ref name=\"Gondor\">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Denethor|Denethor II]] was about to immolate himself upon a pyre, he proudly told [[Gandalf]] that he was a \"Steward of the House of Anárion\".  By using this name for the head of the royal house of Gondor he was rejecting [[Aragorn]] as a new king, calling the line of [[Isildur]] a \"ragged house long bereft of lordship and dignity\".<ref>{{RK|V7}}</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\nShowing the descendants of Anárion.  All information in the tree is from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Appendix A, \"The Southern Line Heirs of Anárion\",<ref name=\"South\">{{App|South}}</ref> or \"Gondor and the Heirs of Anárion\",<ref name=\"Gondor\"/> or  ''[[The Peoples of Middle-Earth]]'', The Heirs of Elendil<ref name=\"Elendil\">{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> unless otherwise specified.  The figures after the names are those of birth and death where recorded (when only one figure is shown it is marked as either the date of birth, 'b.', or the date of death, 'd.').  A dagger symbol, '†' signifies those who did not die of old age.  A name preceded by '*' indicates one of the Kings of Gondor.  A vertical dashed line indicates a line of descent with some members missing.\n\n===Beginnings===\nNear the end of the [[Second Age]] the High King of the exiled [[Númenóreans]] was [[Elendil]], whose sons [[Isildur]] and Anárion jointly ruled the realm of Gondor.  Elendil and Anárion died in the War of the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] and Isildur died soon thereafter in the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]], which left the crown of Gondor in the hands of Anárion’s son Meneldil.  From this first sole King of Gondor came the House of Anárion, the royal house of Gondor.\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree |boxstyle=white-space:nowrap;| | | |ELE| | | | | |ELE=* [[Elendil]]<br /><small>''SA 3119-3441'' †</small><br/><ref group=\"note1\">Elendil and [[Gil-Galad]] died when they fought and cast down [[Sauron]] during the [[Siege of Barad-dûr]].</ref>}}\n{{familytree | |,|-|-|^|-|-|.| | | |}}\n{{familytree |boxstyle=white-space:nowrap;|ISI| | | |ANA| | |ISI=* [[Isildur]]<br /><small>''SA 3209-TA 2'' †</small><br/><ref group=\"note1\">Isildur was slain at the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]].</ref>|ANA=* [[Anárion]]<br /><small>''SA 3219-3440 †''</small><br/><ref group=\"note1\">Anárion was slain before [[Barad-dûr]].</ref>}}\n{{familytree | |!| | | |,|-|^|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree |boxstyle=white-space:;|HOI| |TOS| |MEN|HOI=''[[House of Isildur]] ''|TOS=Three older<br/>siblings<br/><ref group=\"note1\">It is said that Meneldil was Anárion's fourth child; the other three were not named.</ref>|MEN=* [[Meneldil]]<br /><small>''SA 3318-TA 158''</small><br/><ref group=\"note1\">Meneldil was the last man born in [[Númenor]].</ref>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | |!| |}}\n{{familytree |boxstyle=white-space:nowrap;| | | | | | | | |CEM|CEM=* [[Cemendur (King of Gondor)|Cemendur]]<br/><small>''SA 3399-TA 238''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | |!| |}}\n{{familytree |boxstyle=white-space:nowrap;| | | | | | | | |EAR|EAR=* [[Eärendil (King of Gondor)|Eärendil]]<br/><small>''TA 48-324''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | |!| |}}\n{{familytree |boxstyle=white-space:nowrap;| | | | | | | | |ANR|ANR=* [[Anardil (King of Gondor)|Anardil]]<br/><small>''136-411''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | |!| |}}\n{{familytree |boxstyle=white-space:nowrap;| | | | | | | | |OST|OST=* [[Ostoher]]<br/><small>''222-492''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | |!| |}}\n{{familytree |boxstyle=white-space:nowrap;| | | | | | | | |TAR|TAR=* Tarostar<br/>[[Rómendacil I]]<br/><small>''310-541'' †</small><br/><ref group=\"note1\">Tarostar Rómendacil I was slain fighting fresh hordes of [[Easterlings]].</ref>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | |!| |}}\n{{familytree |boxstyle=white-space:nowrap;| | | | | | | | |TUR|TUR=* [[Turambar (King of Gondor)|Turambar]]<br/><small>''397-667''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | |!| |}}\n{{familytree |boxstyle=white-space:nowrap;| | | | | | | | |ATA|ATA=* [[Atanatar I]]<br/><small>''480-748''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | |!| |}}\n{{familytree |boxstyle=white-space:nowrap;| | | | | | | | |SIR|SIR=* [[Siriondil (King of Gondor)|Siriondil]]<br/><small>''570-830''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n====Beginnings notes====\n<references group=\"note1\"/>\n\n===Ship-Kings and the Noontide of Gondor===\nAfter King Siriondil came the four [[Ship-kings]] of Gondor who extended the realm along the coasts and conquered the [[Umbar|Haven of Umbar]].
