On [[Aragorn]]'s order [[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]], a [[Dúnedain|Dúnadan]], [[Andriel]], an [[Elves|Elf]] loremaster from [[Rivendell]], and [[Farin (video game character)|Farin]], a [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] from [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], infiltrated Fornost to stop the army of Orcs from joining the Nazgûl. When they found the chained Eagle, they helped him to escape.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Main Gate''</ref> When they met with two more infiltrators, [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]], they formed a team to cripple the Orc forces and slay Agandaûr.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Inner Wards''</ref> After they fought a way to the citadel tower Eradan, Andriel and Farin dealt with Tharzog while Elladan and Elrohir confronted Agandaûr. Tharzog was killed but Agandaûr had the upper hand in his battle with the Half-elves. However, when the Half-elves where joined by Eradan, Andriel and Farin, he fled on the back of a [[Fell beast]]. Even though Beleram pursued him in the air, Agandaûr escaped the Eagle's clutches by summoning a thunder storm.<ref name=\"Citadeltower\"/>\n\nIn the aftermath of his retreat from Fornost Agandaûr turns to rallying his forces for his campaign in the North and forging alliances. Therefore, he recruits the renegade Stone-giant Bargrisar to Sauron's cause, using his vile war-bands of Orcs and [[Trolls]] to destroy the nests of the Great Eagles.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 3: Ettenmoors, ''The Coldfells''</ref> Further, he enlists the Spider-Queen Saenathra of [[Mirkwood]] to silence the Wizard [[Radagast]], in order to prevent him from sending messages to the Free Peoples. Both of his plots are foiled, yet Agandaûr resolves to treat with the [[Dragon]] Urgost on behalf of Sauron, offering him the neighboring Dwarven realm of Nordinbad in exchange for joining the Dark Lord's force that assaults the North.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 5: Mirkwood, ''Heart of the Web''</ref>\n\n===Guardians of Middle-earth===\n[[File:Guardians of Middle-earth - Agandaûr Icon.jpg|thumb|Agandaûr in ''[[Guardians of Middle-earth]]'']]\nAgandaûr was a sadistic and bloodthirsty [[Black Númenóreans|Black Númenórean]] whose lust for power bent him to the will of the dark arts, becoming one of [[Sauron]]'s most feared Lieutenants.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHqCol16mBs Guardians of Middle-earth Ori and Agandaûr: Battle Profile Trailer]</ref> In the [[Witch-king]]'s absence, Agandaûr led the Dark Army, spreading fear and destruction in the name of the Dark Lord.
