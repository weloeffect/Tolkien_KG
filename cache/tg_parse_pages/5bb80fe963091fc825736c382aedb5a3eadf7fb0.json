It may interest you to know that (however unfair it may seem) it is impossible to patent mere names, so that you have no obligation to ask my permission, though I appreciate your courtesy.  In the case of Bag-End, I did not invent it, it was in fact the local name of a house an aunt of mine lived in in Worcestershire: an old tumbledown manor house at the end of an untidy lane that led nowhere else.<br/><br/>Yours sincerely,<br/><br/>J.R.R. Tolkien}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Letter to Ken Jackson (4 January 1968)]]\n\n{{references}}\n{{title}}\n[[Category:Letters|Jackson, Ken (1968-01-29)]]"}}}
