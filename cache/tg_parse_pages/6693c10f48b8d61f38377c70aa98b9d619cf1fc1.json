During his time the [[Arkenstone]] was discovered, the most prized possession of the Kingdom. His son, [[Thorin I]], later became [[King under the Mountain]] but after seeing the wealth of the [[Dwarves of the Grey Mountains]], he abandoned Erebor.  \n\nWhen the [[Cold-drakes]] invaded the Grey Mountains, they drove most of the Dwarves out. [[Thrór]], a descendant of Thorin I, took some of his people and flew the Grey Mountains for Erebor. His brother [[Grór]] continued east with a great following of Durin's folk to the [[Iron Hills]] while himself refounded the kingdom of Erebor in {{TA|2590}}.\n\n===Second Kingdom===\nThe Dwarves gained the friendship of the [[Northmen]] along the [[Celduin]] and had much trade of goods, beautiful trinkets, and weapons with the town of [[Dale]]. The Dwarves of Erebor also had much traffic of ores with their kinsmen in the Iron Hills and the region had peace and prosperity for many years.\n[[File:David T. Wenzel - Dwarf-woman.jpg|thumb|left|The Dwarves flee Erebor and Dale]]\nThe Dwarves were properous, and made great wealth for themselves until they were dispossessed of their immense wealth by [[Smaug]] the Dragon, who flew south from the [[Grey Mountains|Ered Mithrin]] and [[Sack of Erebor|sacked]] their kingdom in {{TA|2770}}.  \n\nThe Dwarves reclaimed their inheritance many years later under the leadership of [[Thorin|Thorin II]].  But it was the descendants of [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin II Ironfoot]] that ruled there ever after.\n\n===Third Kingdom===\nAfter the restoration thanks to [[Thorin and Company]], the Dwarves became again rich and prosperous under Dáin's rule, as the Dwarves exceeded their ancestors in masonry and mining. Dale was rebuilt as a kingdom and they had close friendship with the [[Elves of Mirkwood]].<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}</ref>\n\n[[Balin]] and other Dwarves set out to [[Balin's Colony|reclaim Moria]] in {{TA|2989}}. Dáin did not give his blessing and could not dissuade them.<ref name=\"Council\">{{FR|Council}}</ref> It was only later learned that the colony was destroyed after five years.<ref>{{FR|Bridge}}</ref>\n\n===War of the Ring===\nIn {{TA|3018}}, a messenger came from [[Mordor]], enquiring about \"[[Bilbo Baggins|Baggins]]\" from \"[[the Shire|Shire]]\", promising the last three [[Seven Rings|Dwarf-rings]] to Dáin. The King asked time to think and he sent [[Glóin]] and his son [[Gimli]] to [[Elrond]] for council, and to warn Bilbo.<ref name=\"Council\"/>\n\nThe [[War of the Ring]] reached the North; King [[Brand]] fighting the [[Easterlings]] retreated from the River [[Carnen]] and was given aid by Dwarves in the [[Battle of Dale]].  After three days of fighting Dwarves and Men were driven back, and Brand was slain, followed by Dáin.<ref>{{UT|Erebor}}</ref> Several days later the Easterlings learned that the War was lost. When the new King [[Thorin Stonehelm|Thorin III Stonehelm]], son of Dáin, and Brand's [[Bard II]] saw this they came out of the mountain and routed their enemies.<ref name=\"Great\">{{App|Great}}</ref>\n\nLittle is known of the reign of Thorin III, other than the Dwarves helped rebuild the cities of [[Minas Tirith]] and the fortress of [[Helm's Deep]]. Some of the Dwarves colonized the [[Glittering Caves]].\n\n==Language and writing==\nThe Dwarves of Erebor spoke [[Khuzdul]] but used the [[Language of Dale]] for their public names.<ref>{{App|F1}}</ref>\n\nComing from Moria, the Dwarves brought with them the [[Angerthas Moria]], which however was modified further. For some reason some [[runes]] of Angerthas Moria were reverted back to their [[Elvish]] values in [[Angerthas]]. The resulting variation was known as [[Angerthas Erebor]].<ref>{{App|Cirth}}</ref>\n\n==Members==\nNoted Dwarves from Erebor were:\n\n*'''[[Thráin I]]'''\n*'''[[Thorin I]]'''\n*'''[[Thrór]]'''\n*[[Thráin|Thráin II]]\n*[[Thorin]]\n*[[Balin]], [[Dwalin]]\n*[[Dori]], [[Nori]], [[Ori]]\n*[[Óin]], [[Glóin]]\n*[[Bifur]], [[Bofur]], [[Bombur]]\n*[[Kíli]], [[Fíli]]\n*[[Gimli]]\n*[[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin II Ironfoot]]\n*[[Thorin Stonehelm|Thorin III Stonehelm]]\n*[[Floi]], [[Loni]], [[Nali]], [[Frár]]\n*[[Dís]]\n*[[Frerin]]\n*[[Fundin]]\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Dwarven peoples]]\n[[de:Erebor]]\n[[fi:Erebor]]"}}}
