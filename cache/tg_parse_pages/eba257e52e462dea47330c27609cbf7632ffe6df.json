The Keeper of the Dungeons was invented by [[Warner Bros.]] for [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]], where he was portrayed by [[Conan Stevens]].\n\n==History==\nThe Keeper of the Dungeons participated in the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] where he fought [[Dwalin]] and was scarred in the encounter. Years later, during the [[Quest of Erebor]], the Keeper of the Dungeons was summoned by the [[Sauron|Necromancer]] to the fortress of [[Dol Guldur]]. He first spotted [[Gandalf]] hanging in a cage in Dol Guldur. He removed the cage, and then opened it to remove Gandalf. He then started interrogating Gandalf about the [[Three Rings]] for the [[Elves|Elven-kings]], and suddenly spotted [[Narya]] on one of the [[Wizards|Wizard's]] fingers. While attempting to claim it for his master, the Keeper is interrupted by the intruding [[Galadriel]], who blasts the orc to pieces, killing him.\n\n==Other versions==\nUnlike the [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (extended edition)|Extended Edition]], the Three Rings are never mentioned in the theatrical version and the Keeper of the Dungeons never noticed Narya on Gandalf's finger, though he still attempts to kill Gandalf, despite the reason never being mentioned in that version.\n\nThe appearance of the Keeper of the Dungeons was originally intended as an early design of [[Azog]], though the design was later reused for [[Bolg]], and even appeared as such in ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]''.<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://atolkienistperspective.wordpress.com/2013/12/16/azog-bolg-and-yazneg-the-trios-tangled-design-history/|articlename=Azog, Bolg … and Yazneg: The trio’s tangled design history|dated=16 December 2013|accessed=17 June 2017|website=[http://atolkienistperspective.wordpress.com A Tolkienist Perspective]}}</ref> However, that idea was scrapped and the design was later re-purposed again for a third time to be the appearance of the Keeper of the Dungeons.\n\n{{References|Notes}}\n\n[[Category:Orcs from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Hobbit (film series) characters]]"}}}
