It was a snow-clad peak that rose in the inner regions of the mountain range. From its feet sprang the [[Snowbourn]], whose widening valley ran northwards through the mountains to emerge onto the plains of [[Rohan]]. The [[Rohirrim]] called that valley [[Harrowdale]], and built their courts of [[Edoras]] at its mouth, from where the lonely white peak of the Starkhorn could be seen along the straight length of the valley. On a cliff above the valley they found the refuge of [[Dunharrow]] which had been built by [[Pre-Númenóreans|Pre-Númenórean Men]] of the White Mountains.<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nIt means \"horn standing up stiff like a spike\" and represents [[Rohanese]].<ref name=\"Nomen\"/>\n\nAs [[J.R.R.
