Madril was invented by [[Warner Bros.]] for [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]], where he was portrayed by [[John Bach]].\n\n==History==\nMadril was a Ranger of some experience. He helped [[Faramir]] in his ambush of [[Haradrim]] in [[Ithilien]], where they also captured [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]]. After a short stay at [[Henneth Annûn]], the company moved on to [[Osgiliath]] to reinforce its garrison.<ref>{{tttee}}</ref>\n\nDespite initial doubts, the Orcs held off an attack. Madril sent scouts to [[Cair Andros]] to see if there was any enemy activity in the North. However, the Orcs crossed the [[Anduin]] in Osgiliath with boats, and Faramir's men were caught unawares.\n\nThe orcs overpowered the Gondorian troops, and at Madril's advice, Faramir called for a retreat. During the call, Madril was badly wounded. He was left behind in the evacuation. As he lay dying, [[Gothmog (Lieutenant of Morgul)|Gothmog]] stabbed him with a spear, killing him outright.<ref>{{rotkee}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Men from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings (film series) characters]]"}}}
