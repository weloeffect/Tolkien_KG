Tolkien - The Tree of Amalion.jpg|thumb|''The Tree of Amalion'' by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]\n'''Amalion''' was the name of a [[trees|tree]], which [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] regularly drew in illustrations.<ref name=AI>{{HM|AI}}, pp. 64-5</ref><ref>{{PE|16}}, p. 129, n. 1</ref> The name does not appear in any of the stories of the [[legendarium]].\n\n==Etymology==\n[[Carl F. Hostetter]] has suggested that the name ''Amalion'' derives from [[Quenya]] ''amalya'' (\"rich, blessed\"), from ''amal'' (\"riches, blessing, bliss, good fortune\"), related to a later form, ''alam'', with the same meaning, and also ''alam'' (\"[[Elms|elm-tree]]\") as in ''[[The Etymologies]]''.<ref>{{HM|AI}}, p. 67, n. 74</ref>\n\n==Other works==\n[[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] have suggested that Amalion is related to the \"Tree of Tales\" in ''[[On Fairy-Stories]]'' and [[Niggle]]'s Tree in ''[[Leaf by Niggle]]''. A version of the tree was used as cover art for ''[[Tree and Leaf]]''.<ref name=AI/>\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Trees]]\n[[Category:Art by J.R.R. Tolkien]]"}}}
