The book was first issued in a series of 3 booklets for members of [[The Tolkien Society]] in 1990, created to fund a quality present for Miss [[Priscilla Tolkien]] during the 1992 Tolkien Society Conference, celebrating Tolkien's 100th birthday. Like ''[[The Tale of Gondolin]]'', the project was not backed by the [[Tolkien Estate]].\n\nThe book was released in [[2005]]<ref>\"A note from Ruth Lacon\" in ADC Art & Books: catalogue 2009/10, p.30.
