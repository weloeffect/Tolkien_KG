He was the only animal in Bree after Bill Ferny or his allies had opened the stables of ''[[The Prancing Pony]]'', loosing all the mounts.\n\nThe next day, Bill Ferny sold the pony to [[Frodo Baggins]] for twelve [[silver pennies]], which was more than three times its worth.<ref>{{FR|I11}}</ref> This sale proved fortunate for Bill, as [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam Gamgee]] dearly loved him and nursed him back to health.\n\nBill the Pony travelled with [[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]] and the [[Hobbits]] through the leagues of [[Eriador]],<ref>{{FR|I12}}</ref> carrying Frodo at one point on their journey to [[Rivendell]].<ref>{{FR|II3}}</ref> He then accompanied the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], carrying their rations. Outside the [[Doors of Durin|West-gate of Moria]], Bill was released into the wild for his safety and encouraged to make his way back to [[Bree]].<ref>{{FR|II4}}</ref>\n\nOn the homeward journey of the hobbits, Sam was reunited with Bill the Pony at the ''Prancing Pony''.<ref>{{RK|VI7}}</ref>  When the hobbits reached the gate at the bridge across the [[Brandywine]], Bill Ferny threw the keys at [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and was kicked by Bill the Pony as he ran off into the night.<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>  \n\nSam rode Bill when he accompanied [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] on his trip to the [[Grey Havens]].<ref>{{RK|VI9}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Bill the Pony in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings (1978 film) - Bill the Pony.png|[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]\nFile:Gail McIntosh - Bill the Pony.png|''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring - Bill the Pony.png|''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''\nThe Lord of the Rings Online - Bill the Pony.jpg|''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\nChristina Kraus - Bill the Pony.webp|''[[The Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-earth]]''\n</gallery>\n'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''\n:Rather than being released at the [[Doors of Durin|West-gate of Moria]], Bill is instead taken by the [[Watcher in the Water]].\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''\n:A pony accompanies the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] from [[Rivendell]] to the Doors of Durin.
