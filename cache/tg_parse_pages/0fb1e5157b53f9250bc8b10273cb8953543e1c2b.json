The various forms of it in celtics langages do not follow the normal laws of sound-changes which is the kind of thing that attracted Tolkien’s attention.<ref name=medwed>{{HH|Medwed}}, (iv) The Carrock</ref>\n\n''Carrock'' therefore is a [[Wikipedia:List of tautological place names|tautological]] compound of a Celtic word for \"rock\" and the english word \"rock\";<ref name=medwed /> this principle is exemplified also in the names ''[[Chetwood]]'' and ''[[Bree-hill]]''.<ref name=\"N\">{{HM|N}}, entry '''Archet''', p. 765</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n[[J.R.R.
