When Fëanor sailed off without the host of [[Fingolfin]], Maedhros thought that he was planning to return and carry across the others. He expected that the first ship would carry [[Fingon]], his friend. When he learned that in fact, Fëanor planned to abandon them to prevent Fingolfin from following, he was angry and, alone of his brothers, refused to help burn the ships.<ref name=\"Flight\" /> \n\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Maedhros’s Rescue from Thangorodrim.jpg|thumb|left|''Maedhros's rescue from Thangorodrim'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nWhen Fëanor was killed in the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]], Maedhros inherited the claim to the [[King of the Noldor|kingship]] in [[Exile of the Noldor|exile]]. However, there was no time for him to fulfill this claim, as Morgoth sent an embassy, feigning the surrender of a Silmaril. The Oath driving him, Maedhros also feigned to treat with Morgoth, but instead he was captured by Morgoth's embassy. Morgoth held Maedhros captive for around thirty years<ref name=\":0\">{{GA|49-61}}</ref>, hanging him by a steel shackle about the wrist of his right hand from the face of a precipice of [[Thangorodrim]]. In a daring rescue, his cousin Fingon, helped by [[Thorondor]] the King of Eagles, saved him from torment, but he was forced to cut off Maedhros' hand to release him. With the griefs between their houses assuaged, at the [[council in Mithrim]], Maedhros relinquished his claim as High King of the Noldor to [[Fingolfin]], an action his brothers did not approve of.<ref name=\"Return\">{{S|13}}</ref>\n\nSeeing that his brothers were likely to cause feuds with their kinsmen, Maedhros moved them out of [[Hithlum]], and later ruled the lands around the [[Hill of Himring]], which became known as the [[March of Maedhros]]. Allied with Fingolfin, he won the battle of [[Dagor Aglareb]], and, thanks to his daring deeds during the [[Dagor Bragollach]], [[Himring]] stood while many other elven realms fell.<ref name=\"Return\" /> \n\nHearing word of the deeds of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]], he took hope and gathered his brothers and united with other Elven Houses to create the [[Union of Maedhros]], an alliance to lay siege to Morgoth's fortress of [[Angband]]. However, no support came from [[Thingol]] or [[Nargothrond]], due to the deeds of [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]], Maedhros' brothers. The Union and the siege was utterly broken after the defeat in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]. Himring was garrisoned by [[Orcs]]. Maedhros and his brothers lived in [[Ossiriand]], consorting with the [[Laiquendi]].<ref>{{S|20}}</ref>\n\nMaedhros learned that [[Dior]], son of Beren and Lúthien, had inherited the Silmaril that they had recovered from Morgoth. Still driven by the Oath, he was convinced by his brother [[Celegorm]] to attack Doriath. Celegorm, [[Caranthir]], and Curufin were slain by Dior Eluchíl, the King of Doriath, who was in turn slain by them. Dior's sons, [[Eluréd]] and [[Elurín]], were captured and abandoned by Celegorm's servants in the forest, leading Maedhros to search for the innocent youths, but to no avail. After learning that [[Elwing]], Dior's daughter, had survived, he and his surviving brothers descended with an army upon the remnants of the people of Doriath living in the [[Havens of Sirion]]. The Noldorin princes killed many Elves and captured Elwing's sons [[Elrond]] and [[Elros]] in the sack, but Elwing escaped with the Silmaril, jumping off a cliff and into the ocean.<ref>{{S|22}}</ref>\n\t\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Maedhros Casts Himself into a Chasm.jpg|thumb|''Maedhros casts himself into a chasm'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nAfter the [[War of Wrath]], he and his last surviving brother, [[Maglor]], stole the two remaining Silmarils taken by the [[Valar]] from Morgoth. But because of the evil deeds committed by the brothers to regain the jewels, they burned the hands of Maglor and Maedhros. Unable to bear the suffering, Maedhros cast himself and the Silmaril he carried into a fiery chasm in the Earth.<ref>{{S|24}}</ref> It is uncertain whether he was eventually released from [[Mandos]], or whether he still remains there with his father till the [[Dagor Dagorath|End of the World]].\n\n==Etymology==\n''Maedhros'' is [[Sindarin]], a compound of ''maed'' (\"shapely\") + ''ross'' (\"red-haired\"), which are [[Sindarized]] elements of his names '''''Mai'''timo'' and '''''Russ'''andol'' (both explained below).<ref name=\"Notes\">{{PM|XINotes}}, p. 366</ref> Thus this name would be properly spelled ''Maedros''.<ref name=\"Feanor\">{{PM|Feanor}}, pp. 352-353</ref>\n\nIn the earlier [[Noldorin]] phase of the language, the name ''Maidhros''/''Maedhros'' is said to mean \"Pale-glitter\".
