''Loëndë'' was the day that fell in the middle of the year in many of the calendars of [[Middle-earth]].\n\n== Uses in different calendars ==\nSince Mid-year's Day in the [[Shire Calendar]] was intended to correspond with the [[wikipedia:Solstice|summer solstice]], then this should apply to ''loëndë'' in the [[Kings' Reckoning]] and [[Stewards' Reckoning]] calendars of [[Gondor]] as well. \nThe Númenórean calendar, every fourth year except the end of the century, loëndë was replaced with two ''[[Enderi]]''<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Appendix D]], \"The Calendars\"</ref>\n\nIn the [[New Reckoning]], ''loëndë'' was the second of the ''Enderi'' and corresponded with [[24 September]] in the Shire Calendar.\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Loëndë'' is a compound of ''[[endë]]'' “middle” and the suffixal form ''-re'' of ''[[ré]]'' “day”. The direct translation of ''Loëndë'' is middle day but it is more often translated as Mid-year's Day.{{Fact}}{{seealso|Mid-year's Day}}\n\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Loende}}\n[[Category:Elven days]]\n[[Category:Quenya nouns]]\n[[fi:Loëndë]]"}}}
