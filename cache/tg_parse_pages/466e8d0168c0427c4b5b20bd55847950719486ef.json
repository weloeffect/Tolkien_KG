It was taken following his [[Speech of Fëanor|great speech]] urging the Noldor to leave Aman and return to [[Middle-earth]].\n\n==History==\nFëanor and his Sons swore in the name of [[Ilúvatar]] that they would not rest until the three [[Silmarils]] were in their hands, and to make war on any who withheld them. \n\nAt the time the Oath was sworn, [[Morgoth]] held all three of the Silmarils, having stolen them from Fëanor's stronghold at [[Formenos]]. Driven by the unbreakable Oath, Fëanor led the greater part of the [[Noldor]] out of [[Aman]] and back to [[Middle-earth]], in hopeless pursuit of the [[Dark Lord]]. Fëanor himself was mortally wounded by [[Balrogs]] in the Noldor's first assault. From that time on, while Morgoth held the three Silmarils in his [[Iron Crown]], the [[Elves of Beleriand]] were bound by a common enemy.\n\nThe true danger of the Oath was revealed after [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] recovered one of the three Silmarils from the depths of [[Angband]]. Thereupon, the Sons of Fëanor made war upon the other Elves of Beleriand for the recovery of the Jewel. They attacked and destroyed the kingdom of [[Doriath]], killing [[Thingol]]'s Heir [[Dior]]. When the Silmaril escaped them there, they discovered that it was held at the [[Mouths of Sirion]] by Dior's daughter [[Elwing]]; again they attacked, and again the Silmaril escaped them. Carried out to sea by the power of [[Ulmo]], Elwing brought it to her husband [[Eärendil]], and they sailed with it back into the West.\n\nThat Silmaril was lost to Fëanor's sons, but two more remained on Morgoth's Crown. After the [[War of Wrath]] and Morgoth's defeat at the end of the [[First Age]], just two of the original oath-takers survived, Fëanor's eldest sons [[Maedhros]] and [[Maglor]]. The former put forth a plan that the latter reluctantly accepted.  They stole the Silmarils from the camp of the victorious host, but because of the evils they had committed in recovering them, they found that they could no longer touch the holy Jewels without enduring searing pain. In despair, Maedhros threw himself and his Silmaril into the depths of the Earth, while Maglor cast his into the deep ocean. Maglor was the last of the oath-takers, and was said to wander the shores of the world lamenting his pain and loss.\n\n==The Oath==\n[[File:Jenny Dolfen - The Oath of Feanor.jpg|thumb|250px|''The Oath of Feanor'' by [[Jenny Dolfen]]]]\n\n{{blockquote|Be he foe or friend, be he foul or clean,<br />\nbrood of Morgoth or bright Vala,<br />\nElda or Maia or Aftercomer,<br />\nMan yet unborn upon Middle-earth,<br />\nneither law, nor love, nor league of swords,<br />\ndread nor danger, not Doom itself,<br />\nshall defend him from Fëanor, and Fëanor's kin,<br />\nwhoso hideth or hoardeth, or in hand taketh,<br />\nfinding keepeth or afar casteth<br />\na Silmaril.
