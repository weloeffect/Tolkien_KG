The Little Kingdom may have existed \"after the days of [[Wikipedia:Coel Hen|King Coel]], but before [[King Arthur|Arthur]] or the [[Wikipedia:Heptarchy|Seven Kingdoms]] of the English\", therefore roughly in the 5th century.<ref group=note>King Coel is stated to have flourished in the 4th century, while Arthur in the 6th.</ref> It was the realm of the legendary King Ægidius Draconarius, who started out in life as [[Farmer Giles]] of [[Ham]]. \n\nThe realm was separated from [[Augustus Bonifacius]]'s earlier [[Middle Kingdom]]. Due to the tamed dragon [[Chrysophylax]] that Giles had in Ham, Augustus Bonifacius was unable to prevent the separation of Giles' realm from the Middle Kingdom.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]''</ref> \n\nAccording to the translator of the story, ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'', the boundaries of the Little Kingdom are difficult to determine from the scanty evidence. The events of the legend seem to have taken place in the valley of the Thames, with an excursion north-west to the walls of Wales. The kingdom apparently never reached far up the Thames into the West, nor beyond Otmoor to the North, and its eastern borders are dubious. Its capital was evidently in its south-east corner, though its confines are unknown.<ref name=fw>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'', Foreword</ref>\n\nA fragmentary legend indicates that [[Georgius]], son of [[Farmer Giles|Giles]] and his page [[Suovetaurilius]] (Suet) had an outpost against the [[Middle Kingdom]] that was maintained at [[Farthingho]].<ref name=fw/>\n{{references|n}}\n\n[[Category:Farmer Giles of Ham]]\n[[fi:Pieni valtakunta]]"}}}
