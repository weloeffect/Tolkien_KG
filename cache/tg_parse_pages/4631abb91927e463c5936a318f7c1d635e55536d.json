After some miles the right-hand wall ended and then the path was between a cliff and a chasm.  This gently sloped section ended at a new rock wall where the Winding Stair began.\n\nThe Winding Stair did not delve into the mountains of the [[Ephel Dúath]]; instead the cliff-face sloped back and the stairway snaked to and from across it.  At one point one of the turns overlooked the vast ravine at the head of Morgul Valley.  The stair still writhed on from this point until it came to a final flight, short and straight.  Beyond the stair was a cleft through which the path led to Cirith Ungol.<ref name=\"Stairs\">{{TT|IV8}}</ref>\n\n[[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] followed [[Gollum]] up the Winding Stair on [[12 March]], {{TA|3019}}.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> After reaching the top of this second set of stairs the two hobbits sat in a crevice and had a bite to eat before facing [[Shelob's Lair|the tunnel]] ahead.<ref name=\"Stairs\"/>\n\n== Portrayal in adaptations ==\n'''2019: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Winding Stair provides a good look at the Dead City below and leads directly into [[Shelob's Lair]] - \"Torech Ungol\".\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Mordor]]\n[[Category:Roads and streets]]\n[[de:Gewundene Treppe]]\n[[fi:Käyrät portaat]]"}}}
