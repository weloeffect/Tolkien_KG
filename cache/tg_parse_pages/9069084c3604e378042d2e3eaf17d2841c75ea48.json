This scene was not featured in the theatrical release of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Gollum]] continues to lead [[Frodo]] and [[Sam]] towards [[Mordor]]. Frodo voices his concerns to Sam that he may not come back from this journey, which Sam dismisses as \"morbid thinking\", saying that they are going ''there and back again'', just like [[Bilbo]] did. \n\nThe three come across the statue of a king, defiled and decapitated, its head replaced by a large boulder. As they walk past the stone head on the ground, the sun briefly comes out, illuminating the king's head, crowned with flowers lit up in the sunlight. \n{{blockquote|Mr Frodo, look! The King has got a crown again.|Sam}}\n\nThe moment passes as clouds cover the sun again, and Gollum urges them to continue. \n\n==Differences==\nThe second half of this scene is very closely aligned with the book. The statue of the king resembles that which Frodo and Sam encounter in the chapter [[Journey to the Cross-Roads]]. In the glow of the [[Sun]], Frodo sees \"a huge sitting figure, still and solemn as the great stone kings of [[Argonath]]... Its head was gone, and in its place was set in mockery a round rough-hewn stone\". A minor difference is that, in the source material, it is Frodo who notices the king's head and says ''\"Look! The king has got a crown again!\"'' to Sam.<ref name=\"TT Journey p. 702\">{{TT|Journey}}, p. 702</ref>\n\n==Notes==\nIn the book, the king's crown is described as being \"a coronal of silver and gold\".<ref name=\"TT Journey p. 702\"/> This is the name of the piece of music from ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King - The Complete Recordings]]'' which plays over this scene. \n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King scenes|13]]"}}}
