The region beyond the Circles is then the place where [[Ilúvatar]] dwells (presumably with those of the [[Ainur]] who did not descend into [[Arda]]). [[Maedhros]] fears that because of the [[Oath of Fëanor]], they may no longer be able to \"reach to Ilúvatar beyond the Circles of the World\".<ref>{{S|24}}</ref>\n\nIt is the fate of [[Men]] to pass out of the Circles of the World after death. [[Aragorn]] refers to the Circles of the World to [[Arwen|Arwen Undómiel]] at his death, saying that they were not bound forever to the Circles of the World, and would meet again.<ref>{{App|A1v}}</ref> A similar phrase occurs in the story of [[Beren|Beren Erchamion]] and [[Lúthien|Lúthien Tinúviel]], where it is said their paths \"led together beyond the confines of the world\".<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>\n\nThe Númenóreans, led by [[Ar-Pharazôn]], went to war with the Valar, expecting to obtain \"everlasting life within the Circles of the World\".<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>\n\nFurther to the [[Downfall of Númenor]], the term apparently took a more narrow meaning. After the [[Changing of the World]], and the taking away of Aman, the lands of the [[Uttermost West]] are said to be no longer within the Circles of the World, though they are clearly still part of the World in some sense. After this point, it seems that the Circles of the World are simply the boundaries of the Mortal Lands of [[Middle-earth]]. Notably, the choice is eventually offered to the children of Elrond, either to become mortal or \"to pass with him from the circle of the world\".<ref>{{App|A1i}}</ref> More generally, Elves, leaving Middle-earth, are said to \"dwell now beyond the circles of the world\".<ref>{{App|F2}}</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\n\n[[Jason Fisher]] identifies possible sources for this phrase in the Norse ''kringla heimsins'' (\"circle of the world\" in the ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heimskringla Heimskringla]''), the Latin ''orbis terrarum'' (notably found in the Vulgate, and particularly in the Book of Wisdom), and the design of medieval T-O maps such as the ''mappa mundi'' of Hereford (where the circular world-map is surrounded by the letters M, O, R and S, spelling out \"death\" in Latin).<ref>[[Jason Fisher]], \"Sourcing Tolkien’s “Circles of the World”: Speculations on the ''Heimskringla'', the Latin Vulgate Bible, and the Hereford Mappa Mundi\" in ''[[Middle-earth and Beyond|Middle-earth and Beyond: Essays on the World of J.
