In live performances bassist John Paul Jones, who plays the mandolin on this track, sang along with Plant.\n\nIt is commonly believed to be based on events in ''[[The Return of the King]]''. \n\nIn the most common interpretation, the Prince of Peace, who \"embraced the gloom\" and \"walked the night alone\", refers to Frodo, who left the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] and left for [[Mordor]] with only his servant and friend [[Samwise Gamgee]] for company. \"The Queen of Light\" who \"took her bow\" is taken to refer to [[Galadriel]], a queen of the Elves, signifying that the [[Third Age]] is ending and that the [[Fourth Age|Age of Men]] will begin soon.\n\nOther interpretations of how the lyrics relate to Tolkien exist: one example has the \"Prince of Peace\" referring to [[Aragorn]].  Probably the song's most compelling link to Tolkien is the reference to \"Ringwraiths,\" a Tolkien invention. \n\n==External links==\n* [http://groups.msn.com/ZeppelinTriviaandmore/lyricswhatdo.msnw?action=get_message&mview=0&ID_Message=507&LastModified=4675317152761229038 A Middle-earth interpretation on The Battle of Evermore]\n\n[[Category:Songs (real-world)]]"}}}
