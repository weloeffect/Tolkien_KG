It would later be followed by ''[[Beyond the Movie: The Return of the King]]''.\n\n==Back Cover==\nThe ultimate companion to the Hollywood blockbuster. National Geographic embarks on an extraordinary journey through myth, legend, language, and history to explore how the imaginary world of Middle-earth reflects our own. Who was [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], and how did he create the amazing world of [[Middle-earth]]? How does the struggle between good and evil in this epic story parallel challenges in our world? Why are the places, heroes, and villains of Middle-earth eerily familiar? Who are the real-life Frodos of today?\n\nFeaturing exclusive footage from [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]], insightful interviews with the cast and filmmakers, and provocative perspectives of explorers, anthropologists, and archaeologists. Only National Geographic can present such a unique look into the blockbuster film and the real-life story behind it. \n\n==Interviewed people==\n* [[Sean Astin]]\n* [[Cate Blanchett]]\n* [[Orlando Bloom]]\n* [[Billy Boyd]]\n* [[Philippa Boyens]]\n* [[Jane Chance]]\n* [[John Garth]]\n* [[John Howe]]\n* [[Peter Jackson]]\n* [[Alan Lee]]\n* [[Christopher Lee]]\n* [[Ian McKellen]]\n* [[Dominic Monaghan]]\n* [[Tom Shippey]]\n* [[Richard Taylor]]\n* [[Liv Tyler]]\n* [[Rayner Unwin]]\n* [[Elijah Wood]]\n==External links==\n* [http://www.nationalgeographic.com/ngbeyond/ NGC product page]\n* [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0312999/ IMDb profile]\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Documentaries]]"}}}
