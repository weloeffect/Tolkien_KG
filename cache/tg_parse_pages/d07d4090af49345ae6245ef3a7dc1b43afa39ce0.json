It appeared as it were of linked golden leaves.\n\n==History==\nBefore the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Company of the Ring]] left [[Lothlórien]], each of its members was presented with a gift by [[Galadriel]]. Boromir was given a belt of gold which he carried in the journey until the [[Breaking of the Fellowship]].<ref>{{FR|II8}}, p. 375</ref>\n\nWhen [[Aragorn]], [[Gimli]] and [[Legolas]] laid him in his burial boat, the golden belt gleamed about his waist.<ref>{{TT|III1}}, p. 416</ref>\n\nLater on, [[Faramir]] one night saw the boat by [[Anduin]] and Boromir lay there dead, and the belt was the only thing he did not recognize. [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] said to Faramir that the belt was given to him in Lórien, and thus positively identified the dead man as Boromir.<ref>{{TT|IV5}}, p. 666</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:Boromir's Belt.jpg|thumb]]\nIn [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]] ([[2001]]), Boromir is the only member of the [[Fellowship]] who does not receive a gift from [[Galadriel]]. He does wear a belt throughout the film, but it is made of leather, not gold. It is possible [[Peter Jackson]] wished to convey the mistrust that Galadriel and the rest of the group felt toward him.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://www.cbr.com/lord-rings-why-boromir-did-not-get-gift-films-explained/|articlename=''Why Didn’t Boromir Get a Gift From Galadriel in the Films?''|dated=29 November 2021|website=[https://www.cbr.com/ ''CBR.com'']|accessed=28 July 2022}}</ref>\n\n{{Giftsofgaladriel}}\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Gifts of Galadriel]]\n[[fi:Vyöt#Boromirin vyö]]"}}}
