Tyler]], first published in [[1976]]. As it was published before ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', this first edition contained numerous errors that were partly corrected in later editions.\n\nIt was revised and enlarged in [[1979]], published as '''The New Tolkien Companion''', incorporating information from ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', and again in [[2002]] as '''The Complete Tolkien Companion''', incorporating also selected information from ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' and ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''. In [[2000]], a reprint of the first edition was released under the original title. Newer editions were released in [[2012]] and in September [[2022]].\n\nUnlike [[Robert Foster]]'s ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', this book does not provide references to its entries.\n\n==From the Publisher==\n{{blockquote|\nBetween [[1932]] and [[1953]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Professor John Ronald Reuel Tolkien]], of [[Oxford]], England, translated four volumes compiled by the renowned [[Hobbits]] [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] and [[Frodo Baggins]], written during the [[Third Age]] of [[Middle-earth|Middle Earth]] ''(sic)'', far longer ago than the [[Celtic]], Germanic and Icelandic manuscripts Professor Tolkien was used to deciphering. The result was ''[[The Hobbit]]'', and readers have never been the same since.\n\nIn [[1954]], seventeen years after The Hobbit first appeared, its sequel, ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' was published, and it became the centerpiece of Tolkien's work. The Ring Epic covers approximately ten thousand years, and contains a vast amount of information as well as a huge variety of words and names which Tolkien translated from the [[Elvish]] and [[Mannish]] tongues. ''The Tolkien Companion'' is an impressive endeavor to guide one through the world of Middle Earth ''(sic)'', compiling every fact, name, word, and date from all the works into one comprehensive and accessible volume.\n\nHere, in one source, is the High History of the Elven peoples. The origins of [[Morgoth]] the Enemy is clarified, as is his Fall, and the subsequent rise to power of [[Sauron]] the Great, Lord of the Rings. The heroic epic of how the [[Free peoples]] -- [[Elves]], [[Men]], [[Ents]], [[Dwarves]], and [[Hobbits]]—survived against the Peril of the Ancient World is meticulously detailed. And a guide to the various Elvish writing systems, together with explanatory maps, charts, even genealogical tables, bring the remarkable genius of Tolkien and the unforgettable world and wonder of Middle Earth to life with focus and accuracy. Presented in alphabetical order for quick and easy reference, ''The Tolkien Companion'' is an indispensable accompaniment for anyone who embarks on the reading journey of a lifetime.}}\n\n==Publishers==\nIn the United Kingdom the various editions were first published by Pan Books, and in the United States by St. Martin's Press (with the ''Complete'' Companion under St. Martin's \"Thomas Dunne Books\" imprint).\nThe first St. Martin's edition was published without indicating an ISBN, the ''New'' with ISBN 0-312-57066-X, and the ''Complete'' with ISBN 0-312-31545-7.\nDespite being issued after,and its Foreword citing, the entire ''History of Middle-Earth'' series, the early printings at least of the Thomas Dunne Books ''Complete Tolkien Companion'' have only a 1976 copyright date.\n\n\n{{title|italic}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tolkien Companion}}\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Reference books]]"}}}
