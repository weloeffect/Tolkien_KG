This was the capital city of [[Rohan]], built on a hill in [[Harrowdale]], a valley of the [[White Mountains]]. There they told the guards that they had come back to return the horses that [[Éomer]] had lent them.\n\nThe four companions entered the city and were guided up to the top of the hill, where the great golden hall [[Meduseld]] stood, home to [[Théoden|King Théoden]]. There [[Háma]], Doorward of Théoden, bid them to lay aside their weapons before being permitted to enter, Aragorn was reluctant to set aside [[Andúril]] but was compelled to do so or not enter. The others did so willingly, leaving their weapons outside the entrance to the hall, with only Gandalf retaining his staff, having deceived the Doorward Hama into it only being a stick to support him.\n\nThe companions entered and found it to be a mighty hall, with carved pillars, rune covered floors and rich tapestries lining the walls, in particular one of [[Eorl the Young]] riding [[Felaróf]] at the [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant]]. However despite the warmth of the hall they did not get a warm welcome from Théoden, who was reluctant to show gratitude; he said this was because Gandalf always brought bad news and so he named him [[Lathspell]]. In truth, [[Saruman]] had a secret hold on Théoden in the form of the advisor, [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]].\n\nGandalf managed to show Théoden that there was still hope and so freed him from his despair and the wicked influence of Wormtongue. Gandalf asked Théoden to release Éomer, who had been held prisoner at the counsel of Wormtongue. When Éomer returned he offered [[Gúthwinë|his sword]] to the King, pledging his service to him once more. Háma was sent to find Théoden's own sword [[Herugrim]], which turned out to be hidden in Wormtongue's locked chest.\n\nThéoden realised his mistake in trusting Wormtongue and decided that he would lead the riders of [[Rohan]] against [[Saruman]]. Wormtongue was given a choice; ride with them to war to prove his loyalty to Théoden in battle, or to go where he wishes, though he will receive no mercy should he be found. He chose to spit at the feet of the king and flee the city.\n\nThéoden then praised Gandalf and granted him [[Shadowfax]] as a gift, no longer to borrow. Gandalf then spoke to Théoden of the depth of Saruman's tracheary, and they made plans to ride to [[Isengard]] and make war against him. He proclaimed that [[Éowyn]] was to rule in his stead until he returned and then leading the host of [[Rohirrim]] alongside Gandalf they rode off into the West towards Isengard.\n\n==Appearances==\n \n{| rules=\"all\" style=\"border:1px solid darkgrey; border-collapse:collapse\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"100%\"\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:gray; color:white; text-align:center\" | '''Notable Appearances'''\n|-\n| style=\"background:lightgrey; text-align:center\" | '''Characters'''\n| style=\"background:lightgrey; text-align:center\" | '''Locations'''\n| style=\"background:lightgrey; text-align:center\" | '''Other'''\n|-\n|\n*[[Aragorn]]\n*[[Gandalf]]\n*[[Legolas]]\n*[[Gimli]]\n*[[Háma]]\n*[[Théoden]]\n*[[Éowyn]]\n*[[Grima Wormtongue]]\n*[[Éomer]]\n|\n*[[Rohan]]\n*[[Emyn Muil]]\n*[[White Mountains]]\n*[[Edoras]]\n*[[Meduseld]]\n*[[Entwash]]\n*[[Barrowfield]]\n|\n*[[simbelmynë]]\n*[[Eorl the Young]]\n*[[Felaróf]]\n*[[Herugrim]]\n|-\n|}\n\n==Composition==\nThe chapter was probably completed by the early summer of [[1942]].<ref>{{CG|CG}}, p. xxiv</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n* See [[The King of the Golden Hall (scene)]]\n\n==External links ==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SFwdcT4QOs The King of the Golden Hall track] from [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers (2003) film]]\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:King of the Golden Hall}}\n[[fi:Kultaisen kartanon kuningas (TSH)]]\n[[Category:The Two Towers chapters]]"}}}
