However, there he grew prideful due to the adoration of the Dwarves and [[Men]] owing to his skills as a craftsman.\n\nTherefore, he never returned to Aulë, but rather set up on his own - and he grew famous, but as the [[Elves]] faded so did his own power and fame, yet he never became wicked.\n\nAges later, the mariner [[Eriol]] asked [[Rúmil (elf of Tirion)#Other versions of the legendarium|Rúmil]], an Elf of [[Tol Eressëa]], if the person of [[wikipedia:Wayland the Smith|Wéland]] (a renowned smith in the Germanic legends) is the same as Aulë, but Rúmil corrected him, saying rather that ''Wéland'' is actually Velindo.<ref name=\"Veli\">{{PE|15}}, \"[[Early Runic Documents]]\", ''ER1d: Fourth page'', p. 96</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''Velindo'' is in [[Qenya]], with '''''Gwilion'''''<ref name=\"Veli\"/> being its [[Gnomish]] equivalent - however, their meaning is unclear.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2905375421.html|articlename=ᴱQ.

However, Fëanor killed Niðad's sons<ref group=note>In the original text, Fëanor killed Melko's \"captain of orcs\", instead of Niðad's sons.</ref> and managed to escape by crafting artificial wings for himself; he also made love to the king's daughter [[Beaduhilde]] and fled with her, but ultimately lost her in woods.\n\nEventually Beaduhilde (who was now pregnant) forgave Fëanor, and in spite of her father's wrath at her pregnancy, she still managed to obtain Niðad's blessing upon her son.<ref name=Fea>{{PE|15}}, \"[[Early Runic Documents]]\", ''ER1f: Sixth and seventh pages'', p. 97</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Fëanor#Other versions of the legendarium|Fëanor]]\n\n== External links ==\n*\"[https://scholar.valpo.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1381&context=journaloftolkienresearch Skilled Smiths and Princes of Elves: The Wayland-legend and the First Age of Middle-earth]\" by Lillian Hammen in the second issue of Volume 9 of the Journel of Tolkien Research\n\n{{references|notes}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Fays]]\n[[Category:Qenya names]]\n[[Category:Smiths]]"}}}
