Tolkien]] and [[Edith Tolkien]]. He was the literary executor of the [[Tolkien Estate]] until his resignation in [[2017]], and he edited much of his father's work for posthumous publication.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.tolkien.co.uk/Non-Fiction/Pages/History-of-Middle-earth.aspx?page=2&sdt=1&sort=pno&objsct=History%20of%20Middle-earth|articlename=History of Middle-earth|dated=|website=[http://www.tolkien.co.uk Tolkien.co.uk]|accessed=18-11-2012}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n{{sources}}\n===Early life===\nChristopher Tolkien was named after his father's friend, [[Christopher Wiseman]]<ref>{{L|306}}</ref> (he also sometimes used his confirmation name, \"John\" as seen on his initials of maps of [[The Lord of the Rings]], \"CJRT\"). \n\nBorn in [[Leeds]] and raised in [[Oxford]], Christopher went to the Dragon School in Oxford and Oratory School in Caversham, Berkshire. He enjoyed watching stars with a telescope as well as a passion for railways. As early as age four and five, Christopher was concerned with the consistency of ''[[The Hobbit]]''.\n{{Blockquote|[O]n one occasion I interrupted: 'Last time, you said Bilbo's front door was blue, and you said Thorin had a golden tassel on his hood, but you've just said that Bilbo's front door was green and that Thorin's hood was silver'; at which point my father muttered 'Damn the boy,' and then 'strode across the room' to his desk to make a note.|Christopher Tolkien, foreword to The Hobbit}}\n\nChristopher proved invaluable in correcting ''The Hobbit'' after its publication and was paid twopence a correction.\n\nIn [[1937]] he was with his elder brother [[Michael Tolkien|Michael]] at [[The Oratory School]].<ref>{{L|16}}</ref> However, due to a heart ailment he was forced to stay at home and work with a private tutor. After spending [[1938|a year]] with heart-specialists, on the turn of [[1939]], Christopher wanted to go to school.<ref>{{L|35}}, p. 42</ref>\n\n===Young adulthood===\nIn July of [[1943]] he entered the Royal Air Force and in November of that year he went to South Africa to train as a pilot. His absence did not however slow his contributions to his father's works as his father continually sent him parts of ''The Lord of the Rings'' to go over. In [[1945]] he returned to England and was stationed in Shropshire and later that year he returned to Oxford. \n\nOn October 9, [[1945]] his father informed him that the [[Inklings]] wished to consider him a permanent member. The task of reading ''The Lord of the Rings'' to the Inklings was passed on to Christopher and it was generally agreed that he was a better reader than his father.\n\nIn 1954-55 Christopher was delegated the re-drawing of his father's ''Lord of the Rings'' maps for publication.\n\n===Adulthood===\nIn [[1946]] Christopher returned to Trinity College to resume his studies and reading English. For a while his tutor was [[C.S. Lewis]]. His thesis was a translation of ''[[Wikipedia:Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks|The Saga of King Heidrek the Wise]]'' and he received his B.A. in [[1949]]. Christopher also became a lecturer in Old and Middle English as well as Old Icelandic at Oxford. He worked as an editor on Chaucer's ''Canterbury Tales,'' the ''Pardoner's Tale'', and the ''Nun's Priest's Tale''. From [[1963]] to [[1975]] he was a Fellow of New College, Oxford but resigned when he began to devote his time to his father's literary affairs, and soon afterward moved with his family to southern France.\n\n===After his father's death===\nIn [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s last will and testament, Christopher was appointed literary executor and granted  ''\"full power to publish, edit, alter, rewrite, or complete any work of [his father's] which may be unpublished at [his] death or to destroy the whole or any part or parts of any such unpublished works\"''.<ref>[https://www.tolkienguide.com/guide/letters/474?filter=needswork J.R.R. Tolkien's last will and testament] on [[Tolkien Collector's Guide|TolkienGuide.com]] (accessed 29 July 2023)</ref> He embarked on the task of organizing the masses of his father's notes for subsequent publication; something he would continue to do for the remainder of his life. Much of the material was handwritten, frequently a fair draft was written over a half-erased first draft, and names of characters routinely changed between the beginning and end of the same draft. Deciphering this was an arduous task, and perhaps only someone with personal experience of J.R.R. and the evolution of his stories could have made any sense of it; even so, Christopher has admitted to having to occasionally guess at what his father intended.\n\nWith the help of [[Guy Gavriel Kay]] he managed to compile ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' in only four years. During this time, he also edited his father's translations of ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'', and ''[[Sir Orfeo]]''. He also worked on the ''[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings|Nomenclature of The Lord of the Rings]]'', which was first published in [[1975]] as ''[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings]]'' in ''[[A Tolkien Compass]]''.\n\nChristopher spent the years after continuing to study his father's works and taking the responsibilities of the [[Tolkien Estate]]. He recorded portions of ''The Silmarillion'' in [[1977]] and [[1978]] which was issued by Caedmon Records, New York. In [[1979]] he wrote about his father's illustrations and drawings for their publication in Tolkien calendars and ''[[Pictures by J.R.R. Tolkien]]''. Through [[1980]] and [[1983]] Christopher edited ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', ''[[The Monsters and the Critics|The Monsters and the Critics and Other Essays]]'', and ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]'' which was the first volume in his twelve volume series of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', the last of which was published in [[1996]]. In 1998 he edited a new edition of ''[[Tree and Leaf]]'' including the poem [[Mythopoeia]]. In [[2007]], he edited ''[[The Children of Húrin]]'', the first of the so called ''Great Tales'' of Middle-earth. His last publications were the editing of ''[[Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary ]]'' ([[2014]]), ''[[Beren and Lúthien]]'' ([[2017]]) and ''[[The Fall of Gondolin]]'' ([[2018]]).\n\nIn 2016, Christopher Tolkien was awarded the [[Wikipedia:Bodley Medal|Bodley Medal]], the [[Wikipedia:Bodleian Libraries|Bodleian Libraries]]' highest honour, for his \"''editorial work on his father's manuscripts''\" and his \"''academic career at the [[University of Oxford]]''\".<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/news/2016/nov-03|articlename=Editor and Scholar Christopher Tolkien awarded Bodley Medal|dated=3 November 2016|website=[http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/ bodleian.ox.ac.uk]|accessed=6 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn August [[2017]], Christopher Tolkien resigned from his appointment as director of the Tolkien Estate.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07842430/officers|articlename=The Tolkien Estate Limited, Officers|dated=|website=[http://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/ Companies House] |accessed=14 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://tolkienbrasil.com/noticias/sobre-livros/christopher-tolkien-resignou-a-direcao-da-tolkien-estate/|articlename= Christopher Tolkien deixa Tolkien Estate|dated=|website=[http://tolkienbrasil.com/ Tolkien Brasil]|accessed=15 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nHe died on [[16 January]], [[2020]] in [[wikipedia:Draguignan|Draguignan]], France.<ref>{{webcite|author=Laurent Amalric avec e.e.|articleurl=http://www.varmatin.com/culture/christopher-le-fils-de-jrr-tolkien-sest-eteint-dans-le-var-a-lage-de-95-ans-448318|articlename=Christopher, le fils de J.R.R.

As a result, he never approved the idea of the adaptations of any works of his father that Tolkien Estate hold the copyright at any form, such as [[The Silmarillion]] or [[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]].\n\n==Family==\nChristopher's first wife, [[Faith Tolkien|Faith]] (1928) took an English degree at Oxford and they had one son, [[Simon Tolkien]]. A [[:File:J.R.R. Tolkien's bust at Exeter.jpg|bust]] of Tolkien by Faith was exhibited at the Royal Academy: Tolkien paid for its casting in bronze. It is now in the English Library in Oxford.\n\nChristopher's second wife, [[Baillie Tolkien|Baillie]] (1941) is Canadian, and is the daughter of Winnipeg surgeon [[Alan Klass]], and Helen Klass (née Jacob). She has a BA in English from the University of Manitoba and an MA from Oxford. She worked as J.R.R. Tolkien's secretary and was responsible for the section on poetry in the 1965 index to ''The Lord of the Rings''. She later edited ''[[The Father Christmas Letters]]''. She and Christopher have two children, [[Adam Tolkien]] and [[Rachel Tolkien]].\n\n==Portrayal==\nHe appears briefly in the biographical drama film [[Tolkien (film)|Tolkien]], portrayed by actor Jack Riley.\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Books===\n*195?: ''Tolkien Hervarar Saga ok Heidreks Konungs''.
