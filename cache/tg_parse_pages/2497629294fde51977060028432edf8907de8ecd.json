It may have been as old as the East-West Road, which possibly dated to the [[First Age]] or or it may have been built or improved by the [[Númenóreans]] in the [[Second Age]].<ref name=UTNote6>{{UT|7a}}, note 6</ref> In the [[Third Age]], the bridge was within the bounds of the realm of [[Arnor]],<ref name=\"FRmap\"/> and then on the border of two of its three successor realms, [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]],<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, p. 1039</ref> and probably these two realms kept up the maintenance of this strategic structure.\n\nIn {{TA|2941}},<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2941, p. 1089</ref> [[Thorin and Company]] passed over the bridge on their way to the [[Lonely Mountain]]. After the crossing one of the ponies bolted back into the river and its load of food was lost. This loss of provisions and the dwarves' inability to ignite a fire in the wind and rain led to the encounter of [[Bilbo Baggins]] and his companions with the unfriendly trio of trolls.<ref name=\"Mutton\"/>\n\nOn [[11 October]] {{TA|3018}},<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3018, October 11, p. 1092</ref> three [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] were guarding the bridge against [[Aragorn]] and the hobbits on their journey to Rivendell. Their plan was foiled by [[Glorfindel]], who drove them away and left his token,<ref name=Mitheithel/> a green beryl, on the Bridge. Two days later,<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3018, October 13, p. 1092</ref> Aragorn found the beryl, took it as a sign that the bridge was safe, and led the hobbits over it.<ref name=\"Flight\"/>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn the 1960 abandoned rewrite of ''[[The Hobbit]],'' the Last Bridge was more prominent in the story. When the Company came to the bridge they found its single arch broken ([[J.R.R. Tolkien]] had forgotten in this draft that the bridge had three arches in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' - see above). The company had to cross the dangerous ford instead. [[Gandalf]] (not yet vanished as in the published story) tried the crossing first on his horse [[Rohald]]. His success led to the dwarves crossing, followed by Bilbo, although one of the pack-ponies still bolted back into the river.<ref>{{HH|NC2}}, pp. 795-6</ref>\n\nThe 1960 rewrite ended in the next chapter just as the Company came to the edge of the valley of [[Rivendell]]. In a note regarding contents yet to write it was stated \"Ch. III should make clear [[Elrond]]'s care for roads etc. from Greyflood to <Mountains>\".<ref>{{HH|NC3}}, p. 803</ref> This would explain how the Last Bridge got fixed before [[Frodo Baggins]] arrived and found the structure intact.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' video game]]''':\n:While the Last Bridge is absent from the home console and PC versions, it is featured in the GBA version. In addition to the bridge itself, there is also a small, populated village built on the western end. It is here that Frodo's Morgul-wound is treated by a local healer instead of by Elrond in Rivendell.\n\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Last Bridge.jpg|thumb|250px|The Last Bridge in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]']]\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''':\n:The Last Bridge marks the border between the [[Lone-lands]] and the [[Trollshaws]] regions of the game.\n\n{{references}}\n{{companyroute}}\n[[Category:Bridges]]\n[[de:Letzte Brücke]]\n[[fi:Viimeinen silta]]"}}}
