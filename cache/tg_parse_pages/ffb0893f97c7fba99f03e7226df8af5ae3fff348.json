This implies that he was young during the [[War of the Dwarves and Dragons]], or else not even alive at the time. However, he, like many others would hear of the wealth and splendour of [[Erebor]]. Hearing about the wealth of the [[Dwarves of Erebor]], Smaug flew south \"''like a hurricane coming from the North''\" and attacked the wealthy [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] kingdom of the [[Lonely Mountain]] and its adjacent lands: he first landed upon the mountain before going down the slopes and setting the woods on fire. When the [[dwarves]] came running out of the front gate Smaug killed them all before turning his attention to the men of [[Dale]], also killing most of their warriors including [[Girion]], [[Lord of Dale]] (but his wife and child safely fled to [[Lake-town]]<ref name=\"H14\"/>). Returning to the mountain, he crawled into the [[Front Gate|front gate]] and left no dwarf he found alive.\n\nOnly [[Thrór]], [[King under the Mountain]], and his son [[Thráin|Thráin II]] managed to escape by using the [[Back Door|secret side-door]] (Thrór later gave the key to the secret door and [[Thrór's Map|a map]] of the Lonely Mountain to Thráin), while [[Thorin|Thorin Oakenshield]] was one of the few dwarves who were not inside the mountain at the time of the Attack. Smaug claimed the treasure (which included the [[Arkenstone]] and a [[Mithril-coat]]) for himself and laid there upon a bed of gold, for the next two centuries only occasionally leaving the mountain to carry away people (especially maidens) and continue the destruction of Dale.<ref name=\"AppA3\"/><ref name=\"H1\"/> The area surrounding the mountain became known as the [[Desolation of the Dragon]] as \"''there was neither bush nor tree, and only broken and blackened stumps to speak of ones long vanished''\".<ref name=\"H11\"/>\n\n=== Quest for Erebor ===\n{{Seealso|The Hobbit#Synopsis|l1=The Hobbit}}\n[[File:Henning Janssen - Magnificent Guardian.jpg|thumb|left|''Magnificient Guardian'' by [[Henning Janssen]]]]\nIn {{TA|2850}}, [[Gandalf]], whilst spying on the [[Necromancer]] in [[Dol Guldur]], found a Dwarf imprisoned; near death, the dwarf gave Gandalf a key and a map. Unbeknownst to Gandalf at the time, this dwarf was [[Thráin]], [[Kings of Durin's Folk|King of Durin's Folk]], who had been captured by the Necromancer in {{TA|2845}}. Having discovered that the Necromancer was indeed [[Sauron]], Gandalf was very concerned about the Weakened State of the North, but he was most concerned about Sauron and Smaug. He knew that if Sauron could win Smaug's allegiance, Sauron could use him to terrible effect. It is for this reason that the Grey Pilgrim sought a plan to neutralise the threat of the Dragon, thus simultaneously depriving the [[Dark Lord]] of a potential minion and limit his growing power in the northern lands of Middle-earth.<ref name=\"UTErebor\"/> \n\nBy chance on [[15 March]] {{TA|2941|n}}, Gandalf met [[Thorin|Thorin Oakenshield]] in [[Bree]] (although another source states that they met when Thorin overtook but started to talk to Gandalf on the road<ref name=\"UTErebor\">{{UT|9}}</ref>). They discussed their desire to destroy Smaug and retake the Lonely Mountain; they later met in [[Thorin's Halls]] in the [[Blue Mountains]] to develop a plan. Gandalf wanted Thorin to take the [[hobbits|hobbit]] [[Bilbo Baggins]] as a ''burglar'' on their adventure to retake Erebor; this took considerable persuasion.<ref name=\"AppA3\"/><ref name=\"AppB2\"/>\n\nLater in {{TA|2941}}, at the home of [[Bilbo Baggins]], Gandalf presented Thorin with the map and key, and accompanied them on part of [[Quest of Erebor|their quest]].<ref name=H1/> The party reached the mountain later that year on [[Durin's Day]].<ref name=\"H11\">{{H|11}}</ref> They sent Bilbo in through the secret door to carry out his duty as their burglar; as Smaug lay dreaming of greed and violence, Bilbo stole a heavy two-handed cup from the dragon's vast hoard of treasure (which he used as a bed) and went back to the dwarves. Meanwhile Smaug had an uneasy dream:\n\n{{Blockquote|a warrior, altogether insignificant in size but provided with a bitter sword and great courage, figured most unpleasantly|Narrator<ref name=\"H12\"/><ref group=\"note\">[[John D. Rateliff]] has suggested that this was initially written when Tolkien planned for Bilbo to kill Smaug. It was thus a prophetic dream of his own death. See {{HH|Conversations}}.</ref>}} \n\nUpon awaking Smaug felt the draught from the tunnel which led to the secret door (from which he had previously heard untoward knocking). Already suspicious, Smaug noticed that the cup was missing. This enraged Smaug beyond measure, causing him to leave his chamber and scour the mountainside for the intruder, even though he had no real use for the cup; remembering hearing strange noises from the passageway he failed to find the entrance, only eating their ponies.<ref name=\"H12\"/>\n\nRemembering a saying of [[Bungo Baggins|his father]]'s, \"''every worm has a weak spot''\", Bilbo offered to return to the dragon's lair - the Dwarves ardently accepted and, putting on [[the One Ring|the ring]], off he went. Bilbo believed that the dragon was fast asleep and that his presence would remain unknown to the dragon, however, Smaug was pretending to be asleep. He then spoke to Bilbo:\n\n{{Blockquote|Well thief! I smell you and I feel your air. I hear your breath. Come along! Help yourself again, there is plenty and to spare!|Smaug to [[Bilbo Baggins]].}}\n\n[[File:David Wyatt - Smaug.jpg|thumb|right|''Smaug'' by [[David Wyatt]]]]\nBut Bilbo was more shrewd than Smaug gave him credit: Bilbo praised the dragon and made sure that he did not reveal his real name, speaking only in [[Riddle-game|riddles]]. Smaug could not resist the fascination of what Bilbo had said (although he did remind him that flattery would not save his life) and needed to understand it, so they continued to talk; he was also intrigued to smell something new being puzzled by the never-before-encountered \"hobbit-smell\". Bilbo grew more and more uncomfortable in the presence of Smaug, but plucking up courage he revealed that he had not come for the treasure alone: Smaug laughed and mocked the notion that anyone could steal from him and get away with it. Bilbo eventually revealed the true purpose of his mission to Smaug, that of \"''revenge''\" -  Smaug burst into a devastating laughter, shaking Bilbo to the floor, mocking the suggestion that anyone could achieve revenge, boasting about his achievements and strengths. Bilbo then suggested that dragon's were softer underneath, particularly in the chest: in response, and in an act of sheer vanity, Smaug rolled over and claimed that Bilbo's information was false and outdated. But Bilbo, while loudly praising Smaug's jewel-encrusted underside, saw something crucial, thinking:\n\n{{Blockquote|Old fool! Why there is a large patch in the hollow of his left breast as bare as a snail out of its shell!|Bilbo, to himself.}}\n\nBilbo had obtained the information that he had needed. He fled up the passage, leaving behind a dragon infuriated by the notion of \"revenge\", and had the hair on the back of his head and heels singed off. When Bilbo returned to the door-step he regaled the dwarves with the story of his conversation with the dragon whilst the [[Thrushes|thrush]] was listening. Smaug left his lair once more and smashed the mountainside with strikes of his tail, trapping [[Thorin and Company]] inside the secret passage.<ref name=\"HInsider\" />\n\n=== Death and aftermath ===\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Death of Smaug.jpg|thumb|right|''Death of Smaug'' by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]\n\nRealizing that the [[Lake-men]] of [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]] must have helped the intruders - reinforced by Bilbo calling himself the \"''Barrel-rider'',\" Smaug resolved to attack and destroy the town as a punitive measure. He approached it in a rage. The waters around it turned red but Smaug dared not get too close as the water would quench his fire; as the Lake-men had cut the bridges, Smaug flew above attacking and setting the town aflame, destroying the [[Great House]] with a swipe of his tail. The dragon's scales were impervious to the arrows of the defenders, but the thrush had flown to the town and informed [[Bard]] - a descendant of [[Girion]], [[Lord of Dale]] - of the bare spot in Smaug's armour. He was then able to kill Smaug by firing the [[Black Arrow]] directly into the vulnerable spot of his left breast. As Smaug fell he crashed into and destroyed Esgaroth.<ref name=\"H14\"/>\n\nAfter Smaug's death, [[Thorin and Company]] claimed the treasure as theirs by birthright. This created a conflict with Bard and the [[Thranduil|Elvenking]] of [[Mirkwood]], who each wanted a portion of the treasure as reimbursement for huge damage that Smaug had inflicted upon them. Thorin refused to share the treasure and had every intention of going to war with the [[Elves of Mirkwood]] and men of Esgaroth to defend his right to the treasure. However the sudden attack by the armies of [[Bolg]] brought the forces of the [[free peoples]] of Middle-earth together in the [[Battle of Five Armies]].<ref name=\"H15\"/><ref name=\"H16\">{{H|16}}</ref><ref name=\"H17\">{{H|17}}</ref> After the Battle, Bilbo's fourteenth-share of the hoard was given over to Bard who sent some to Lake-town to aid its rebuilding.<ref name=\"H18\">{{H|18}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the death of Smaug a new Lake-town was built further north; Smaug's bones could be seen from the shore but the people were always fearful of it and no one dared go in the water to retrieve the gems or gold, showing that even in Death, Smaug still had a fearful presence.<ref name=\"H14\"/>\n\n== Personality ==\n{{Blockquote|I kill where I wish and none dare resist.

During a meeting of the Wise, [[Gandalf]] reveals his concern regarding a potential alliance between Sauron and Smaug, as a a \"dragon could be used to terrible effect\". [[Saruman]] dismisses this, stating that Sauron had been vanquished. The film ends with a glimpse of the [[Dragons|Dragon]]'s eye as he wakes, though he is buried under the treasure. In addition, movie Smaug was over 140 metres (462 feet) in length, or “twice the size of a 747”.\n\n'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''\n:The Dragon makes his full appearance in the second part and is voiced by [[Benedict Cumberbatch]].<ref name=\"PJCasting\"></ref> [[Thrain]] confirms Gandalf's fears of Smaug being in league with the unseen [[Dark Lord|Dark Power]] in [[Dol Guldur]], later revealed to be Sauron.

It is also observed by Bilbo that the [[Lake-men]]'s legend of [[Girion]] having loosened and removed a scale from the Dragon's breast was in fact true. When the [[Dwarves]] enter the mountain, Smaug chases them, finally catching up to them in the forges, where the Dwarves stage a counterattack, tricking Smaug into relighting the forges with his fire. They manage to cover Smaug in hot molten gold, but he sheds it off without difficulty. Smaug leaves them and flies off to [[Lake-town]] to seek revenge for what he perceives to be their part in Bilbo and the Dwarves' attack.\n\n'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''\n:After destroying the majority of Lake-town, Smaug sees [[Bard]] attempting to take him on.

Smaug survived the destruction of [[Angband]] at the end of the [[First Age]] and settled at Anvilmount in the [[Grey Mountains]]. Here he found and defiled a First Age Adan holy place, destroying tombs and stealing a modest amount of treasure. Smaug was upset by his lack of wealth. Therefore when he heard the tale of the Dwarves of Erebor he knew that the great treasure should be his.

Both of them slept in the cavern called Glimmerdeep in the [[Grey Mountains]] until Etterfang was disturbed by dwarves and fled into the deeper Caverns of Thrumfall; Smaug was unable to find her again when he awoke. It is revealed that a servant of the Dark Lord provoked his rage by slaying many young drakes and placing their heads at the front of the Dragon's lair alongside dwarven weapons. This, coupled with greed, caused Smaug to attack the Erebor, which was part of Sauron's design. Following this, the Dark Lord sent emissaries to win him the Dragon's allegiance; when none returned, Sauron tasked Karazgar, a [[Black Númenórean]] agent, with daunting Smaug into submission. Cowed through fear, the Dragon promised to give an answer to the Dark Lord's offer in fifty years. The Quest for Erebor, put in motion by Gandalf, deprived Sauron of Smaug's potential fealty, as the latter was slain before he could be summoned to [[Mordor]]. \n\n:Smaug does not make a physical appearance, but his bones are still found around the watery ruins of the old [[Lake-town]] (known as Esgaroth-of-old).
