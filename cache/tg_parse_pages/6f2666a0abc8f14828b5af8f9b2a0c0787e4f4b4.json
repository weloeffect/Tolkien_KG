When the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] came to the river they could hear it splashing over a waterfall on their right.  There used to be a [[Bridge of Nimrodel|bridge]] but it had long ago disappeared.  It was said that the water of the stream was \"''healing to the weary''\". After passing through [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], the Fellowship crossed and stopped by the Nimrodel to rest.<ref>{{FR|II6}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''\n:Nimrodel is a stream of 25 miles.<ref>{{ICE|4002}}</ref>\n\n'''1995-8: ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]'':'''\n:With the Resource Event ''Healing of Nimrodel'', players can heal their characters.\n\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Nimrodel (river).jpg|thumb|250px|left|The Falls of Nimrodel in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2009: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The river originates at [[Zirakzigil]] and is known as \"Labam-gairu\" to the Dwarves.
