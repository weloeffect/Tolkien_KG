He was the son of [[Handir]] and [[Beldis]] and was named after his mother’s brother.<ref>{{WJ|West}}, ''Commentary, (iii) The Haladin'', p. 237</ref> Brandir became a leader of his people despite his deformity, yet he became ensnared by the doom of [[Túrin]] and died by his sword unjustly.\n\n==History==\nBrandir suffered some accident in his childhood that resulted in a broken leg and left him lame thereafter. Due to his mishap and because of his gentle mood he was never a man of war, taking delight instead in all things that grew in the earth.<ref name=\"Brethil\">{{CH|13}}</ref> Yet after his father died Brandir inherited the chieftainship of the [[Men of Brethil]] and thus was their lord when Túrin arrived in {{FA|496}}.<ref>{{GA|291}}</ref> In order to protect his people, Brandir sought silence and secrecy, far from the other fights of [[Beleriand]].<ref name=\"Brethil\"/>\n\nTúrin was brought into [[Ephel Brandir]] upon a bier carried by the woodmen that he had saved from an [[Orcs|Orc]] attack. He had swooned upon seeing the mound where the woodmen had buried the dead [[Finduilas]] and when Brandir looked upon Túrin a shadow darkened his heart. However Brandir tended to Túrin in his house until he cast off his darkness. Although Túrin determined to renounce his past and took on the new name of [[Turambar]], he still hunted Orcs with other woodmen, against Brandir's policy to protect his people.<ref name=\"Brethil\"/>\n\nBrandir's healing skills were needed again when Túrin brought in a feverish young woman that he and a party of woodmen had found while out seeking Orcs. Since she had been unable to speak and had been weeping they called her [[Níniel]]. Although Brandir healed her and fell in love with her, her heart was given to Turambar. In {{FA|497|n}} Túrin asked Níniel to marry him but Brandir counselled her to wait because of the fear in his heart regarding Túrin. Seeking to dissuade her, Brandir revealed Túrin's lineage to her, being the son of [[Húrin]]. Níniel did put off the marriage due to the words of Brandir (which did not please Túrin), but did marry Túrin at mid-summer of the [[First Age 498|following year]].<ref>{{CH|15}}</ref>\n\nBy the third year of Túrin's abiding at Ephel Brandir he had become the ''de facto'' leader of the Men of Brethil; Brandir went unheeded. Túrin led the woodmen in many battles against the Orcs, yet these deeds drew the dread dragon [[Glaurung]] from ruined [[Nargothrond]], who crawled in a straight path towards Brethil. When Túrin asked for volunteers to go with him to meet the dragon, [[Dorlas]] came forth. Seeing the others hold back, Dorlas chided them and asked if none would take the place of Brandir so that the [[House of Haleth]] would not be put to shame. Thus Brandir, long unheeded, was subjected to scorn and became bitter at heart.\n\nAfter Túrin, Dorlas, and Hunthor had gone, Níniel decided that she had to follow her husband. Ignoring Brandir's plea that she wait, Níniel led a great company of the woodmen to [[Nen Girith]] to seek tidings of the three hunters' fate. Unable to endure the scorn and disdain that had been heaped upon him, Brandir renounced his lordship and people. Yet still he loved Níniel and so, taking up his crutch and a short sword, he hobbled after the throng.<ref>{{CH|16}}</ref>\n\nBrandir caught up with Níniel at Nen Girith where she had been stricken upon hearing the far-off voice of Glaurung. Brandir attempted to lead her away to safety but she sped away to seek Túrin. Again Brandir was forced to limp after her as best he could. Again he caught up with her but too late, for by then Glaurung had revealed to Níniel that she was in truth [[Niënor]], sister of Túrin, and that she carried her brother's child in her belly. Brandir heard Glaurung's words and was so stricken that he leaned against a tree. For a third time Níniel ran with Brandir calling after her but this time he could not catch up, for Niënor cast herself into the waters of [[Cabed-en-Aras]]. Brandir was the last man to peer into its darkness and he turned away in horror.\n\nLimping back to [[Nen Girith]], Brandir encountered Dorlas, who had quailed at crossing the [[Teiglin]]. Realizing that Dorlas' cowardice had contributed to Níniel's death, Brandir proclaimed his hatred for Dorlas. Dorlas tried to strike Brandir but died when Brandir hewed him with his sword. Brandir then hobbled on to bring the tidings to the people of Brethil still gathered at Nen Girith.<ref>{{CH|17}}</ref>\n\nBrandir had thought Túrin dead, and thus was amazed when he appeared before the gathering. Brandir then told Túrin that his wife was dead and revealed that she had been his sister. In wrath Túrin called Brandir \"Club-foot\" and slandered him, and then drew the black sword [[Gurthang]] and slew him. However, Túrin soon met [[Mablung]] the Hunter who confirmed Brandir's words. Túrin ran and asked his sword if it would slay him swiftly. Gurthang replied that it would, to forget the blood of [[Beleg]], killed by accident, and Brandir, killed unjustly.<ref>{{CH|18}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Brandir.mp3|Ardamir}}\nIn ''[[The Etymologies]]'', the name ''Brandir'' is said to be a compound of ''[[brand (word)#Exilic Noldorin|brand]]'' + ''[[dîr]]'', meaning \"Noble Man\".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, pp. 351, 354, entries \"[[BARAT#Other versions of the legendarium|BARÁD]]\" and \"[[DER]]\"</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | HLD | | | | | | |HLD=[[Haldan]]}}\n{{familytree | |!| | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | HMR | | | | | | |HMR=[[Halmir]]}}\n{{familytree | |!| | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | HDR |y| GLO | | |HDR=[[Haldir (Chieftain of the Haladin)|Haldir]]|GLO=[[Glóredhel]]}}\n{{familytree | | | |!| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | HAN |y| BEL |HAN=[[Handir]]|BEL=[[Beldis]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |!| | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | BRA | | |BRA='''BRANDIR<br/>THE LAME'''}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]'', \"[[Turambar and the Foalókë]]\", the lame woodman who would come to love Níniel was called '''''Tamar Lamefoot'''''. He was the eldest son of the leader of the woodmen, [[Bethos]], and an Elf-maiden of the [[Noldoli]], making him [[Half-elven]]. Tamar, who was paid little attention to, grew to love Níniel, but in vain.<ref>{{LT2|II}}, p. 101</ref> It was Tamar who followed Níniel after the defeat of [[Glorund]], and who watched as Glorund revealed her identity to her. He continued after her when she fled, and saw her cast herself into the stream. Grieved, he returned to the people, and declared that Turambar was dead, and Níniel, who was in truth [[Nienóri]] the sister of Turambar, had cast herself into the stream and perished. But Turambar, who was not dead as had been thought, came back among the people. Upon hearing Tamar's proclamation that Níniel was Nienóri, Turambar thought him a liar, and slew him.<ref>{{LT2|II}}, pp. 109-111</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Quenta]]'', Brandir's lameness was attributed to being wounded by an Orc-arrow as a child. He was also noted as uncomely and of less might than many; and for those reasons he yielded rule of the woodsfolk to Túrin by their choice.<ref>{{SM|Q13}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n|race=edain\n|house=[[House of Haleth]]\n|born={{FA|465}}\n|died={{FA|499}}\n}}\n{{seq\n|pvac=\n|prev=[[Handir]]\n|next=[[Hardang]]\n|list=[[Chieftain of the Haladin]]\n|dates={{FA|495}} - {{FA|499|n}}\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Children of Húrin]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:Chieftains of Brethil]]\n[[Category:Edain]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:House of Haleth]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n\n[[de:Brandir]]\n[[fi:Brandir (Handirin poika)]]\n[[fr:encyclo:personnages:hommes:1a:peuple de haleth:brandir]]"}}}
