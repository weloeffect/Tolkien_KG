And while living there, the heart of Idril was turned to Tuor, and his to her. Because Turgon had grown to love Tuor as a son (as he had his father before), and remembering the last words of Huor, he allowed Idril and Tuor to wed, thus bringing about the second [[Unions of Elves and Men|union of Elves and Men]], after [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]].<ref name=\"Tuor\">{{S|Gondolin}}</ref> From them [[Eärendil]] [[Half-elven]] was born, and she gave him the [[mother-name]] ''[[Ardamírë]]'', that foretold his destiny.<ref>{{PM|Finwe}}, p. 348</ref>\n\nYears later, Morgoth had increased his efforts to find the city, \"but Idril Celebrindal was wise and farseeing, and her heart misgave her, and foreboding crept upon her spirit as a cloud.\" Therefore, Idril let prepare a [[Idril's secret way|secret way]], and she contrived that this work was not known to Maeglin.

Tuor also loved her in secret for many years until his heart was full, and Turgon did not oppose to their union.

Thus, one year after the birth of [[Eärendel]], she told Tuor of a dream she had: Meglin threw their son into a furnace and he wanted to thrust them in too. Therefore, she asked Tuor to begin the building of a [[Idril's secret way|secret way]].<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|167–8}} Seven years later, Idril became taciturn, and prophesied to Tuor that he would have to make a choice, and that the time was near.

Her husband left her there with [[Voronwë]] and other men, and went to battle.<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|177–8}}\n\nDuring the siege of the city, Idril was in the door of her house and sent most of her guard down the secret tunnel with Eärendel. But she refused to leave without her lord. Meanwhile, she gathered women and wanderers, showing them the secret tunnel; and her men helped her fighting marauders, but they might not dissuade her from bearing a sword. However, a band of enemies took over the house, and Idril became distraught by grief and fatigue, and running away from the house she arrived to Gar Ainion. There Tuor found her like in the day of their wedding, but she could not recognize him: she was out of her mind, watching the fall of her father. Then Tuor took her and went down the secret tunnel. When the [[Exiles of Gondolin]] reached [[Tumladin]], she spoke against those who wanted to march to the [[Way of Escape]], explaining it was no longer protected, \"''for what magic stands if Gondolin be fallen?''\"<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|186–9}} After the survivors were saved by the [[Eagles]], Idril and her people wore an eagle as emblem.<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|193}}\n\nTolkien did not finish ''The Book of Lost Tales'', so the end of Idril and Tuor is very different in each outline of their story.
