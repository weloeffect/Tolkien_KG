Lurtz was invented by [[Warner Bros.]] for [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]], where he was portrayed by [[Lawrence Makoare]]. Though an original character, Lurtz inherits traits from [[Uglúk]], the leader of Isengard Uruk-hai in the book.\n\n==History==\nLurtz was the first of [[Saruman|Saruman's]] [[Uruk-hai]] to be bred, and led them into battle against the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] at [[Amon Hen]]. Lurtz also appeared to be the largest Uruk-hai, and his strength is highlighted when he strangles an Orc immediately after being spawned. In the book, [[Boromir]] is slain by an unnamed orc or orcs; he is described as having been \"pierced by many arrows\". In the film he is killed by Lurtz, who shot him three times. Before he could shoot a fourth arrow into Boromir, [[Aragorn]] intervened and a duel ensued. While Lurtz seemed to have the upper hand in the beginning due to his brute strength, he fell utterly short when it came to swordfighting; Aragorn quickly severed his opponent's sword arm and delivered a fatal thrust to the stomach. Lurtz tried to taunt Aragorn one last time, but was shortly after decapitated.\n\nAfter his death, leadership of the troop of Uruk-hai passed to [[Uglúk]], as was always the case in the books.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Lurtz\" may have been derived by [[Peter Jackson]] and his co-writers from the style of Tolkien's [[Orkish]] language, specifically the name [[Barad-dûr#Etymology|Lugbúrz]].\n\nLurtz's name is never spoken aloud in the film, and is only known from the franchise and credits.\n\n==Other versions==\nIn video games, Lurtz has been voiced by [[Isaac C. Singleton Jr.]].\n\nLurtz is one of the playable heroes of the Isengard Faction in ''[[EA's The Battle for Middle-earth Anthology]]''.\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{lordoftheringsfilms}}\n\n[[Category:Orcs from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings (film series) characters]]"}}}
