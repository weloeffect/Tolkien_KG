[[Entulessë|ever a ship]] sailed hither from the [[Númenor|West]].|Denethor II}}\n\n'''Pre-Númenóreans''' are the indigenous [[Men|Mannish peoples]] of [[Middle-earth]], in contrast to the [[Dúnedain]] who drew their heritage from [[Númenor]].\n\nThese indigenous peoples were the descendants of the second group of the [[Edain]] who migrated to the West in the [[First Age]]; their relatives who reached [[Beleriand]] became the [[House of Haleth|Haladin]] while they themselves stayed in the eastern regions of Middle-earth that would be later settled by the [[Númenóreans]] (hence the name). \n\nFrom the perspective of the Dúnedain, these [[Middle Men]] were considered unrelated to them or the [[Northmen]]. \n\n==History==\n===First Age===\nThe [[Awakening of Men|first Men]] moved from [[Hildórien]] to the [[Westlands|West]]; during their migration those of the [[Folk of Haleth|second group]] joined the [[Woses|Drúedain]] near the [[White Mountains]] and stayed with them. When the core of their team was pressed to wander on, some Drúedain accompanied them westwards{{fact}}, passing through the [[Gap of Calenardhon]]. \n\nHowever some of them did not go through the dense forest covering the [[Minhiriath]] and the western half of [[Enedwaith]] and stayed behind; those herd-tenders eventually expanded to the forests of the shore-lands south of the [[Blue Mountains]], especially in Minhiriath.<ref name=\"DM\">{{PM|X}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the [[First Age]] the branches of those peoples had spread as far as [[Cardolan]] in the north, and as far south as [[Umbar]].\n\n===Second Age===\nBy the [[Second Age]] the Men of the White Mountains were scattered communities of forest-dwellers without central leadership.<ref name=\"GC\">{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref> With the destruction of [[Beleriand]] in the [[War of Wrath]], evil Men and [[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterlings]] fled from [[Angband]] and apparently took in larger numbers to the hills of [[Rhudaur]] and the Mountains of [[Angmar]]. These [[Men of Darkness]] terrorized and conquered the Men of the Mountains who had refused to join in the rebellion against the Valar.<ref name=\"DM\"/><ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Gondor]] there were Pre-Númenórean communities far from the sea, such as [[Agar]]<ref>{{PM|Elmar}}</ref> and a primitive harbour of fisherfolk, who feared the [[Eldar]] of [[Edhellond]], and fled to the White Mountains.<ref name=\"DM\"/><ref name=\"GC\"/>\n\nWhen the Númenóreans returned to [[Middle-earth]], they failed to recognize the forest-folk of [[Minhiriath]] as \"kinsmen\" of the Edain, and confused them with Men of Darkness because their [[Pre-Númenórean|language]] was not related to [[Adûnaic]].<ref name=\"DM\"/> \n\nAldarion's successors continued his works and even fought with the natives<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}</ref> until they attacked and ambushed the Númenóreans when they could. They became their enemies giving no thought to husbandry or replanting. The Númenóreans wrecked the banks, the shorelines, and built great tracks and roads into the forests northwards and southwards from the [[Gwathló]].<ref name=\"GC\"/> They continued battling and destroying what lay ahead of them, pushing into Minhiriath and Enedwaith, establishing themselves inland as far as the river [[Glanduin]], beyond which natives and hostile peoples lived, a remnant of the peoples that had dwelt in the vales of the White Mountains in ages past.<ref name=\"GC\"/><ref name=\"lang\"/> The natives overcame their fear of the Elves and fled from Minhiriath into the dark woods of the great Cape of [[Eryn Vorn]] (south of the mouth of [[Baranduin]]). Those from Enedwaith took refuge in the eastern mountains ([[Dunland]]).<ref name=\"GC\"/>\n\n[[Sauron]] recruited pre-Númenóreans and in the early second millennium he increased pressure on the West, left his stronghold in the [[East]] and relocated in [[Mordor]]. He was welcomed by the natives and used the haters of Númenor as spies and guides for his raiders who caused havoc and burned their settlements.\n\nAround that time the Men of the White Mountains fled to the southern dales of the [[Misty Mountains]] during the [[Dark Years]], and thence some passed into the empty lands until the [[Barrow-downs]]; from them came the '''[[Men of Bree]]''' (q.v.)<ref name=\"lang\">{{App|F1}}</ref>\n\nEriador was already ruined when king [[Tar-Minastir]] sent a Númenórean fleet that utterly defeated Sauron, bringing peace in the [[Westlands]] ({{SA|1700}}).<ref name=\"GC\"/> The surviving pre-Númenóreans now apparently crossed the Glanduin back south to Dunland which now seemed safer than wrecked Eregion.\n\nIn the south the Númenóreans found a useful natural haven already called [[Umbar]] by the natives, and then [[Pelargir]] in {{SA|2350}} who made contact with Men who dwelt in the valleys on either side of the White Mountains.<ref name=\"DM\"/> Of those were the '''[[Men of the Mountains]]''' (q.v.) near [[Dunharrow]].<ref>{{HM|RK}}</ref> who repented when Sauron left from Mordor and the power of [[Gil-galad]] had grown great.<ref name=\"Rings\">{{S|Rings}}</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Elendili]] established the [[Realms in Exile]] many Men turned from evil and became subject to them; the [[King of the Dead|King of the Mountains]] first swore allegiance to [[Gondor]]. However many natives never learned to distinguish between [[King's Men]] and [[Faithful]], while many remembered Sauron's influence so they were hostile to them.<ref name=\"Rings\"/> \n\nWhen Sauron returned, [[Isildur]] summoned the King of the Mountains to fulfill their oath, but they would not because they were afraid of Sauron. They hid in the mountains isolated till they slowly dwindled in the barren hills and became the [[Dead Men of Dunharrow]].\n\n===Third Age===\nThe indigenous Men of Eriador were absorbed by the civilisation of [[Arnor]].<ref name=\"lang\"/> By the time of [[Valandil (King of Arnor)|Valandil]] this mixed population was diminished and there was not enough people to maintain all the places built by Elendil, until eventually Arnor was split into smaller realms.<ref name=\"Rings\"/> However when the [[Hobbits]] came to Arnor, Númenóreans, allies and enemies were numerous.<ref name=\"DM\"/> The Númenorean element was stronger in [[Arthedain]] and thinner in [[Rhudaur]] until utterly failed. Eventually [[Angmar]] was populated by evil men gathered by the [[Witch-king]].<ref name=\"A\">{{HM|AA}}</ref>\n\n'''[[Hill-men]]''' (q.v.) practiced [[magic]]<ref>{{PM|Third}}</ref> and from the 14th century on, fortified the hills of Eriador with dark structures<ref name=\"Elendil\">{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> harassed Rhudaur until an evil lord, allied with Angmar, seized its throne and eventually all of Rhudaur was occupied by evil Men subject to Angmar. The Dúnedain were either slain or fled west.<ref name=\"A\"/> The [[Angmar War]] however caused those populations to perish.<ref name=\"DM\"/> [[Cardolan]] was also deserted and could not be repopulated.<ref name=\"Elendil\"/> Rhudaur came to be inhabited only by monsters. After the [[Great Plague]], [[Minhiriath]] was deserted except for hunters in [[Eryn Vorn]]. Other known Mannish settlements included only the [[Bree-land]] and the [[Lossoth]] in the far North.\n\nThe indigenous Men were also absorbed in the South Kingdom of [[Gondor]], which pursued an expansionist policy. Gondor's borders were extended by the [[Ship-kings]], subduing the pre-Númenóreans. Their blood was mixed and in the following generations the Dúnedain's power and wisdom was diminished.<ref name=\"Rings\"/>\n\nAs Gondor expanded East and South, the few remote '''[[Dunlendings]]''' (q.v.) resisted the Númenórean influence and [[Enedwaith]] had no such settlements,<ref name=\"Isen\">{{UT|Isen}}</ref> other than [[Tharbad]].<ref name=\"DM\"/> They remained unaffected, independent and even unfriendly to the Dúnedain, holding their own manners and [[Dunlendish]] language.<ref name=\"lang\"/> By the time of the [[Ruling Stewards]] they ceased to be subjects of Gondor and, from the foothills of the Misty Mountains moved to now-depopulated [[Calenardhon]], until they were deplaced by the [[Éothéod]]. Some people remaining between Isen and Adorn were largely of mixed blood, and not loyal to Edoras.<ref name=\"Isen\"/>\n\nBefore the [[War of the Ring]], [[Saruman]] found in those peoples an opportunity for creating crossbreeds of Orcs and Men. The Dunlendings allied with him and joined his forces in the [[Battle of the Hornburg]]. After the War, under King [[Éomer]], there was relative peace.<ref name=\"A\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nIn anthropology, archeology and linguistics, the prefix Pre- is used to indicate a prehistoric state before the arrival or emergence of a dominant state of peoples or languages (a [[Wikipedia:superstratum|superstratum]]).
