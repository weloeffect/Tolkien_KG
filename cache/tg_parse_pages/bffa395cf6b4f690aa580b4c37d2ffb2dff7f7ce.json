This scene was extended in the latter edition.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Gollum]] leads [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] out of [[Emyn Muil]] and into the [[Dead Marshes]], which stretch far towards [[Mordor]]. He tells them that he knows safe paths through the marshes and that [[Orcs]] do not, and so go around instead. \n\nAs they rest and Frodo and Sam eat [[lembas|''lembas'']], Gollum complains that he is ''\"famished\"''. Taking pity on him, Frodo gives him some of the ''lembas'', but he is unable to eat it and complains he must starve. Sam bids him \"''starve then, and good riddance''\". In response Gollum calls him cruel and says he does not care, but then turns to Frodo, and says \"''Master cares. Master knows ... Once it takes hold of us, it never lets go.''\" As Gollum reaches out to touch Frodo, Frodo bats his hand away, telling him not to touch him.\n\nAfter their stop, Gollum continues leading them through the Marshes and tells them to be careful. Sam notices dead bodies in the water. \n{{blockquote|All dead. All rotten. Elves and Men and Orcses. [[Battle of Dagorlad|A great battle]] long ago.|[[Gollum]]}}\nFrodo stops and is drawn to one of the dead [[Elves]] and falls into the water. Under water, he sees hands trying to grab him and a screaming face getting closer to him, before Gollum pulls him out of the water and back onto land. \n\nAt night, Frodo lies stroking [[The One Ring|the Ring]] and hears Gollum speaking of the beauty of his precious. Frodo quickly puts the Ring away and asks Gollum who he is. The conversation between the two moves backwards and forwards between them before Frodo says to him \"''You were not so very different from a hobbit once, were you Sméagol?''\" After a moment of shock, Gollum smiles as he remembers his name. \n\nThe shriek of a [[Nazgûl]] forces the three to hide. Gollum is terrified at the wraith flying atop a [[fell beast]], but the pain of Frodo's wound immobilises him. Sam helps him hide and says he thought they were dead,<ref group=\"note\">In the scene ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'': \"[[Flight to the Ford (scene)|Flight to the Ford]]\", the Nazgûl are shown to be washed away by the [[Bruinen]].</ref> but Gollum tells him they cannot be killed and that they are calling for the Ring. Frodo's hand reaches for the Ring, but Sam stops it. After a short time, the Nazgûl flies away. Gollum tells them the [[Black Gate]] is now \"''very close''\".\n\n{{notes}}\n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers scenes|14]]"}}}
