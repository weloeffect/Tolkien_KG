They were unmoved, wanting no other realm than [[Eldamar]] and no other lord than Olwë. [[Fëanor]] reproached Olwë and his people as \"fainthearted loiterers\" and reminded them that the [[Noldor]] had aided them when they first arrived. Olwë rebuked Fëanor's folly and refused to give him any ships of the [[Teleri]], which they valued as the Noldor did their gems. [[Fëanor]] withdrew but then led his forces to [[Alqualondë]] to take the ships by force, leading to the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë|first Kinslaying]].
