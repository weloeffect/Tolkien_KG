They had intended to rescue the captives, but the Orcs slew their prisoners and pinned [[Finduilas]] to a tree with a spear.<ref name=\"Turin\" /> \n\nLater he and his woodmen were surrounded by Orcs. While [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]] was in search of Finduilas he came upon them and rescued them, and Dorlas told him of Finduilas' death. Dorlas and his men led Túrin to where the woodmen buried Finduilas, the [[Haudh-en-Elleth]], and Túrin collapsed in grief. Dorlas then had Túrin carried to their stockade upon [[Amon Obel]].<ref name=\"Turin\" />\n\nLater, when [[Glaurung]] sent orcs to attack the woodmen, Túrin refused fight because of his promise to [[Níniel]] not to go to battle unless their homes were assailed. Dorlas upbraided Túrin for his inaction; Túrin then led a company of the [[Men of Brethil]] who defeated the orcs. This action revealed to Glaurung where Túrin lived. Glaurung then sought to assail Brethil, and Túrin called for volunteers to go fight the dragon. Only Dorlas stepped forward, and he chastised his people and spoke ill of [[Brandir]], who could not go on account of his lameness. [[Hunthor]] then volunteered to go in his stead.<ref name=\"Turin\" />\n\nHowever, when Túrin, Hunthor, and Dorlas came to the ravines of [[Taeglin]], Dorlas was overwhelmed with fear and would not cross. Abandoning his companions, he hid in the forest, but Brandir found him.<ref name=\"Turin\" /> In anger, Dorlas struck out at Brandir, but was himself slain, for Brandir drew his sword and killed him .<ref>{{CH|17}}, p. 246</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nThe name of ''Dorlas'' was changed to that of ''Darlas'', in a later note.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, Note 55</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| DOR | |DOR='''DORLAS'''<br /><small>''d. {{FA|499}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| |!| | |}}\n{{familytree| AVR | |AVR=[[Avranc]]<br /><small>''fl. {{FA|501}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Children of Húrin]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:Edain]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Folk of Haleth]]\n\n[[de:Dorlas]]\n[[fi:Dorlas]]\n[[fr:encyclo:personnages:hommes:1a:peuple de haleth:dorlas]]"}}}
