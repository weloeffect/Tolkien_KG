[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] was influenced by both the artistic and literary work of Morris.\n\n==Literary influence==\n\nLiterary works by Morris, which Tolkien explicitly stated to have had an impact on his writing, are his translation of the ''[[List of books in Tolkien's library#Völsunga Saga|Völsunga Saga]]'',<ref name=CGMorris>{{CG|RG}}, \"Morris, William\", pp. 598-604</ref> and his novels ''[[The House of the Wolfings]]'' and ''[[The Roots of the Mountains]]''. Tolkien also said in an early letter to [[Edith Tolkien|Edith]] that he tried to use some of Morris's literary techniques when writing \"[[The Story of Kullervo]]\".<ref>{{L|1}}</ref><ref>Michael W. Perry, \"Morris, Williams\", in ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia: Scholarship and Critical Assessment]]''</ref>\n\nFurthermore, scholars have deduced possible implicit influences from these and several others of Morris's works: ''The Earthly Paradise'' (for ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''),<ref name=CGMorris/> ''The Roots of the Mountains'' (for [[Gollum]]),<ref name=TS>[[Tom Shippey]], \"Introduction\", in ''The Wood beyond the World'' (Oxford, 1980)</ref> ''The Wood beyond the World'' (for [[Lothlórien]] and [[Fangorn Forest|Fangorn]]),<ref name=TS/> and his translation of ''The Saga of Gunnlaug the Worm-tongue'' (for [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]]).<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 400</ref>\n\n==Artistic influence==\nIn several illustrations, Tolkien was clearly inspired by the decorative style found in the [[wikipedia:Arts and Crafts Movement|Arts and Crafts Movement]] (of which Morris was the central figure and one of the founders) and the related [[wikipedia:Art Nouveau|Art Nouveau]]. The design philosophy of Morris was to re-introduce traditional craftsmanship by using simple forms and patterns and often medieval, romantic or folk styles of decoration (in reaction to early to the early modern industrial design), a theme which can be seen in some of Tolkien's illustrations from the late 1920s (see, e.g., '[[:File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Tol Sirion (Colored by H.E. Riddett).jpg|Tol Sirion]]'), some of his paintings for ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the ornamental patterns drawn in later years,<ref name=CGMorris/><ref>{{HM|AI}}, pp. 9-10</ref> and his hand-drawn maps of [[Middle-earth]].<ref>Alice Campbell, \"Maps\", in ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia: Scholarship and Critical Assessment]]''</ref> It is known that Tolkien owned a copy of Morris' lecture ''Some Hints on Pattern Designing'' (1899).<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/20753/lot/355/|articlename=Lot 355.
