It was extended in the latter edition.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Aragorn]] steps outside of the [[Golden Hall]] at night. [[Legolas]] is standing, looking at the stars, and tells Aragorn that he can feel something stirring in the [[East]]. \n\nInside, [[Pippin]], unable to sleep, gets up and makes his way towards where [[Gandalf]] is sleeping. [[Merry]] asks him what he is doing, and Pippin tells him he wants to look into the [[palantír]] one more time. Carefully, he takes it from Gandalf's grasp, unwraps it, and looks into it. Slowly, the Eye of Sauron fills the palantír. Pippin struggles and screams, and Merry shouts for Gandalf to help. The wizard wakes as Aragorn and Legolas run inside. Aragorn takes the palantír from Pippin temporarily but is unable to hold it for long. As it rolls across the floor, Gandalf covers it with a cloth. \n\n{{blockquote|Fool of a Took!|[[Gandalf]] to [[Pippin]]}}\n\nGandalf ensures Pippin is alive before asking him what he saw. Pippin told [[Sauron]] nothing about [[Frodo]]'s quest and saw a [[White Tree of Gondor|White Tree]] burning. Gandalf understands that Pippin saw a glimpse of Sauron's plan: [[Minas Tirith]], home of the White Tree, will be first to be struck. The wizard tells [[Théoden]] to be ready to ride for [[Gondor]] once the [[Warning beacons of Gondor|beacons]] are lit, and somewhat cryptically tells Aragorn he must come to Minas Tirith by \"another road. Follow the river, look to the [[Corsairs of Umbar|black ships]].\" Gandalf decides to go to Minas Tirith, and that Pippin must go with him. \n\nAs Gandalf readies [[Shadowfax]], Merry tries to explain to Pippin that, since he looked into the palantír, Sauron will be looking for him. Merry gives him the last of the [[Longbottom Leaf]], and Pippin asks him for reassurance that they will see each other again. Merry shares an uncertain glance with Gandalf before saying he does not know what will happen. \n\nMerry and Aragorn watch Gandalf and Pippin depart on Shadowfax. Aragorn comforts the hobbit, saying \"One thing I've learned about hobbits: they are a most hardy folk\". \"Foolhardy maybe. He's a Took!\" Merry says in return.\n\n==Differences==\nAfter going to [[Isengard]], in the movie, Gandalf and the Company return to [[Edoras]] where Pippin looks into the palantír. However, in the book, the Company set out from Isengard and camped in a dale close to [[Dol Baran]]; it was here where Pippin looked into the palantír.<ref name=\"TT Palantir\">{{TT|Palantir}}</ref>{{rp|591–4}} Furthermore, a [[Nazgûl]] flew over them on its way north,<ref name=\"TT Palantir\"/>{{rp|595–6}} (this event is not present in the scene) causing Gandalf to ride to Minas Tirith, taking Pippin with him. \n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King scenes|08]]"}}}
