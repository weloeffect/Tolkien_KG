It's a much-needed reminder that we Christians are all on an epic quest. In examining the Christian themes in the trilogy, authors Kurt Bruner and Jim Ware find that truth and fiction are not as far apart as they seem. When read in the light of Scripture, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien's]] trilogy reveals a rich tapestry of redemption, values, and faith against all odds.\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Religious books]]"}}}
