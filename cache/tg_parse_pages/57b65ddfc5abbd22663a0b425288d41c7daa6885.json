Tolkien]].\n\n==From the publisher==\n\nBrought together in one volume for the first time, '''The Tolkien Fan's Medieval Reader''' presents many of the medieval texts that were important to Tolkien's professional work and to his fiction. Prose versions have been selected to introduce Tolkien's modern readers to such marvel-filled works as [[Beowulf (poem)|Beowulf]], [[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]], and the [[Prose Edda|Prose Edda of Snorri Sturluson]] - three classics that every fantasy fan will enjoy on their own merits. Many will also appreciate seeing firsthand how these works, and others in this book - from Old English, Middle English, Old Norse, the Celtic languages and Finnish - served as inspiration for elements in Tolkien's great imaginary world of [[Middle-earth]] dragons, elves, dwarves, monsters, magical swords and heroes.\n{{title|italics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tolkien Fan's Medieval Reader}}\n[[Category:Fiction books]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Reference books]]"}}}
