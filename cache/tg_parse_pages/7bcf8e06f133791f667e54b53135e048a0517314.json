As a consequence, Haudh-in-Gwanur is probably in Ithilien rather than in Harondor. In addition, it is mentioned that orcs from [[Mordor]] cast down the tall stone that crowned the mound in {{TA|2954}} and that Princess [[Éowyn]] of Ithilien caused the standing stone of Haudh-in-Gwanur to be restored soon after the War of the Ring.\n \n:In ''[[Southern Gondor: The People]]'' it is mentioned that the men of the city of ''Amrûn'' cast down the standing stone of Haudh-in-Gwanur at Athrad Poros in the year {{TA|2954}}.\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Haudh in Gwanur}}\n[[Category:Graves and tombs]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[de:Haudh in Gwanûr]]\n[[fi:Haudh in Gwanûr]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/tombes/haudh in gwanur]]"}}}
