Tolkien]] posthumously published by [[Christopher Tolkien]] in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' and also in two other places (see below \"Textual history\" section). This work explains how and why [[Gandalf]] arranged for the retaking of the [[Lonely Mountain]] (''Erebor'' in [[Sindarin]]), an adventure recounted from the perspective of [[Bilbo Baggins]] some time before in the adventures ''[[The Hobbit]]''.\n\n==Background==\n'''The Quest of Erebor''' (as well as [[The Hunt for the Ring]]) was originally written between [[1954]]-[[1955]] to be a part of the [[Appendices]] to ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' but Tolkien was forced to omit them for lack of space,<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. xxxiv</ref> and only a very abridged version of the tale occurred in the Appendices. The work is written in the first person, from the perspective of [[Frodo Baggins]], however nearly all the text consists of narration by Gandalf, who was telling the story at the request of Frodo in [[Minas Tirith]] after the coronation of [[Aragorn|King Elessar]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[File:Alan Lee - A Chance Meeting.jpg|thumb|right|''A chance meeting'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]\nGandalf knew that [[Smaug]] the [[Dragons|Dragon]] could pose a serious threat if used by [[Sauron]], then dwelling in [[Dol Guldur]] in [[Mirkwood]]. He was thinking about the matter when he met [[Thorin]] at [[Bree]]. Thorin also was concerned about Smaug, but had the different motive of revenge and the reclaiming of the [[Dwarves]]' treasure in the Lonely Mountain. Gandalf agreed to help Thorin.\n\nGandalf thought Bilbo, an unlikely choice, to be a suitable companion of Thorin and his Dwarves for a number of reasons. First, he had observed that Bilbo took an interest in the world at large, and was thus adventurous. Another reason is that Smaug would not recognize the scent of a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]], advantageous to a stealthy operation. Thorin also did not think highly of Hobbits, and putting Bilbo in the expedition might prevent the proud Thorin from rash actions &mdash; such as openly challenging Smaug.\n\nIt was Thorin's objections to Bilbo that Gandalf found most difficult to overcome.  Thorin believed that Bilbo was incapable of helping their adventure and that Gandalf might be simply meddling in his affairs for his own reasons. After much debate, Gandalf convinced Thorin that Bilbo would be a worthy member.\n\n===Appendix===\nThere is an Appendix to this chapter that explores the differences between the four versions of the text, giving short excerpts of alternate versions to the one given in full.\n\n==Textual history==\nThis text exists in four versions, in the order of the composition dates:\n\n''(A).'' The earliest version, published in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'' (1996).\n\n''(B).'' A version \"much rewritten if not essentially changed\" from ''(A)''.<ref>{{PM|Aiv}}</ref>\n\n''(C).'' A version that, compares to ''(B)'', has \"a great deal of further alteration, though mostly of a very minor kind\".<ref>{{UT|9a}}</ref> This is published fully in ''[[The Annotated Hobbit]]'' 2nd edition (2002).\n\n''(D).'' The latest, but much \"compressed\" version. This is published in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' (1980).\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Quest of Erebor}}\n[[Category:Manuscripts by J.R.R.
