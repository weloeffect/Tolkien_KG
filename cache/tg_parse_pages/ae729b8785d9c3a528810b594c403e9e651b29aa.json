He was the son of [[Freca]] and it was said that their family had a measure of [[Dunlendings|dunlendish]] blood.\n==History==\nFreca attempted to force a marriage between Wulf and the daughter of King [[Helm|Helm Hammerhand]]. When Freca's plan failed, he was slain, and Wulf found himself declared the King's enemy. He fled across the borders into [[Dunland]], where he seems to have been warmly received. For four years, Wulf built up his power in Dunland, and allied himself with Rohan's and [[Gondor]]'s enemies. \n\nIn the year {{TA|2758}}, with Rohan's armies drawn into the east to repel an attack there, Wulf and his allies invaded from the west. They devastated Helm's forces at the [[Fords of Isen]] and overran the country and took [[Edoras]], where Wulf killed Prince [[Haleth (son of Helm)|Haleth]]; he sat in the [[Golden Hall]] and claimed the Kingship of Rohan. \n\nThe exiled King, Helm, was driven into hiding in the mountains. During the [[Long Winter]] Wulf's armies besieged him at [[Hornburg]], and Helm's nephew, [[Fréaláf]] at [[Dunharrow]]. Helm and his second son died of the cold. In the spring, Helm was avenged by Fréaláf, who led a small party into Edoras and killed 'King' Wulf in {{TA|2759}}. With help from [[Gondor]], Fréaláf cleared Wulf's followers from Rohan, and succeeded his uncle Helm to become its tenth rightful King.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| FRE | |FRE=[[Freca]]<br /><small>''d. {{TA|2754}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| |!| | |}}\n{{familytree| WUL | |WUL='''WULF'''<br /><small>''d. {{TA|2759}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Frealaf defeats Wulf Frecason in Meduseld.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'' tapestry: Frealaf defeats Wulf Frecason in Meduseld]]\n'''2012: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n: A tapestry depicting Fréaláf killing Wulf is found in [[Meduseld]] and can be acquired for use in player's houses.\n\n[[File:The War of the Rohirrim - Wulf.jpg|thumb|Wulf as seen in [[The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim|The War of the Rohirrim]]]]\n'''2024: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim]]'':'''\n: Luke Pasqualino is the voice for Wulf in the anime film.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14824600/fullcredits|articlename=|dated=|website=[https://www.imdb.com IMDB]|accessed=June 11th, 2024}}</ref>\n\n\n\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Dunlendings]]\n[[Category:Old English names]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[de:Wulf]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/hommes/3a/hommes du nord/rohirrim/wulf]]\n[[fi:Wulf]]"}}}
