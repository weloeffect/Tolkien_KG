Tolkien]]. Each painting is accompanied by a page of text drawn from the work that inspired it. Artists include [[Inger Edelfeldt]], [[John Howe]], [[Roger Garland]], [[Michael Hague]], and others. Due to the success of this book, in [[1996]] ''[[Realms of Tolkien]]'' was published, featuring even more art.\n\n==From the publisher==\n[[Middle-earth]], the world created by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] in his timeless classics ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', has been an inspiration for generations of artists. This beautiful volume of artwork celebrates the legacy of his imagination. ''Tolkien's World'' includes paintings by artists from all over the world. From the powerful depictions of the darker side of Middle-earth by [[John Howe]], to the evocative landscapes by [[Alan Lee]]; from [[Michael Hague]]'s delightful paintings in ''The Hobbit'' to the strange and compelling vision of [[Roger Garland]]; from the engaging simplicity of [[Inger Edelfeldt]]'s work to the intricacy of dramatic realism of [[Ted Nasmith]] - Tolkien's World spans the whole of Middle-earth. Each painting is accompanied by a page of text drawn from the book that inspired it, describing the scene the artist has chosen to illustrate. Also included is a short essay by each of the artists about Tolkien's influence upon them.\n\n==Featured artwork==\n* '''[[Inger Edelfeldt]]''':\n** [[:File:Inger Edelfeldt - Gollum.jpg|Gollum]]\n** [[:File:Inger Edelfeldt - A Long Expected Party.jpg|A Long-expected Party]]\n** [[:File:Inger Edelfeldt - Legolas.jpg|Legolas]]\n** [[:File:Inger Edelfeldt - The Dead Marshes.jpg|The Dead Marshes]]\n** [[:File:Inger Edelfeldt - The Oliphaunt.jpg|The Oliphaunt]]\n** [[:File:Inger Edelfeldt - The Scouring of the Shire.jpg|The Scouring of the Shire]]\n** [[:File:Inger Edelfeldt - The Death of Glaurung.jpg|The Death of Glaurung]]\n* '''Carol Emery Phenix''':\n** [[:File:Carol Emery Phenix - Smaug.jpg|The Glow of Smaug]]\n** [[:File:Carol Emery Phenix - Weathertop.jpg|Attack at Weathertop]]\n* '''Tony Galuidi''':\n** Saruman\n** Barad-dûr\n* '''[[Roger Garland]]''':\n** [[:File:Roger Garland - Tom Bombadil.jpg|Tom Bombadil]]\n** [[:File:Roger Garland - The Bridge of Khazad-dum.JPG|The Bridge of Khazad-dûm]]\n** [[:File:Roger Garland - The Lord of the Nazgul.JPG|The Lord of the Nazgûl]]\n** [[:Image:Roger Garland - Ulmo.jpg|Ulmo, Lord of the Waters]]\n** [[:File:Roger Garland - Melkor chained.jpg|The Chaining of Melkor]]\n** [[:File:Roger Garland - Earendil and Elwing.jpeg|Earendil and Elwing]]\n** [[:File:Roger Garland - The Gate of Morn.jpg|The Gates of Morn]]\n** [[:File:Roger Garland - The Smith of Wootton Major.jpg|The Smith of Wootton Major]]\n** [[:File:Roger Garland - The Haven of Moriondë.jpg|The Haven of Moriondë]]\n** [[:File:Roger Garland - Return of the Shadow.JPG|The Brandywine River]]\n* '''Robert Goldsmith''':\n** On the Road to Rivendell\n** Sam in Mordor\n* '''[[Michael Hague]]''':\n** [[:File:Michael Hague - Riddles in the Dark.jpg|Riddles in the Dark]]\n** [[:File:Michael Hague - Rescued From Wolves.jpg|Rescued by Eagles]]\n** [[:File:Michael Hague - Flying with Eagles.jpg|Flying with the Eagles]]\n** [[:File:Michael Hague - Thorin, Prisoner of the Elves.jpg|Thorin, Prisoner of the Elves]]\n** [[:File:Michael Hague - Smaug the Magnificent.jpg|Smaug the Magnificent]]\n** [[:File:Michael Hague - The Black Arrow.jpg|The Black Arrow]]\n** [[:File:Michael Hague - The Arkenstone.jpg|The Arkenstone]]\n* '''[[John Howe]]''':\n** [[:File:John Howe - The Great Goblin.jpg|The Great Goblin]]\n** [[:File:John Howe - Smaug Destroys Lake-town.jpg|Smaug over Esgaroth]]\n** [[:File:John Howe - Gandalf the Grey 02.jpg|Gandalf]]\n** [[:File:John Howe - The Uruk-hai.jpg|The Uruk-hai]]\n** [[:File:John Howe - The Dark Tower 01.jpg|The Dark Tower]]\n** [[:File:John Howe - Sam and Shelob.jpg|Sam and Shelob]]\n** [[:File:John Howe - Minas Tirith.jpg|Minas Tirith]]\n** [[:File:John Howe - In Mordor.jpg|In Mordor]]\n** [[:File:John Howe - The Fall of Gondolin.jpg|The Fall of Gondolin]]\n** [[:File:John Howe - The Death of Glaurung.jpg|Turambar and Glorund]]\n* '''[[Alan Lee]]''':\n** [[:File:Alan Lee - The Shadow of the Past.jpg|Frodo and Gandalf]]\n** [[:File:Alan Lee - Lúthien Tinúviel.jpg|Lúthien Tinúviel]]\n** [[:File:Alan Lee - The Stone-trolls.jpg|The Stone Trolls]]\n** [[:File:Alan Lee - The West-gate of Moria.jpg|The Entrance to Moria]]\n** [[:File:Alan Lee - The Mirror of Galadriel.jpg|Galadriel's Mirror]]\n** [[:File:Alan Lee - Tol Brandir.jpg|Tol Brandir]]\n** [[:File:Alan Lee - The White Rider.jpg|Searching Fangorn]]\n** [[:File:Alan Lee - The Battle of the Pelennor Fields.jpg|The Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]\n** [[:File:Alan Lee - Cirith Ungol.jpg|Cirith Ungol]]\n** [[:File:Alan Lee - Mount Doom.jpg|Mount Doom]]\n* '''[[Ted Nasmith]]''':\n** [[:File:Ted Nasmith - Rivendell.jpg|Rivendell]]\n** [[:File:Ted Nasmith - Green Hill Country.jpg|Green Hill Country]]\n** [[:File:Ted Nasmith - Leaving the Shire.jpg|Leaving the Shire]]\n** [[:Image:Ted Nasmith - Under the Spell of the Barrow-wight.jpg|Under the Spell of the Barrow-wight]]\n** [[:Image:Ted Nasmith - Riders at The Ford.jpg|Riders at the Ford]]\n** [[:File:Ted Nasmith - The Anger of the Mountain.jpg|The Anger of the Mountain]]\n** [[:File:Ted Nasmith - The Balrog.jpg|The Balrog]]\n** [[:File:Ted Nasmith - The Last Words of Boromir.jpg|The Last Words of Boromir]]\n** [[:File:Ted Nasmith - Wellinghall.jpg|Wellinghall]]\n** [[:File:Ted Nasmith - The Glittering Caves of Aglarond.jpg|The Glittering Caves of Aglarond]]\n\n{{title|italic}}\n[[Category:Art books]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
