Túvo was said to have learned \"much black [[magic]]\" from Melko, and that after the [[darkening of Valinor]], he went to the Great Lands where he set up a \"wizard kingship\".<ref name=Glo/>\n\nHowever, in later texts, the character of Tû lost these negative connotations,<ref name=Glo/> and instead became the protector of Elves and Men.<ref name=Thu/>\n\n{{references}}\n{{title}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tu (king of the Hisildi)}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Fays]]\n[[Category:Rulers in the Great Lands]]"}}}
