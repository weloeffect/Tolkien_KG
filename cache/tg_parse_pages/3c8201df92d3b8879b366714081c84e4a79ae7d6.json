Tolkien]]. It is in the form of a folk-tale in modern English that takes inspiration from both ''[[Beowulf (poem)]]'' and the Norse ''[[Hrólfs saga kraka]]'', and follows the plot of Beowulf up to the slaying of Grendel's mother. The manuscript is held by the [[Bodleian Library]].<ref name=MB>{{HM|MB}}, pp. 256-60, 281-2 (note 8)</ref>\n\nSellic Spell was edited by Christopher Tolkien and published in 2014 as part of Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary, together with Sellic Spell.\n\n==Names==\nTolkien chose to translate names taken from Beowulf into modern English names such as Grinder, for the Grendel character, Breaker, Ashwood. Unferth from the Beowulf poem is named Unfriend (or Unpeace).\n\nThe main character in Sellic Spell is named Beewolf, a name chosen to connect the character of the hero Beowulf with the concept of a child found alone in a bear-cave, who grows up to be a great warrior, from Hrólfs saga kraka. \n\n==Story and Characters==\n\nBeewolf is remarkable in that he does not use a sword or axe, preferring to wrestle with his foes, until after his victory over Grinder and his mother when he finally accepts the gift of a sword made by Unfriend from the king. \n\nIn Sellic Spell, Beewolf arrives to fight Grinder along with two other warriors: Handshoe and Ashwood, and each in turn takes their place sleeping in the hall.  Handshoe and Ashwood are each slain, but Beewolf, the last of the three to attempt the feat, wrestles Grinder and breaks off his arm. \n\nSellic Spell also departs from the Beowulf version of the story in that in the final revision of Tolkien's tale, Grinder's mother does not come to the hall to avenge her son: instead, Beewolf follows Grinder to his lair and finds her there.  She is described as a hag that fights with spells. \n\n==See also==\n\n*''[[Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary]]''\n*''[[The Saga of Hrolf Kraki]]'', translation by [[Stella M.
