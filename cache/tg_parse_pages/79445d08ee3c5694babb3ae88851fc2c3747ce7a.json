The pillar was extremely tall, rising to the stars, and shone like pale blue crystal. Melko claimed that Helkar and its northern twin [[Ringil (tower)|Ringil]] were made of a strong, imperishable substance that he had devised; in reality he lied for they were made of ice (a material unknown to the other [[Valar]]). Thus, when Aulë's lamps were placed upon them (silver in the north and gold in the south) the ice melted and caused great floods to pour into the seas.<ref>{{LT1|III}}, pp. 69-70</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Helka'' is [[Qenya]] for \"ice-cold\". The [[Gnomish]] cognate was '''''Helchor'''''.<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry \"Helkar\"</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n[[Christopher Tolkien]] noted that the story of the Lamps in its early stage was very different from the published ''[[Silmarillion]]''. It is Melko, not Aulë, who built the two pillars. The name ''Helkar'' disappeared as the name for the southern pillar; eventually the [[Sea of Helcar]] would be the body of water formed at the roots of [[Illuin]], the ''northern'' pillar and lamp. The only remaining influence from the older version of the story was that the fall of the pillars created inland seas, a vestige of the notion that the pillars had been made of ice that melted.<ref>{{LT1|IIIn}}, p. 87</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Towers]]\n[[Category:Qenya locations]]\n\n[[de:Helcar]]\n[[fi:Helcar]]"}}}
