She was called the White Lady of the Noldor; for though her hair was dark, she was pale and clear of hue, and she was ever arrayed in silver and white.|''[[The Later Quenta Silmarillion]]'', \"Of Eldanor and the Princes of the Eldalië\"}}\n\n'''Aredhel''', also called '''Ar-Feiniel''' or the ''White Lady of the Noldor'', was the third child and only daughter of [[Fingolfin]], [[High King of the Noldor]], and [[Anairë]] who herself was also a [[Noldo]]. Her elder brothers were [[Fingon]] and [[Turgon]], and her youngest brother was [[Argon]]. Much later in [[Beleriand]], she became the mother of [[Maeglin]], whose father was [[Eöl]], \"the Dark Elf\".\n\nAredhel was tall and strong, fond of hunting and riding in the forests. Her skin was pale and her hair dark; she always wore silver and white.  She was fond of the sons of [[Fëanor]], especially [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]].\n\n== History ==\nAredhel was born in [[Valinor]] and most likely at [[Tirion]], the city of the [[Noldor]] in [[Aman]]. \n\nWhen she had grown to full stature she was greater and stronger than typical Elf women, and she loved to ride on horse and to hunt in the forests. She was often in the company of the sons of Fëanor.<ref>{{MR|P3I5}}, §42</ref>\n\nIn the flight of the Noldor from Aman, she followed her father Fingolfin and her brothers over the [[Helcaraxë]] to [[Middle Earth]]. But Aredhel's mother Anairë did not go, even though all of her children were going with her husband Fingolfin.\n\nAfter arriving in [[Middle-earth]], she dwelt for a time in [[Nevrast]] where her brother Turgon established the city of [[Vinyamar]]. Later, when Turgon built the hidden city of [[Gondolin]], Aredhel went with her brother and his daughter, Idril, to dwell thereafter in Gondolin. After two hundred years, the longing for the forests and wide lands overcame her and she asked her brother, now [[King Turgon]] of Gondolin, for permission to leave. Nevertheless, Turgon was unwilling at first, because he feared for her safety and for the secrecy of his kingdom. He eventually relented, giving her a small escort of lords among his people for protection. \n\nIgnoring her brother's plea that she would only go to see their eldest brother Fingon, she decided instead to meet the [[Sons of Fëanor]] again. They sought passage through [[Doriath]], but were denied because they were of the Noldor. Aredhel and her companions were then forced to go northward through the treacherous region of [[Nan Dungortheb]] north of Doriath, where they were separated being entangled in the dark shadows. Notwithstanding, Aredhel continued alone onward to [[Himlad]], the land of the Noldorin Elf-lords Celegorm and Curufin where they lived and upon reaching Himlad she only found them away in [[Thargelion]]. \n[[File:Anke Eißmann - Aredhel.jpg|thumb|left|''Aredhel'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]\nAredhel dwelt in Himlad with the people of Celegorm who welcomed her while she waited for Celegorm and Curufin to return. But after awhile, she got tired of waiting for them, and began taking trips of her own to pass the time. It was on one such trip that Aredhel wandered into the dark forest of [[Nan Elmoth]].\n\n[[Eöl]] the [[Dark Elf]] lived there, and upon seeing Aredhel's beauty, wove a spell which caused her to become hopelessly lost and wander ever closer to his home. Eöl revealed himself when she arrived, and welcomed her to his house. They married and had a son named [[Maeglin]]. During this time, Aredhel was free to go where she pleased, with the sole restriction that she couldn't visit any of her kin. Her homesickness led her to tell Maeglin many stories about Gondolin and the Noldor, which only increased her longing for home. Thus, when Maeglin proposed that they abandon Nan Elmoth and return to Gondolin, she responded with pride and joy. \n[[File:Līga Kļaviņa - The Death of Aredhel.jpg|thumb|''The Death of Aredhel'' by [[:Category:Images by Līga Kļaviņa|Līga Kļaviņa]]]]\nWaiting until Eöl was away, the two fled from Nan Elmoth for Gondolin, but were unknowingly tracked by Eöl, who had discovered their disappearance earlier than expected. Aredhel and Maeglin were received with joy in Gondolin, but the guards quickly caught Eöl and brought him to the King on Aredhel's bidding. Turgon was initially willing to spare Eöl and accept him as a kinsman if he remained in Gondolin, but Eöl would not accept this judgement and chose death for himself and Maeglin. He threw a javelin at his son, but Aredhel shielded Maeglin and was wounded. While she lay resting, she spoke to her niece [[Idril]] and begged her to ensure Turgon showed mercy to Eöl. This was not to be, as the weapon Eöl used had been poisoned. Aredhel died shortly after making this final plea, leaving the city and its King bereaved once more.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''Aredhel'' means \"Noble Elf\" in [[Sindarin]].<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 139</ref> Note on pronunciation: ''Aredhel'' should be pronounced ''a-re-thel'' (voiced \"th\", [ð]), not ''a-red-hel''.\n\n== Other names ==\nAredhel's [[Quenya]] name in [[Valinor]] was '''''Írissë''''' correctly rendered in [[Sindarin]] as '''''Íreth''''';<ref>{{PM|XI}}, p. 345</ref> Its second element is the feminine suffix ''-issë'' simply replaced with its Sindarin equivalent ''-eth''. [[Paul Strack]] suggests that her name's initial element seems to be ''írë'' \"desire\" possibly meaning \"''Desirable Lady''\".<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-878386223.html|articlename=Q.

In a c. 1970 note, Tolkien wrote of this name that \"it is now quite unacceptable in form. Unsuitable to the position and character of Turgon's sister, and also meaningless.\"<ref>{{PE|13}}</ref>{{rp|103}} An epithet applied to this name was \"the white-handed\".<ref name=q15>{{SM|Q15}}</ref>\n\nIn a rejected note, Isfin was born in 1469, \"after the making of the Silmarils, and even as the first shadow fell upon the Blessed Realm\".<ref>{{MR|P3I5c}}</ref>{{rp|§42}}\n\nThe names ''Aredhel'' and ''Ar-Feiniel'' (\"noble white lady\") were both originally intended to stand alone, and be used as the main name of ''Irissë''. While preparing ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' for publication, [[Christopher Tolkien]] could not discover which name was intended to be used as her final name, and he therefore chose to use both names: a decision he later stated was possibly mistaken.<ref name=Maeglin>{{WJ|Maeglin}}</ref>{{rp|318}} Another isolated name in the margin was ''Rodwen'', possibly \"High Virgin Noble\", which was apparently descarded by Tolkien.<ref name=Maeglin/>{{rp|317}}\n\nWhile composing the chapter about [[Maeglin]], [[Tolkien]] considered [[Ecthelion]], [[Glorfindel]] and [[Egalmoth]] as the escort of Aredhel in her way to visit [[Fingon]].<ref name=Maeglin />{{rp|318}} However, in the published ''Silmarillion'', Christopher didn't mention any of the escorts of Aredhel, based on a note in which his father considers the motives of Celegorm and Curufin in not sending any message to Gondolin about Aredhel. Tolkien decided that it was necessary ''not'' to name the most eminent and bravest chieftains as Aredhel's escort, as they would have sought for her beyond the [[Iant Iaur]].<ref name=Maeglin />{{rp|328}}\n\nIn ''[[The Grey Annals]]'', Aredhel is recorded as leaving Gondolin in {{FA|316}}, however Tolkien later rejected that while considering the age of Maeglin: \"The date in the Annals is impossible: SY 316. Maeglin would then be about 179 when Tuor came to Gondolin in SY 495; but he would on the 100 : 1 scale be less than 2 years old in life-age!) Gondolin was occupied in SY 116. Isfin therefore cannot have borne Maeglin before, say, 120 – even if she refused entry to Gondolin, not wishing to be “immured”, or escaped soon after Turgon compelled her to enter. So that at best Maeglin would only be 375 years old in SY 495.\"<ref name=aging>{{NM|P1xi}}</ref> \n\nOne of the solutions Tolkien considered while contemplating the age and origin of Maeglin was for him to be born in Aman with his sinister character being \"accounted for by the fact that he (and his mother and father) were specially attracted by Melkor, and grew to dislike Aman, and their kin. They joined the host of Fëanor (this would explain Eöl’s skill in smith-craft!) and were estranged from their immediate kin.\"<ref name=aging/>\n\n{{references|notes}}\n\n[[Category:Calaquendi]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Gondolindrim]]\n[[Category:House of Fingolfin]]\n[[Category:Noldor]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]"}}}
