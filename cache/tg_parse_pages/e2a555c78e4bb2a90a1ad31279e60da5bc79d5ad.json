They ran about 500 miles from east to west. One south-western ridge divided the [[Plateau of Gorgoroth]] from [[Lithlad]]. A shorter southern spur within Gorgoroth ended at [[Barad-dûr]]. The west end of the Ash Mountains met the [[Ephel Dúath|Mountains of Shadow]]. Between the Mountains of Shadow and the Ash Mountains was [[Udûn (valley)|Udûn]].<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>\n\nThe Ered Lithui were rugged and forbidding, described as being composed of \"broken peaks and barren ridges\".

It was expected that the enemy would assault them from the north or northeast, but the Wainriders came directly from the east, using the cover of the Ered Lithui to conceal their approach.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, (i) ''The Northmen and the Wainriders''</ref> The Wainriders were greatly speeded by a long-neglected road that ran from the [[Morannon]] fifty miles to the east.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, note 15</ref>\n\nOn [[5 March]] {{TA|3019|n}},<ref name=\"Great\">{{App|Great}}</ref> [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], and [[Gollum]] looked upon the Ered Lithui before turning aside to journey to [[Ithilien]].<ref name=\"Gate\"/> From [[19 March]] through [[22 March]],<ref name=\"Great\"/> Frodo and Sam crawled slowly east on the road from [[Cirith Gorgor]] to Barad-dûr that hugged the slopes of the Ered Lithui.<ref>{{RK|VI3}}</ref>\n\n==Name and etymology==\n''Ered Lithui'' is a [[Sindarin]] name. It means \"ashen mountains\". It is a compound of ''[[ered]]'', the plural of ''[[orod]]'' (\"mountain\") and ''[[lith]]'' with the adjectival suffix ''ui''.<ref>{{HM|UI}}, p. 457</ref> The name was likely taken from their ash-grey hue.<ref name=\"Nomen\">{{HM|N}}, p. 765</ref>\n\n== Portrayal in adaptations ==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Ered Lithui.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Ered Lithui in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2017: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Ered Lithui are heavily guarded from inside, with a series of fortresses ensuring that nobody can pass unseen.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Mordor]]\n[[Category:Mountain ranges]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[de:Aschengebirge]]\n[[fi:Tuhkavuoret]]"}}}
