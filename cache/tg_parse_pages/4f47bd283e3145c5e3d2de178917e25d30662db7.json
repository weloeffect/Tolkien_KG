place. Eventually, they turned against the [[Valar]], and their island home was destroyed in the last years of the [[Second Age]].\n\n==Origins==\n{{seealso|Edain}}\nThe Númenóreans were descendants of the [[Edain]] of the [[First Age]], who proved themselves great allies of the [[Elves]], from whom they gathered knowledge of all things surrounding them. The two races fought together against [[Morgoth]].\n\nDuring that Age, unions of Elves and Men were made; [[Lúthien]] and [[Beren]] whose son, [[Dior|Dior Eluchíl]], married [[Nimloth of Doriath]] and [[Elwing]] was born. [[Idril]] and [[Tuor]], the second couple, were parents of [[Eärendil]]. Elwing and Eärendil met at the [[Havens of Sirion]] and from their union twins were born: [[Elros]] and [[Elrond]]. To the two [[Half-elven|half-elves]], the Valar gave a choice: Elros chose to join the race of men, whereas Elrond chose to join the elves.\n\nThe Edain fought with the [[Host of Valinor]] in the [[War of Wrath]] and were victorious, the Edain were honoured and blessed by [[Eönwë]] in body and mind for their part in the [[Wars of Beleriand|war]] and the [[Valar]] rewarded the Edain by giving them a place to dwell outside the troubled world of [[Middle-earth]]. [[Ulmo]] raised an island halfway between [[Endor]] and [[Aman]] which the Edain named [[Elenna]], later known as the island of [[Númenor]].<ref name=\"akallabeth\">{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> \n\nThe first ships of the Edain arrived to their new home in {{SA|32}} by following the [[Star of Eärendil]].<ref name=\"Line\" /> The fleet of Elros initially brought probably between 5,000 to 10,000 Edain to the island,<ref name=\"NM\" /> he established the Realm of Númenor and became the first [[King of Númenor]].<ref name=\"Line\" /> After a migration period that lasted at least 50 years, between 200,000 and 350,000 Men (the majority of the Edain in Middle-earth<ref>{{PM|V}}, §5</ref>) had gradually emigrated to Númenor.<ref name=\"NM\">{{NM|P3xiii|}}, p. 339</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Turner Mohan - Númenórean Armor (early Second Age).jpg|thumb|''Númenórean Armor (early Second Age)'' by [[:Category:Images by Turner Mohan|Turner Mohan]]]]\n===Early history===\nThe Númenóreans built a mighty seafaring civilisation, their lore and craft were advanced and enriched by the knowledge of the [[Eldar]] and their body and mind grew in stature, gaining long life thrice more than the Men in [[Middle-earth]].<ref name=\"Line\" /> They excelled in 'ship-building and sea-craft' and became skilled mariners.<ref name=\"akallabeth\" />\n\nThey held the Eldar in close friendship and the white ships from [[Tol Eressëa]] brought many gifts to Númenor such as birds, flowers, and healing herbs. One notable gift was a seedling of [[Celeborn, White Tree|Celeborn]], the White Tree of Tol Eressëa which grew at the courts of the King in [[Armenelos]] and it was named [[Nimloth (tree)|Nimloth]].<ref name=\"akallabeth\" />\n\n===Return to Middle-earth===\nDue to the fact that the [[Ban of the Valar]] restricted them from sailing [[Undying Lands|West]], the Númenóreans began to explore the eastern part of the [[Arda|world]], reaching the shores of Middle-earth in {{SA|600}}.<ref name=\"APSA\">{{App|SA}}</ref> They sailed to [[Lindon]] and established a friendship with [[Gil-galad]] and the [[Elves of Lindon]].<ref name=\"UTAE3\" />\n\nThe Men in [[Eriador]] were filled with wonder at their coming for the Men of Middle-earth had long lived under the [[Shadow]], a period known as the [[Dark Years]], and because of this they grew weak and fearful. The Númenóreans began to cultivate their new friends teaching them agriculture, stonemasonry and smithying.<ref name=\"akallabeth\" /> They also discovered that while their languages were different, they both had a common origin and were able to converse with each other over simple matters.<ref name=\"UTAE3\">{{UT|4}}, note 3</ref> The Númenóreans never dwelt long in the shores of Middle-earth, but the [[Middle Men|Men]], who populated the western shores, were comforted. They revered the memory of the tall Sea-kings whom they remembered as gods hoping each time for their return.<ref name=\"akallabeth\" />\n[[Image:Eric Faure-Brac - Erendis.jpg|thumb|250px|left|''Erendis'' by Eric Faure-Brac]]\nIn the following decades there was increased activity between Númenór and Middle-earth, mariners returning from their voyages brought with them ore and jewels. In {{SA|750}} the [[Guild of Venturers]] was founded by [[Aldarion]] and many young and eager men joined.<ref>{{UT|4}}, Notes, Chronology</ref> Their vessels grew greater and larger and were now able to make far and long voyages. \n\nAldarion established [[Vinyalondë]] at the mouth of the [[Gwathló]], a haven for the purpose of repairs, ship building and collection of timber. The Númenóreans began to escalate their tree felling around the dense forests of [[Minhiriath]] and [[Enedwaith]], but their enterprise created animosity between them and the [[Pre-Númenóreans|native men]] living there and the forest-dwellers attacked and ambushed the Númenóreans when they could until they were expelled from their forest homes. The Númenóreans wrecked the banks, the shorelines, great tracks and roads whom they drove into the forests northwards and southwards from the Gwathló and continued battling and destroying what lied ahead of them, pushing into Minhiriath and Enedwaith.<ref name=\"UTLD\">{{UT|6d}}</ref>\n\nIn {{SA|882}} Gil-galad warned [[Tar-Meneldur]] that a new shadow is rising in the East, instigated by a [[Sauron|servant]] of [[Morgoth]], and asked for aid when the time comes to help defend Eriador against this new threat.<ref name=\"Aldarion\">{{UT|Aldarion}}</ref>{{rp|199–200}} The Númenóreans began the preparation of force and supplies for war.<ref name=\"CGC\">{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>\n\nA millennium after the foundation of the Realm, the population seemed to have slightly exceeded 2 million Númenóreans.<ref name=\"NM\" />\n\nIn the early [[Second Age 1200|thirteenth century]] of the Second Age, the Númenóreans began establishing permanent settlements in Middle-earth.<ref name=\"APSA\" /> Later these settlements were under increased pressure from raiders as [[Sauron]] drew closer to the Númenórean sphere of influence. He recruited the [[Pre-Númenóreans|natives]] that had a hatred of Númenór and used them as spies and guides. Though Sauron had not enough force to assault the forts at the Haven or along the banks of the Gwathló his raiders wreaked havoc on the fringes of the forests, burning trees and wood-stores of the Númenóreans.<ref name=\"UTLD\" />\n\nThe Númenóreans participated in the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]], though they arrived late to the conflict in {{SA|1700}}<ref name=\"APSA\" /> due to delays<ref name=\"CGC\" /> and when most of Eriador was already ruined. [[Tar-Minastir]]'s fleet turned the tide of the war and Sauron was decisively defeated in the [[Battle of the Gwathló]]. Sauron was forced to retreat to [[Mordor]] and vowed vengeance upon the Númenóreans and there was peace in the [[Westlands]].<ref name=\"CGC\" />\n\n===Shadow falls===\n[[File:Turner Mohan - Númenórean Armor (late Second Age).jpg|thumb|''Númenórean Armor (late Second Age)'' by [[:Category:Images by Turner Mohan|Turner Mohan]]]]\nThe first sign of the Shadow falling upon Númenór was said to have begun in the reign of Tar-Minastir, he loved the Eldar - and aided them in their most desperate hour against Sauron - but he also envied them.<ref name=\"Line\" /> Over time, the Númenóreans began questioning the [[Ban of the Valar]] and the [[Gift of Men]], and the fear of death crept into their hearts, so the [[Firstborn]] became envied for their immortality.<ref name=\"akallabeth\" />\n\nAbout {{SA|1800}}, the Númenóreans began establishing dominions on the coasts of Middle-earth and their attitude towards the Men of Middle-earth changed, where once they were teachers and friends they now subjugated them and levied heavy tribute to the native populace, desiring wealth and power. This occurred during the reigns of [[Tar-Ciryatan]] and his son [[Tar-Atanamir]].<ref name=\"APSA\" /> It was during the reign of Tar-Atanamir that the Shadow upon Númenór was on its noontide. The Númenóreans that followed his lore spoke openly against the [[Valar]] and Eldar<ref name=\"Line\" /> though they still feared retaliation from the Valar if they broke the ban.<ref name=\"akallabeth\" />\n\nDuring the reign of [[Tar-Ancalimon]], the Númenóreans became divided into two parties; the [[Faithful]] or [[Elf-friends]] and the [[King's Men]].<ref name=\"Line\" /> Those that followed the King abandoned the use of the [[Eldarin]] tongues and were estranged from the Eldar and Valar while the Faithful were still friends with the Eldar.<ref name=\"APNK\">{{App|A1i}}</ref> The King's Men explored the coasts of Middle-earth far southward, establishing landing and trading posts that grew into cruel vice-kingdoms which left many rumours in the legends of Men, although the Eldar did not know about them,<ref>{{PM|Akallabeth}}, §28</ref> such as [[Umbar]].<ref group=\"note\">It is unclear when Umbar was founded, in [[Appendix B]] of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' it is mentioned that it was fortified in {{SA|2280}} which means that it had existed in some form prior to that date.</ref> The Faithful Númenóreans played no part in this and in {{SA|2350}} [[Pelargir]] was built by them and it became their chief haven.<ref name=\"APSA\" />\n\nWhen [[Ar-Adûnakhôr]] ascended to the throne in {{SA|2899}},<ref name=\"APSA\" /> he was the first king to choose an [[Adûnaic]] name and began to persecute the Faithful, punishing all those who would speak the Elven tongues openly. In the end, the Eldar came no more to the land of Númenor.<ref name=\"APNK\" /> However there was some respite for the Faithful under the rule of [[Tar-Palantir]] who sought to repent the actions of his predecessors and gain back the favour of the Valar.<ref name=\"Line\" />\n\n[[Tar-Palantir]]'s policies were met with opposition by his brother [[Gimilkhâd]] who led the King's party, when he died his son [[Pharazôn]] returned to Númenór and led a rebellion against the king. When Tar-Palantir died his daughter [[Tar-Míriel|Míriel]], according to the [[Law of Succession in Númenor|New Law]], had the right to inherit the throne, but Pharazôn forced her into marriage, and usurped the [[Sceptre of Númenor|Sceptre]] for himself, becoming known as Ar-Pharazôn.<ref name=\"akallabeth\" />\n\n===Sauron's corruption===\nIn {{SA|3261}}<ref name=\"APSA\" /> Ar-Pharazôn returned to Middle-earth with a mighty host to challenge the threat of Sauron. So mighty were the Númenóreans that the servants of Sauron fled even before the battle began and their leader was taken as a prisoner back to the island of Elenna. Through numerous lies he poisoned the mind of the king and became master of his council, changing even the religion of the Númenóreans and turning them into servants of the dark lord [[Morgoth]].<ref name=\"akallabeth\" />\n\n===Downfall===\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Queen Tar-Míriel and the Great Wave.jpg|thumb|left|''Queen Tar-Miriel and the Great Wave'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\n{{main|Downfall of Númenor}}\nAs the shadow of death approached Ar-Pharazôn Sauron now urged the king to take immortality by force and invade Aman. The Númenóreans now began preparations for war with the Valar and this raised the anger of [[Manwë]] who sent his eagle-shaped storm clouds to Númenor. Lightning struck the land, including the temple of Melkor, where human sacrifices were made. Because Sauron himself stood in their path and was not hurt by them, the Númenóreans were deceived even more into thinking he was their rightful god.<ref name=\"akallabeth\" />\n\nAr-Pharazôn sailed at the head of his fleet known as the [[Great Armament]], led by the flagship [[Alcarondas]], set course towards Valinor and reached Tol Eressëa. His pride fooled him into thinking that the inhabitants of Aman would not stand in his way, because the land was quiet and peaceful, and thus he set camp near the [[Túna]] hill. But Manwë, the Elder King, was aware of what transpired, and the Valar then laid down the Guardianship of Arda. Ilúvatar responded by catastrophically changing the shape of Arda. The Númenóreans present in Valinor were buried under the hills which fell upon them, and on the great island, fire erupted from the top of [[Meneltarma]]. The land crumbled into pieces and a great wave swept over it and buried the island at the bottom of the sea. Its people were taken by the waters, and this tragedy brought an end to the Númenórean realm, in {{SA|3319}}.<ref name=\"akallabeth\" />\n\n===Legacy===\n[[File:Turner Mohan - Out Of The Sea I Am Come.jpg|thumb|200px|''Out Of The Sea I am Come'' by Turner Mohan]]\nFew of the remaining Númenóreans in the island survived the Downfall, these were the Elendili led by Elendil and his sons, [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]]. They escaped the [[Akallabêth]] with nine ships, a seedling of [[Nimloth of Númenor|Nimloth]], which Isildur had rescued the night before its destruction and the Seven [[Seeing-stones]]. Cast ashore by the storm on the western lands of Middle-earth, they founded the Númenórean realms in exile: [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]].<ref name=\"akallabeth\" />\n\nOther Númenóreans survived the Downfall who had settled in Middle-earth, such as the Faithful [[House of Dol Amroth]].<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, Note 39</ref> The King's Men of Middle-earth continued to serve Sauron and were later known as the [[Black Númenóreans]]. Their chief haven was [[Umbar]].<ref name=\"Rings\">{{S|Rings}}</ref>\n\nLong after the Fall, there was a belief among those who survived it that the Holy Mountain Meneltarma was not swallowed by the waters but instead raised to be a new island of its own. The heirs of Elendil built great ships once more and set on its search, not only because they yearned for their home, but also because from that point, the top of Meneltarma, Tol Eressëa could be spotted and their hearts still desired to reach the West, against all warnings. But they never found the top of Meneltarma and their voyages served only to discover that Arda was now a round world and their ships could not reach Aman any more.<ref name=\"akallabeth\" />\n\n==Culture==\n===Language===\nThe Númenóreans spoke [[Adûnaic]], a [[Mannish]] language that descended from the Mannish languages spoken in [[Beleriand]]. However, their forefathers, the Edain, had learned [[Sindarin]] which was passed on to Númenor. As a language of lore, it changed only a little with the millennia. Educated Númenóreans also studied [[Quenya]], having a prestige above all other tongues.<ref name=\"Appendices\">{{App|Men}}</ref>\n\n===Religion and tradition===\n[[File:Liz Danforth - Isildur.png|thumb|200px|left|''[[Isildur]]'' by Liz Danforth]]\nTowards the middle of Mittalmar stood the Mountain [[Meneltarma]], the sacred place on which [[Ilúvatar|Eru]] was worshipped. Its flattened top was wide enough to contain a great crowd during the three yearly ceremonies ([[Erukyermë]], [[Erulaitalë]] and [[Eruhantalë]]). These took place in absolute silence while climbing its slopes. Soon after {{SA|3262}} these religious beliefs were abandoned and the worshipping of [[Morgoth|Melkor]] began. It was done in a cylindrical temple near the city of Armenelos built especially for this, and it involved sacrificing men and women over a great fire, whose first flames were lit from the logs of [[Nimloth the Fair]], white tree of Númenor, when Sauron ordered it felled.\n\nEvery autumn they observed the [[Great Bear-dance]].<ref name=\"NOME\">{{NM|P3xiii}}, p. 335</ref>\n\nWhenever ships sailed from Númenor, the custom of the [[Green Bough of Return]] took place. A branch from the [[Fragrant Trees|Fragrant Tree]] [[Oiolairë]] was set at the prow as a symbol of good fortune by a Númenórean woman, close relative to the captain of the ship. [[Erendis]], wife of Tar-Aldarion, refused to do so in disagreement with her husband's frequent voyages towards Middle-earth, breaking this tradition for the first time.\n\n===Daily life===\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Númenórean helmet.jpg|thumb|Númenórean helmet by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]\nMany of the inhabitants of Númenor were fishermen. Along with the grains cultivated in Orrostar, fish was the main food source for the Númenóreans.\n\nThe Dúnedain were skilled in riding and loved horses. They could even call them in their thoughts if bound by friendship. Númenor had no paved roads so that the carriages could move on them more easily. From the [[Noldor]] they learned the art of forging swords, axes, spears, knives, but mostly bows; their arrows resembled dark clouds falling upon the enemies. \n\nThe Númenóreans, were skilled in the art of husbandry, breeding great horses that roamed across the open plains in Mittalmar. \n\nThe greatest love of the Númenóreans was the sea and the building of the largest ships. Most were built at the command of Tar-Aldarion, who also established the [[Guild of Venturers]]. The ship ''[[Eämbar]]'' was their headquarters.\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Turner Mohan - Tar-Míriel.jpg|thumb|''Tar-Míriel'' by [[:Category:Images by Turner Mohan|Turner Mohan]]]]\nThe average Númenórean was taller than two [[Ranga]]r or 6'4\". Elendil was the tallest of Men who escaped the Downfall, mentioned to be almost 2.5 [[rangar]] tall, 7'11\" or 2.41 m.<ref>{{UT|Linear}}</ref>\n\nNúmenóreans were granted especially long lives when compared to that of other Men, with the average lifespan in the beginning ranging from 350 years to as much as 420. Those of the line of Elros in particular often lived 400 years or even more, while those who were outside of the royal line only rarely managed to reach 400.<ref name=\"Life\">{{NM|P3xi}}, p. 317</ref>\n\nNúmenóreans were also those who best understood the [[Gift of Ilúvatar]] and were blessed in that they did not share the same fear of death that other men had. Often in the beginning of Númenor, Men who at last began to feel the first signs of weariness of mortal life would voluntarily give up their spirits and die of their own free will. This usually would only occur in the latter years of their lifespan, such as around year 400 for the particularly long lived.<ref name=\"Life\" />\n\nHowever, as part of the decay brought on by the Shadow, many Númenóreans began to fear death rather than accept it. During the twilight of the realm, many Númenóreans would cling to life for as long as possible, becoming senile and decrepit like other Men. Additionally, lifespans began to decline as the Shadow further grew. The lifespans of those of the house of Elros began to fall to the point where many would live for less than three centuries.<ref name=\"Line\" />\n\n==Other names==\nIn their own language, the Númenóreans were named '''''Adûnâi'''''.<ref>{{SD|66}}, p. 247</ref>\n\nThey were also known as '''High Men'''; '''''Tarkildi''''' in Quenya.<ref name=\"Dwarves\" />{{rp|312, 427}}<ref name=\"Appendices\" /><ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 101</ref> (Cf. [[Middle Men]]). They were also known as \"Sea-kings\", \"Men of the Sea\" and \"Lords of the Sea\".<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 297</ref>\n\nIn [[Quenya]] they were known as '''''Núnatani''''' (\"Western Men\") as well, and '''''Dúnedain''''' in [[Sindarin]].<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 18</ref> ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' is explicit in noting that \"Númenóreans\" and \"Dúnedain\" are synonymous terms, meaning the same thing. Nevertheless, it seems more usual to call those born in [[Númenor]] \"Númenóreans\" and their descendants living in [[Middle-earth]] post-[[Downfall of Númenor|Downfall]] \"Dúnedain\".\n\nThey were known as '''''Go-hilleg''''' by the [[Dunlendings]].<ref>{{PM|Index}}, entry \"Go-hilleg\"</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn the earlier drafts of the ''Akallabêth'', it introduced the notion of the Númenóreans using aerial craft.<ref>{{LR|P1II1}}</ref> After the destruction of their island they devise ships that 'sail in the air of breath'.<ref>{{LR|P1II2}}, §12</ref> The mechanics is not explored and was discarded in the story later.<ref>{{LR|P1II2}}, Commentary on the first version of The Fall of Númenor, §12</ref>\n\n[[Christopher Tolkien]] noted that Tolkien developed his thinking on the longevity of Númenóreans: originally he suggested that Númenóreans not of the [[Line of Elros]] lived for 200 years - or three times normal men - with royal kindred living 400 years. However, in later writings this was changed to a smaller difference between royals and non-royals, with Númenóreans living \"five times\" that of normal men, or 300–350 years. Those of the House of Elros were consistenly at c. 400 years, although this was later diminished due to their rebellion.<ref name=\"Line\" /> This longer lifespan resulted in an older age of adulthood: 25 years.<ref name=\"Aldarion\" />{{rp|174}}\n\nIn another writing from circa 1965, Tolkien postulated that even Númenóreans who were not of the royal house lived around 350–420 years, though non royals managing to reach 400 was not a common event.<ref name=\"Life\" />\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Rings of Power (TV series) - Númenóreans.jpg|thumb|Númenórean characters as seen in ''The Rings of Power'']]\n:'''2022: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'', Season One:'''\n:Several Númenórean characters appear from [[Adar (episode)|episode 3]] forward. As the production has license to utilize material only from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', other sources such as ''[[Akallabêth]]'', which provide more details on the Númenóreans, can't be used. As such, particular Númenórean characteristics, such as high stature and longevity, or their concerns about immortality or collonialist expansion aren't taken into consideration. The Númenórean people is portrayed as easy to influence, turning from a hatred towards [[Elves]] (unexplained on screen), represented by [[Galadriel]], to join battle under the command of her.\n\n==See also==\n*[[King of Númenor]]\n*[[Black Númenóreans]]\n*[[Dúnedain]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.stephenwigmore.com/2016/09/the-population-of-numenor-through-2nd.html The population of Númenor] - A theory about the Númenóreans's population numbers on Númenor and Middle-earth during the Second Age, by Stephen Wigmore\n*[http://www.zarkanya.net/Tolkien/Decline%20of%20the%20Numenoreans.htm Decline of the Lifespan of the Númenóreans] - Discussion about the lifespan of Númenórean characters, both on Númenor and the Realms in Exile, with visual charts.\n{{references|n}}\n[[Category:Edain]]\n[[Category:Men]]\n[[Category:Númenóreans]]\n[[fi:Númenorilaiset]]\n[[fr:encyclo/peuples/hommes/numenoreens]]"}}}
