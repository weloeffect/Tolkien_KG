Known particularly for his fairy tales and fantasy novels, George MacDonald inspired authors such as [[W.H. Auden]], [[C.S. Lewis]] , [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[G.K. Chesterton]] and [[Charles Williams]]. He is therefore often referred to as the \"grandfather\" of the [[Inklings]].<ref>Gisela Kreglinger, \"MacDonald, George (1824–1905)\", in ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia: Scholarship and Critical Assessment]]''</ref>\n\n==Tolkien's views on MacDonald==\n===Early admiration===\n[[Humphrey Carpenter]] wrote that several stories of MacDonald's had been Tolkien's \"childhood favourites\", especially having been fond of ''[[Wikipedia:The Princess and the Goblin|The Princess and the Goblin]]'' and ''[[Wikipedia:The Princess and Curdie|The Princess and Curdie]]''.<ref>[[Humphrey Carpenter]], ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]''</ref> Tolkien also introduced ''The Princess and the Goblin'' to his children.<ref>{{HM|OFS}}</ref>\n\n===Influences===\n{{quote|\"Trust the Oak,\" said she; \"trust the Oak, and the Elm, and the great Beech. Take care of the Birch, for though she is honest, she is too young not to be changeable. But shun the Ash and the Alder; for the Ash is an ogre,—you will know him by his thick fingers; and the Alder will smother you with her web of hair, if you let her near you at night.\"|''Phantastes'', Chapter III}}\n\nIn one of MacDonald's most renowned novels, ''[[Phantastes]]'', the protagonist, while travelling in 'Fairy Land', is faced with animate trees. Tolkien remarked in a [[Letter to L.M. Cutts|letter]] that this notion had \"''perhaps some remote influence''\" on his creation of the [[Ents]].<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], \"[[Letter to L.M. Cutts]]\" (letter), ''[[Sotheby's English Literature, History, Fine Bindings, Private Press Books, Children's Books, Illustrated Books and Drawings 10 July 2003]]''</ref>\n\n===Later criticism===\nIn 1964, Tolkien was asked to write a preface to an American edition of MacDonald's short story ''[[The Golden Key]]''. While accepting the commission, for the reason that he thought \"''well of this story of his''\", Tolkien never finished the preface, and wrote in a letter to the publishers that ''\"I am not as warm an admirer of George MacDonald as C.S. Lewis was\"''<ref>{{L|262}}</ref> (Lewis, more explicitly and warmly than Tolkien, thought highly of MacDonald, writing that \"''I have never concealed the fact that I regarded George MacDonald as my master''\"<ref>Quoted in George MacDonald, ''The Complete Fairy Tales'' (Penguin Classics, 2000)</ref>).\n\nIn \"An Interview with Tolkien\", Henry Resnick (Niekas Issue 18, 1967) Tolkien said: ''As a matter of fact, insofar as... without harping or preaching on the side of various rather old-fashioned things like humility, valor, and so on... and courage, you can carry [on] those over and I think it has rather an effect on people — young folks are ready in their attitudes to rather be changed. But I didn't intend these things, because I didn't write it for children. That's why I don't like George MacDonald very much; he's a horrible old grandmother. That's a very find woman figure, of course, really — the Queen is rather a mother''.\n\n[[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] have argued that Tolkien, when re-reading \"The Golden Key\" and other of MacDonald's works for the preparation of the foreword, apparently reconsidered his former admiration on the grounds that the stories often contained a narrator's voice and too much of moral lecturing reminding of the literary style of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' (a style which Tolkien had regretted later in life). Hammond and Scull further quote from a manuscript, held at the [[Bodleian Library]], where Tolkien writes that \"''a highly selective memory had retained only a few impressions of things that moved me, and re-reading G[eorge] M[acDonald] critically filled with me distaste''\".<ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]], ''[[The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide]]: Reader's Guide'', pp.570-1</ref>\n\n==Bibliography, selected==\n*1858: ''[[Phantastes|Phantastes: A Faerie Romance for Men and Women]]''\n*1864: ''Adela Cathcart'' (includes the short story ''The Giant's Heart'')\n*[[1867]]: ''Dealings with the Fairies'' (includes the short story ''[[The Golden Key]]'')\n*[[1872]]: ''[[Wikipedia:The Princess and the Goblin|The Princess and the Goblin]]''\n*[[1883]]: ''[[Wikipedia:The Princess and Curdie|The Princess and Curdie]]''\n*[[1895]]: ''[[Wikipedia:Lilith|Lilith]]''\n\n==External links==\n*{{WP|George MacDonald}}\n*[http://dimitrafimi.com/george-macdonald-and-one-of-tolkiens-most-quotable-lines/ George MacDonald and one of Tolkien’s most quotable lines] by [[Dimitra Fimi]]\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:MacDonald, George}}\n[[Category:Authors]]\n[[Category:British people]]\n[[Category:People by name]]\n[[Category:Religious workers]]"}}}
