Its emblem was a golden trout on a blue field. During the [[War of the Ring]], the elderly \"Lord Borhador\" ruled from the Crossing-Hall in [[Ethring]], the only settlement. He was assisted by his other son \"Arvaethor\" in [[Dervorin]]'s absence. The Vale was threatened by [[spiders]], [[White Mountains|White Mountain]] [[Orcs]], [[Corsairs of Umbar|Corsair]] scouts, and the twice-traitorous [[Oathbreakers]] known as the Ruthless Dead. Southwest of Ethring was the [[Warning beacons of Gondor|beacon]] of \"Eilendoth\".\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ringlo Vale}}\n[[Category:Gondor]]\n[[Category:Valleys]]\n\n[[de:Ringló-Tal]]\n[[fi:Ringlón laakso]]"}}}
