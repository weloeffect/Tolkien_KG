It is preceded by ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' and ''[[The Two Towers]]''. ''The Return of the King'' was originally released on [[20 October]] [[1955]] in the United Kingdom. After the high demand of the previous volumes, this was released in significantly more copies (7000 in the UK and 5000 in the US).<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. xxxv</ref>\n\nThe volume is divided into two books, Book V and VI. The [[The Lord of the Rings Appendices|Appendices]] are included in the end.\n\n==Title and structure==\nTolkien conceived of ''The Lord of the Rings'' as a single work comprising six sections he called \"books\" and extensive appendices. The original publisher made the decision to split the work into three parts, publishing the fifth and sixth books and the appendices in the final volume. For the two final \"books\" Tolkien suggested the titles ''[[The War of the Ring]]'' and ''[[The End of the Third Age]]'', which however weren't used in publication; but in the case of the third volume, he suggested '''''[[The War of the Ring]]''''' or '''''The Return of the King'''''.<ref name=l136>{{L|136}}</ref>\n\nThe chosen title refers to [[Aragorn]]'s assumption of the throne. Tolkien criticised it as giving away less of the story; but he was overruled by his publishers.\n\n;Structure\nThe structure of ''The Return of the King'' mirrors somewhat that of ''The Two Towers'' in that the first section recounts the various adventures of several characters including a massive battle, and the second section resumes the quest of the [[Ring-bearers]].\n\n==Synopsis — Book V==\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - The Return of the King.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Tolkien's preliminary design for the dust-jacket of ''The Return of the King''.]]\nThe story begins as [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] is in [[Rohan]], reunited with the remnants of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]]. He steals [[Saruman]]'s ''[[Palantíri|palantír]]'' and sees that [[Sauron]] will attack [[Minas Tirith]]. Then [[Gandalf]] delivers news to the [[Denethor|steward of Gondor]] that war is imminent.\n\nGandalf brings Pippin with him, who enters the service of the steward. Aragorn by his courage and leadership proves himself a worthy ruler of [[Men]]. He is destined to find a [[Oathbreakers|lost army]] of men now dead yet entrapped in a curse set forth long ago by their own disobedience, in the place known as the [[Paths of the Dead]].\n\nThe remnants of the Fellowship lead the forces of Gondor and Rohan in defence of Gondor's capital city, Minas Tirith, resulting in the cataclysmic [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. Those characters that manage to survive the battle are led by Aragorn on a assuredly suicidal feint-attack against the [[Black Gate]] of [[Mordor]], partly to distract Sauron from defending his other borders so that [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] can gain a clear passage into Mordor. Aragorn's company now surrounds the Black Gates of the Morannon exchanging idle words with the [[Mouth of Sauron]].\n\n===Book V chapters===\n[[File:J.R.R.

This happens when Frodo at the last moment decides to keep the ring rather than destroy it, and is attacked by Gollum who bites off Frodo's finger to take the ring, trips, and falls into the lava while still holding the ring. Frodo and Sam are rescued by the giant [[Eagles]] who Gandalf rides to Mount Doom, from the Black Gates of Morannon. After Sauron is defeated, his armies at the Black Gates flee, and the men of Gondor and Rohan are victorious in the battle.\n\nAragorn is crowned [[High King]] of the [[Reunited Kingdom]] at Minas Tirith.
