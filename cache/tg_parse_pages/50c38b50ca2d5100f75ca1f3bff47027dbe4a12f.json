This scene was not featured in the theatrical release of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\n[[Frodo]] and [[Sam]] are at a camping site in the forest in the evening. While Sam is cooking food over a fire, they hear [[Wood-elves]] singing in the distance and run to see them. The Elves are walking in a solemn procession on their way to the [[Grey Havens]]. Sam says it makes him sad that the Elves are leaving Middle-earth.\n\nLater, when Frodo and Sam have bedded down for the night, Sam complains about lying on the ground among tree roots, to Frodo's amusement.\n\nA [[Black Rider]] is briefly seen in an empty landscape of the [[Shire]]. In the theatrical edition of the film, this shot was included in [[The Shadow of the Past (scene)|The Shadow of the Past]].\n\n==Differences==\n\nThis scene is not directly based on anything in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', but may be inspired by the episode in the chapter [[Three is Company]] in which Frodo and his companions  meet a party of wood-elves led by [[Gildor]].<ref>{{FR|Three}}</ref> It is also said that Sam \"believed he had once seen an Elf in the woods.\"<ref>{{FR|Shadow}}</ref> There is also a reference to the discomfort of sleeping on the ground: \"Frodo woke up first, and found that a tree-root had made a hole in his back, and that his neck was stiff.\"<ref>{{FR|Three}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n{{title}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring scenes|11]]"}}}
