The Rushdown then continued 25 miles southeastward until its confluence with the Anduin roughly halfway between the [[Langwell]]-[[Greylin]] confluence and the [[Carrock]].<ref>{{FR|Map}}</ref> Given the name \"Rushdown\" it probably had a steep gradient.\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nThe river Rhimdath is unnamed on the [[Map of Wilderland]] in the ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[The Third Map of The Lord of the Rings]]'', the [[General Map of Middle-earth]] and [[The West of Middle-earth at the End of the Third Age]] map. \n\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] added the names \"''Rhimdath''\" and \"Rushdown\" in pencil on the [[Map of Wilderland]] in one of his copies of ''[[The Hobbit]]''.<ref name=RS>{{RS|1XIc}}, footnote †, p. 205</ref> He also added the names \"R.Rushdown\" and \"(Rhimdad)\" on [[The First Map of The Lord of the Rings]].<ref>{{TI|MII}}, map square J-12, p. 305</ref> The name \"Rushdown\" also appears on a late map of the northern part of Middle-earth drawn by J.R.R.

The first element in ''Rhimdath'' is related to [[Noldorin]] ''[[rhib-]]'', ''[[rhimp]]'', ''rhimmo'' (\"to flow like a [?torrent]\"), derived from the [[Sundocarme|stem]] [[RIP|RIP-]] (\"rush, fly, fling\").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry '''RIP-''', p. 384</ref> As the stem [[DAT|DAT-]] is glossed as \"fall down\",<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 354</ref> it is possible that the second element in ''Rhimdath'' is a derivative of this stem.<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-3656807887.html|articlename=N.

The lake is home to \"Lyndelby\", a village of [[Fallohides]] that remains isolated from the larger world and is protected by the [[Great Eagles]] who maintain its secret.\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Noldorin locations]]\n[[Category:Rhovanion]]\n[[Category:Rivers]]"}}}
