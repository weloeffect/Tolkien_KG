However, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] later changed his mind, and did not disclose his name in the book nor gave him any dialogue.\n\n== Etymology ==\nAnar, or ''Anarr'', is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. His name most likely means \"the Other\" or \"Starer\".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, \"Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion\", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n{{title}}\n[[Category:Dwarves]]\n[[Category:Dwarven names]]\n[[Category:Norse names]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]"}}}
