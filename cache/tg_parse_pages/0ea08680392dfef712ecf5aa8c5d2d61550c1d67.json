It contained [[Valinor]], the home of the [[Valar]], and [[Eldamar]], the kingdom of the [[Calaquendi]].\n \n==Description==\n[[File:Steven White Jr. - Valinor.gif|150px|thumb|Map of Aman by [[User:Smeagol|Steven White Jr.]]]]\n===Geography===\nThe continent of Aman had great oceans on both sides, [[Ekkaia]] to the west and [[Belegaer]] to the east.  When the Valar chose this land for their dwelling they needed a defence against [[Melkor]] and thus upon Aman's [[Haerast|eastern coast]] they raised the [[Pelóri]], the highest mountains on earth, of which [[Taniquetil]] was the tallest of all.  Upon this peak were the thrones of [[Manwë]] and [[Varda]].\n \nBehind the mountain wall was established the domain of [[Valinor]] which became more beautiful than Middle-earth in the [[Spring of Arda]]. \n \nThrough the Pelóri was opened a pass, the [[Calacirya]], which brought light to the narrow coastland of [[Eldamar]] and the island of [[Tol Eressëa]].<ref name=\"Eldamar\">{{S|Princes}}</ref>  Also beyond the mountain wall were two more regions of Aman: [[Araman]] to the northeast<ref name=\"Flight\">{{S|Flight}}</ref> and [[Avathar]] to the southeast. On the shores of Araman there was a land of mist called [[Oiomúrë]], which [[Fingolfin]] passed through during the [[flight of the Noldor]], and [[Ungoliant]] had managed to escape notice in Avathar.<ref>{{S|Darkening}}</ref> \n \nIn the north Aman was separated from Middle-earth by the narrow straits of the [[Helcaraxë]].  These ice-filled straits served as a path for Melkor and later the host of [[Fingolfin]] to return to Middle-earth.<ref name=\"Flight\"/>\n \nThe Valar later set the [[Enchanted Isles]] in the ocean to prevent travelers by sea from reaching Aman.<ref name=\"Sun\">{{S|Sun}}</ref>\n\n===Flora and fauna===\nThe ''[[olvar]]'' (plants) and ''[[kelvar]]'' (animals) in Aman were sometimes different from those of Middle-earth, though they were in essence \"ordinary beasts and plants with usual conditions of mortality\".<ref>{{ER|R2}}, p. 150</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Aman.mp3|Ardamir}}\nThe [[Quenya]] name ''Aman'' is glossed as \"Blessed Land\",<ref name=VT49>{{VT|49a}}, pp. 26-7</ref> or \"blessed, free from evil\"<ref>{{WJ|P4}}, p. 399</ref> or \"The Unmarred State\".<ref>{{LT1|IIIn}}</ref> \n\nThe etymology of the name ''Aman'' changed over time in [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s writings. In early linguistic writings, ''Aman'' was intended to be a \"native [[Quenya]] form\", derived from the root MAN (\"good\"). However, in later writings (such as ''[[Quendi and Eldar]]''), the name is said to derive from a [[Valarin]] word.<ref name=VT49/>\n\n===Other names===\nIts [[Sindarin]] name was '''''Avon''''' (\"Unmarred State\").<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 162</ref>\n\nAman was also called the Ancient West,<ref>{{S|IV}}</ref> Blessed Realm<ref>{{S|Index}}, entries \"Aman\" and \"Blessed Realm\"</ref> and the [[Undying Lands]]<ref>{{App|Numenor}}</ref> or just [[Valinor]]. In [[Adûnaic]] it was called '''''Amatthāni'''''.<ref>{{SD|Footnotes}}, p. 435</ref> In ''[[The Hobbit]]'' Tolkien also calls this continent \"Faerie in the West\".<ref>{{H|Flies}}</ref>\n\n==Immortality==\n[[Robert Foster]] said in his foreword to ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'' that he did not provide death dates for protagonists who sailed in the West \"''for they still live''\". Steuard Jensen, while noting that Tolkien \"''seems to have been initially unsure''\" if the \"''mortals who sailed to the West would remain mortal''\", comments that there are strong arguments in favour of the opposite view, citing from two letters by Tolkien:<ref>{{webcite|author=Steuard Jensen|articleurl=http://tolkien.slimy.com/faq/History.html#MortalsWest|articlename=Did Frodo and the other mortals who passed over the Sea eventually die?|dated=|website=FAQ|accessed=25 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|...certain 'mortals', who have played some great part in Elvish affairs, may pass with the Elves to Elvenhome...I have said nothing about it in this book [''The Lord of the Rings''], but the mythical idea underlying is that for mortals, since their 'kind' cannot be changed for ever, this is strictly only a temporary reward: a healing and redress of suffering.  They cannot abide for ever, and though they cannot return to mortal earth, they can and will 'die' - of free will, and leave the world.|[[Letter 154]]}}\n\n{{blockquote|Frodo was sent or allowed to pass over Sea to heal him - if that could be done, before he died. He would have eventually to 'pass away': no mortal could, or can, abide for ever on earth, or within Time.|[[Letter 246]]}}\n\nOther important arguments against the immortality of the mortals who sailed to Aman can be found in another letter and in a passage from ''[[The Akallabêth]]'':\n\n{{blockquote|As for ''Frodo'' or other mortals, they could only dwell in ''Aman'' for a limited time - whether brief or long. The ''Valar'' had neither the power nor the right to confer 'immortality' upon them. Their sojourn was a 'purgatory', but one of peace and healing and they would eventually pass away (''die'' at their own desire and of free will) to destinations of which the Elves knew nothing.\"|[[Letter 325]]}}\n\n{{blockquote|The Eldar reported these words to the Valar, and Manwë was grieved, seeing a cloud gather on the noontide of Númenor. And he sent messengers to the Dúnedain, who spoke earnestly to the King, and to all who would listen, concerning the fate and fashion of the world.<br/><br/>‘The Doom of the World,’ they said, ‘One alone can change who made it. And were you so to voyage that escaping all deceits and snares you came indeed to Aman, the Blessed Realm, little would it profit you. For it is not the land of Manwë that makes its people deathless, but the Deathless that dwell therein have hallowed the land; and there you would but wither and grow weary the sooner, as moths in a light too strong and steadfast.’|''[[Akallabeth]]''}}\n\nThe Undying Lands were likely thus called like that because immortals dwelt in them, not because they granted immortality.\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn his later life, Tolkien pondered the fate of Aman after Eru's intervention. Since Aman was indeed a physical or \"real\" place, any true removal of it would have had to be physical as well. Therefore, unlike in previous versions of the legendarium where Aman was ambiguously rendered inaccessible to mortals but still a part of Arda, Tolkien decided that Aman would have been greatly changed by Eru during his catastrophic intervention. The landmass once known as Aman would eventually become the American continents: \"''Aman and Eressëa would be the memory of the Valar and Elves of the former land''\". He also changed his mind regarding what exactly the term \"Aman\" would refer to.<ref name=Nature>{{NM|P3xv}}</ref>\n\nThis would seem to suggest that said beings would enter into some form of incorporeal existence and no longer be physically present. This contradicts Tolkien's own earlier writings, such as Frodo going to Tol Eressëa in the flesh,<ref name=Nature/> or several of his letters, wherein Tolkien confirms that mortals would indeed die in Aman, which they could not do if they went to some form of non-corporeal existence.<ref>{{L|154}}</ref>\n==Inspiration==\nThe concept of the \"Paradise in the West\", a happy, deathless land outside time, is an old idea. In classical times some earthly afterlife was imagined with Elysium at the \"world's end\", and some Greek heroes who dwell serenely in \"the isles of the blessed\". Other later concepts came mainly from the northern Europe, although those Paradises were not associated with afterlife; they could occasionally be encountered by travelling mortals, like [[Faerie]], when the gods allowed it. [[Ireland]] had rich [[Celtic]] traditions of such travels, not only in the underground Otherworld, but also over the sea. During the Christian eras the ''imrama'' literature of fantastic ocean voyages, often by monks, flourished. One of them was the travel of [[Saint Brendan]], about which Tolkien composed [[Imram|a poem]], with elements of his Legendarium: [[Númenor]], [[Tol Eressea]], and the [[Straight Road]].<ref name=roche/>\n\nIn ''[[The Lost Road]]'' Tolkien made specific mention of those utopian myths. In the episode set in Anglo-Saxon times, [[Eädwine (son of Ælfwine)|Éadwine]] has heard strange tales from Ireland and wants to sail West like Brendan and Maelduin, hoping to find Paradise. The story of [[King Sheave]] also shows that there is such a place reachable by ship.<ref group=note>Regarding the Viking sea-burial as seen in the legend of [[King Sheave|King Sheaf]], Tolkien says that \"an actual belief in a magical land or otherworld located 'over the sea' can hardly be distinguished.\" Quoted in {{LR|P1III3}}, p. 95-96</ref> Other notes planned a story of Tir-nan-Og that wasn't written.<ref>{{LR|P1III3}}, p. 77-80</ref>\n\nAccording to Norma Roche, the concept of a western Paradise was recurring in Tolkien's legendarium and a vital part of it, including the regret for its loss. The pattern of [[Eriol]] and later [[Ælfwine]] belong to this example, as mortals who somehow reached the Blessed Realm, forming the frame story for the Legendarium.<ref name=roche>Roche, Norma (1991) \"[https://dc.swosu.edu/mythlore/vol17/iss4/3 Sailing West: Tolkien, the Saint Brendan Story, and the Idea of Paradise in the West]\", [[Mythlore]]: A Journal of J.R.R.
