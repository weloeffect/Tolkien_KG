He described the planet to the [[Notion Club]] as being \"''absolutely silent and quiescent''\" yet also being complete, a jewel, and imperishable in [[Time]]. He then pondered that \"''what adoring mind''\" made it could not be revealed. Ramer did not look at the sky of Minal-zidar due to the beauty of the planet being reflected by light back upon him, holding his gaze in place. [[Nicholas Guildford]] reported in the [[Notion Club Papers]] that [[Alwin Arundel Lowdham]] had claimed that after the meeting, Ramer had revealed to him that he had thought that Minal-zidar meant \"''Poise in Heaven''\".<ref>{{SD|2c}}, pp. 199-200, 218</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Cosmology]]\n[[Category:The Notion Club Papers]]"}}}
