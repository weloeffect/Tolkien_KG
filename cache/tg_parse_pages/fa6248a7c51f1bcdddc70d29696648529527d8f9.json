They were swart, slant-eyed, and had thick legs and large hands. An \"''S\"'' [[Cirth|elf-rune]] was wrought in white metal on the front of their iron helms. [[Aragorn]] guessed that this \"S\" stood for Saruman, as their shields were emblazoned with a small [[White Hand]] in the centre of a black field. This stood out in contrast to the Orcs in the service of [[Barad-dûr]], the folk of [[Mordor]], who used the symbol of the Red [[Eye of Sauron]]. Aragorn commented that the four dead Uruk-hai's gear \"''is not after the manner of Orcs at all.''\" Instead of curved scimitars that were usually used by Orcs, they had short, broad-bladed swords. Their [[bows]] were made of yew wood, in length and shape as those of Men.<ref>{{TT|Departure}}, pp. 415-16</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Origins of Uruks===\n{{Expansion}}\nThe race of Uruks, described as 'black orcs of great strength', first appeared out of [[Mordor]] in the last years of the [[Ruling Stewards|Stewardship]] of [[Denethor I]], possibly being secretly bred in Mordor by the [[Nazgûl|Morgul-lords]] at the behest of their master [[Sauron]].<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, pp. 204-5</ref> In {{TA|2475}}, these creatures conquered [[Ithilien]] and destroyed the ancient city of [[Osgiliath]], but they were eventually defeated and repelled by [[Boromir (Steward of Gondor)|Boromir]], the son of Denethor I.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}, entry for Steward Denethor I, p. 1053</ref>. After about five years (c. {{TA|2480}}) since their first appearance, Sauron started to populate [[Moria]] with his creatures and Orcs built secret strongholds in the [[Misty Mountains]] to block all the passes into [[Eriador]].<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year ''c.'' 2480, p. 1087</ref> In {{TA|2901}} most of the remaining inhabitants deserted Ithilien, because of attacks by Uruks of Mordor.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2901, p. 1088</ref>\n\nThe Uruks in the service of [[Barad-dûr]], the folk of Mordor, used the symbol of the [[Eye of Sauron|Red Eye of Sauron]] on their livery.<ref>{{RK|Tower}}, p. 903</ref><ref name=\"Shadow\">{{RK|Shadow}}, p. 924-5</ref>\n\n===War of the Ring===\nAround [[Third Age 2990|T.A. 2990]], the corrupted [[Wizard]] [[Saruman]] began to use and possibly breed Orcs in [[Isengard]]. As the [[Shadow]] of the [[Dark Lord|Enemy]] fell over [[Rohan]], Uruk-hai out of Isengard joined raiding parties of [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] against the [[Rohirrim]].<ref>{{App|Mark}}, ''Third Line'', p. 1070</ref>\n[[File:John_Howe_-_The_Charge_of_the_Rohirrim_at_Helm's_Deep.jpg|thumb|Uruk-hai face the Charge of the Rohirrim at Helm's Deep, Art by [[John Howe]]|367x367px]]\nThe Uruk-hai (Uruks) of Isengard made up the core of a ten-thousand strong army, mustered by the Wizard Saruman both in service to and in tacit competition with his Lord Sauron. On [[25 February]] [[Third Age 3019|T.A. 3019]], joined by [[Dunlendings]] and the common [[Orcs of Isengard]], they fought against the Rohirrim in the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen|First Battle of the fords of Isen]], in which Prince [[Théodred]] was slain by a great orc-man.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref> It is possible that this \"great orc-man\" was one of the Orcs who referred to themselves as the Uruk-hai,<ref>{{UT|Index}}, entry ''Orcs Passim''</ref> but it is also possible that he was a [[Half-orc]].\n\nOn [[26 February]] T.A. 3019, Saruman went behind Sauron's back and sent a smaller troop to capture the [[Ring-bearer]] for his own ends. Led by [[Uglúk]], these Uruk-hai ambushed the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] at [[Amon Hen]], slaying [[Boromir]] and capturing [[Merry]] and [[Pippin]].<ref name=\":2\">{{TT|Departure}}, p. 415</ref> Though quarreling with Orcs from the north and [[Grishnákh]]'s Mordor-orcs who had joined them, the Uruk-hai imposed Isengard as the destination for the captive [[Hobbits]]. Aragorn, [[Gimli]], and [[Legolas]] would follow the Uruk-hai troop and the other two Orc warbands until the Orcs and Uruk-hai were slain to the last on the eaves of [[Fangorn]] by [[Third Marshal of the Riddermark]] [[Éomer]] and his riders on [[27 February]] T.A. 3019.<ref>{{TT|Uruk}}, p. 459-60</ref>\n\nOn [[29 February]] T.A. 3019<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019, February 29, p. 1092</ref>, [[Treebeard]] was likely referring to the Uruk-hai when he said to [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] that Saruman had done something dangerous to the Orcs and that the Orcs of Saruman were more like wicked Men, because they could tolerate sunlight although they hated it. He openly wondered if they were Men that Saruman had \"ruined\" or if he had \"[[Half-orcs|blended]]\" Orcs and Men, an act which he considered to be \"a black evil.\"<ref>{{TT|Treebeard}}, p. 473</ref>\n\nThe Uruk-hai fought the Rohirrim again on [[2 March]] T.A. 3019 at [[Second Battle of the Fords of Isen]], where they defeated and scattered the Rohirrim who were under the command of [[Grimbold]]. The fortunes of the Uruk-hai would turn for the worst when their army was then sent against [[Kings of Rohan|King]] [[Théoden]] and his people at [[Helm's Deep]], where they faced utter defeat in the [[Battle of the Hornburg]] on [[3 March|3]]-[[4 March]] T.A. 3019.<ref>{{TT|Deep}}, pp. 531-42</ref>\n\nOn [[15 March]] T.A. 3019 [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] escaped [[Cirith Ungol]] and narrowly avoided two Orcs of Mordor who were searching for them. The Orcs speculated on exactly what it was they were searching for, with one of them saying that he had been told that it \"''must be a pack of rebel Uruk-hai''\".<ref name=\"Shadow\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Uruk-hai'' is a name in the [[Black Speech]], which means \"Orc-folk\".<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> It is a combination of the elements ''Uruk'' (\"orc\")<ref>{{PE|17}}, entry B '''uruk''', p. 47</ref> and ''hai'' (\"folk\")<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n''Uruks'' is the anglicized form of ''Uruk-hai''.<ref>{{UT|Index}}, entry ''Uruks''</ref> [[J.R.R.

He also used the phrase \"fighting Uruk-hai\" when he ordered a group of Orcs from the north to leave the two Hobbits with him when the northern Orcs wished to flee from the riders of the [[Rohirrim]]<ref>{{TT|Uruk}}, p. 451</ref>. He later referred to the Orcs under his command as \"the Uruk-hai of Isengard\" when he talked to Grishnákh after Grishnákh's group had returned<ref>{{TT|Uruk}}, p. 452</ref>. Later, during the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], the Orcs of Isengard gathered before the great gates of the Hornburg and referred to themselves twice as \"the fighting Uruk-hai\" and once simply as \"the Uruk-hai\" when Aragorn spoke to them from above the gates.<ref name=\"Deep\" />\n\nA large soldier Orc of Mordor bearing the token of the Eye told a small tracker Orc from Mordor that those \"Higher Up\" had eventually said that it must be \"a pack of rebel Uruk-hai\" whose scent they were following when they were tracking [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] after their escape from the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]].<ref name=\"Shadow\" />\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n1988: ''[[J.R.R.

They also use bladed shields as seen in [[Amon Hen]] during [[Aragorn]]'s fight against Lurtz. During the Battle of the Hornburg, all Uruk-hai (save for Berserkers) are equipped with heavy armor that covers everything other than their elbows and knees.
