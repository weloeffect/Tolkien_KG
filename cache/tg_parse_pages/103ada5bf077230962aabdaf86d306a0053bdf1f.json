It was replaced by the MERP 2nd Edition ''[[Moria (1994 book)|Moria]]''.\n\nFor use with this supplement, [[Mithril Miniatures]] released a set of metal miniatures (M155 - M164 ''Durin's Dwarves'').\n\n== Cover/Jacket Text == \n\nThis package details all of the DWARVEN CITY OF KHAZAD-DUM and includes 7 Deeps (levels and sublevels) maps and cross-section diagrams of both the city and the mines, diagrams of traps, machines and forging implements, large-scale detailed floorplans of specific areas: the Chamber of Marzarbul, the Endless Stair, Durin's Bridge, and the Entry Halls, information on Durin's tribe, three Orc tribes, the many creatures who later inhabit Moria, and, of course, the BALROG. \n\nDeep within the bowels of the central Misty Mountains lies Moria, the \"Black Chasm\". Here stood Khazad-Dum (Kh. \"Dwarf-mansion\") the kingdom of the noblest Lord of the Seven Tribes of Dwarves, a city sculpted from rock and embellished by the finest hall-builders of their day. Within its recesses Durin's folk mined precious metals and discovered mithril, the \"true-silver\". \n\nNow its chambers are dark and its builders gone. Tales speak of a Balrog, a \"Demon of Might\" which once served the Black Enemy Morgoth. \n\nBats and wolves and deadly traps await those daring few who seep the treasures buried deep in the still, dank chambers of the Black Chasm. \n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:MERP]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
