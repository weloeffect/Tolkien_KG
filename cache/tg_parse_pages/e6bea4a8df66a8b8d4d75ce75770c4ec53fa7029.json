Tolkien]]. Tolkien and Smith attended [[King Edward's School]] in [[Birmingham]] together. Smith would also become one of the core members of the [[T.C.B.S.]], but not until after [[Vincent Trought]]'s death. He was at that time already enrolled at Corpus Christi College, [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], close to Tolkien's Exeter College. The two became close friends there, because most other Edwardians went to Cambridge.\n\nSmith joined the 19th Service Battalion of the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire_Fusiliers Lancashire Fusilliers], the \"3rd Salford Pals\", and participated in the [[Battle of the Somme]].

Tolkien wrote the preface.\n\nIn the biographical drama film [[Tolkien (film)|Tolkien]], he was played by actor [[Anthony Boyle]]. \n\n==Quote==\n“My chief consolation is that if I am scuppered tonight there will still be left a member [of our School group] to voice what I dreamed and what we all agreed upon. For the death of one of its members cannot, I am determined, dissolve [the group]. Death can make us loathsome and helpless as individuals, but it cannot put an end to the immortal four!
