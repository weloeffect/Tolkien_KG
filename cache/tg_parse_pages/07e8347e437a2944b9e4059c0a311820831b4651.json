Unlike the previous three studio albums, the album name is not [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]-related. Only the song [[Rhûn (song)|Rhûn]] has a title directly referring to Tolkien. Despite many of the lyrics still being adapted from Tolkien's works, this album was the first to incorporate lyrics and audio samples from other works.<ref>{{Cite web|articleurl=https://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Summoning/Stronghold/114|articlename=Summoning - Stronghold Additional Notes|author=Metal Archives|accessed=26 July 2024|dated=4 June 2023}}</ref> \n\n==Lineup==\n\n*Protector: ''Vocals, Keyboards, Drum programming, Vocals (tracks 2, 4, 7-9)''\n*Silenius: ''Keyboards, Vocals (tracks 3, 6, 9)''\n\n==Track listing==\n#[[Rhûn (song)|Rhûn]] - ''3:25''\n#[[Long Lost to Where No Pathway Goes]] - ''7:23''\n#The Glory Disappears - ''7:49''\n#[[Like Some Snow-white Marble Eyes]] - ''7:19''\n#[[Where Hope and Daylight Die]] - ''6:28''\n#[[The Rotting Horse on the Deadly Ground]] - ''8:25''\n#[[The Shadow Lies Frozen on the Hills]] - ''7:01''\n#The Loud Music of the Sky - ''6:47''\n#[[A Distant Flame Before the Sun]] - ''9:43''\n{{References}}{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Albums]]"}}}
