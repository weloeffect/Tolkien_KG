This scene was not featured in the theatrical release of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''.\n\n==Synopsis==\nFrodo, [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] and [[Gollum]] climb the stairs of [[Cirith Ungol]]. Gollum describes their path as up the stairs and then into the [[Shelob's Lair|tunnel]]. Sam asks what is in the tunnel which Gollum does not answer. Sam grabs Gollum and threatens him saying \"Anything happens to him, you have me to answer to. One sniff that something's not right, one hair that stands up on the back of my head, it's over.\" Sam catches up to Frodo asks what that was about and Sam states he was just clearing something up. Gollum smiles seemingly at the fate the hobbits don't yet realize is awaiting them at the top of the stairs.\n\n==Differences==\n\n*In the books Sam, Frodo and Gollum have reached Shelob's Lair by the end of [[The Two Towers]].<ref name=\":0\">{{TT|IV9}}</ref>\n*In the books Sam questions Gollum several times about the tunnel but seems to accept he won't get an answer and does not give him a warning as he does in this scene.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King scenes|16]]\n\n{{references}}"}}}
