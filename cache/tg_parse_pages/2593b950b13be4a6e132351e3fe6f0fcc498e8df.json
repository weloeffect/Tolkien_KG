Tolkien]] in which he translated \"[[Wikipedia:Lewis Carroll|Lewis Carroll]]'s famous nonsense poem [[Wikipedia:Jabberwocky|Jabberwocky]]\"<ref name=interview/> into [[Old English]], making \"up words to represent Carroll’s made-up words\"<ref name=interview/> on a single manuscript.<ref name=collectedpoems>{{CP|A5}}</ref>\n\n== First stanza ==\n=== Old English ===\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\n:Þa wæs swelswoloð.

Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] think about Tolkien's [[The Tale of Beewolf Son of Echgethew|verse translation]]<ref>{{CP|88}}</ref> of ''[[Beowulf]]''.<ref name=collectedpoems/>\n\n''Bealuwearge'', or ''Bealuwearg'',<ref name=collectedpoems/> is a name meaning \"malicious outlaw\" in Old English, recalling \"Tolkien's fell creature…, the ''[[Durin's Bane|Balrog]]'',…and the wolf-like beasts…called ''[[Wargs]]''\".<ref name=interview/> In a list of [[Elvish]] names translated into Old English, ''Balrog'' is translated by Tolkien as ''Bealuwearg'' and ''Bealubróga''. The etymology of these words were noted by [[Christopher Tolkien]]<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Christina Scull]] and [[Wayne G.

Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] theorized based on the handwriting that it was possibly written in the 1930s. After the poem was finished, Tolkien gave it to [[C.S. Lewis]] sometime before his death in [[1963]], after which, it came into the possession of [[Walter Hooper]].<ref name=collectedpoems/>\n\nIn [[2023]], the [[Bodleian Library]] acquired the manuscript from Walter Hooper's estate by way of the Arts Council. Sometime while finalizing the general parts of a collection of Tolkien's poems, ''Bealuwérig'' came to the attention of Hammond and Scull. In their analysis of ''Bealuwérig'', they initially did not realize that it was a translation of Jabberwocky, \"looking up words in Old English dictionaries, but could not find them\".<ref name=interview/> Eventually, they did find out that the poem was a translation.<ref name=interview/> Though there was no way to include it with the other poems, they found it to be \"too interesting not to present by itself as\" Appendix V. [[Arden R. Smith]] assisted them with translating the poem.<ref name=collectedpoems/>\n\nIn [[2024]], the translation was published in September as part of ''[[The Collected Poems of J.R.R.
