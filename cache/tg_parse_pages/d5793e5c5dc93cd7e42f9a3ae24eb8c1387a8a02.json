The [[Vanyar]] and the [[Noldor]] went first to [[Valinor]], riding aboard an island pulled by [[Ulmo]]. There they would begin to integrate with the [[Valar]] and settle across the continent. Part of the island broke off, however, and became known as the isle of [[Balar]].\n\nHowever, not all of the Eldar went to Valinor, for the [[Teleri]] tarried on the shores of [[Beleriand]] in search of their [[Thingol|missing lord]]. Those who remained built the cities of [[Brithombar]] and [[Eglarest]] on the shores of [[Falas]], with [[Círdan]] as their leader. Yet afterwards, partly at the behest of the Noldor, Ulmo went back to Middle-earth to collect the Teleri.\n\nThe island was dragged back across the sea to Middle-earth. Many Teleri embarked, but they did not wish to wholly lose access to Middle-earth. Ulmo listened to their request, stopping the island before the journey was finished. The island came to rest upon the shores of [[Aman]] and would be known as [[Tol Eressëa]], the lonely isle, for it was still separated from the Undying Lands by the sea. This physical separation from the other elves gradually began a process whereby their languages were sundered.\n\nThe Noldor and Vanyar initially lived within a gap of the [[Pelori]] Mountains on the border of Aman. There they made a city known as [[Tirion]], with many white walls and towers, and even a scion of one of the Two Trees, known as [[Galathilion]]. The Vanyar became the elves most loved by [[Manwë]] and [[Varda]], while [[Aulë]] loved the Noldor most of all, teaching them much of his smithing and crafts. The Noldor became highly skilled and generous with their work.\n\nIt was during these years that the royal family of the Noldor came into existence. The Noldor were ruled by a high king named [[Finwë]], who had three sons: [[Fëanor]], [[Fingolfin]], and [[Finarfin]]. Yet they were not of the same mother, for [[Míriel]], Finwë's first wife, died in childbirth. Fingolfin and Finarfin were the result of his second marriage to the Vanya [[Indis]].\n\nFinwë's sons would have their own progenies: the seven [[Sons of Fëanor]]; [[Fingon]], [[Turgon]], and [[Aredhel]] to Fingolfin; [[Finrod]], [[Galadriel]], [[Angrod]], [[Aegnor]], and [[Orodreth]]<ref>{{S|14}} Orodreth is referred to as Finarfin's son in current editions of ''The Silmarillion'', though his relationship changed in more recent versions of Tolkien's writing. Unless it is edited in a future edition, please do not change this.</ref> was in [[Tol Sirion]] between Dorthonion and the [[Shadowy Mountains]]. to Finarfin. Each of these would in their time be important in their own right, but their times had not yet come.\n\nThe Teleri, at last wishing to see the light of Valinor and of their friends among the other elves, desired to leave Tol Eressëa and go to Aman. Ulmo sent them [[Ossë]] to teach the art of shipbuilding. The Teleri built their ships and sailed to the coasts of Aman, where they eventually built the port of [[Alqualondë]] and became renowned for their swan shaped boats. Gradually, they would become close the Noldor of Tirion.\n\nEven though both Noldor and Vanyar had come the whole way to Aman, they would gradually begin to shift apart. The Vanyar sought to learn more of Aman and the Valar, while the Noldor still remembered Middle-earth and sought to increase their knowledge of the world. As the years went on, [[Fëanor]] and his son became students of [[Aulë]] where they learned much of the skills of smithing and craftwork. Thus would begin the rise of the most prominent elf of all.\n==House of Finwë==\n<br>{{familytree/start}}{{familytree | MÍR |y| FIN |y| IND | | | | | | | | |FIN='''FINWË'''<br /><small>''d. {{YT|1495}}''</small>|IND=[[Indis]]<br/><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|MÍR=[[Míriel]]<br /><small>''d. {{YT|1170}}''</small>}}{{familytree | | | |!| | | |)|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| |}}{{familytree | | | FËA | | FND | | FNG | | IRI | | FNR |FËA=[[Fëanor]]<br /><small>''{{YT|1169}} - {{YT|1497|n}}''</small>|FND=[[Findis]]<br/><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|FNG=[[Fingolfin]]<br /><small>''{{YT|1190}} - {{FA|456}}''</small>|IRI=[[Írimë]]<br/><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|FNR=[[Finarfin]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT|1230}}''</small>}}{{familytree | | | |:| | | | | | | |:| | | | | | | |:| |}}{{familytree | | |HFE| | | | | |HFG| | | | | |HFN| |HFE=<small>''[[House of Fëanor]]''</small>|HFG=<small>''[[House of Fingolfin]]''</small>|HFN=<small>''[[House of Finarfin]]''</small>}}{{familytree/end}}<br>\n{{references}}\n==External links==\n* [https://entmoot.tolkientrail.com/showthread.php?t=7904 Chapter discussion at Entmoot.com]\n* [https://forum.barrowdowns.com/showthread.php?t=13473 Chapter discussion at BarrowDowns.com]\n\n[[fr:tolkien/resumes/silm/qs5]]\n[[fi:Eldamar ja eldaliën ruhtinaat (Silmarillion)]]"}}}
