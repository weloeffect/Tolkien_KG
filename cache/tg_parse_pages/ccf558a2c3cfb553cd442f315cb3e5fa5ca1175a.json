The songs \"Might And Glory\" and \"Land Of The Dead\" both feature a self-sung choir chorus similar to what was used on the ''[[Let Mortal Heroes Sing Your Fame]]'' song \"Farewell\". To date it is Summoning's longest release, just 21 seconds longer than ''[[Dol Guldur (album)|Dol Guldur]]''. The name Oath Bound was selected as it fits well with ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' theme the album has, in reference to the [[Oath of Fëanor]].\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist\n| collapsed       = \n| headline        = \n| extra_column    = \n| total_length    = \n\n| all_writing     = \n| all_lyrics      = \n| all_music       = \n\n| writing_credits = \n| lyrics_credits  = \n| music_credits   = \n\n| title1          = [[Bauglir (song)|Bauglir]]\n| note1           = \n| writer1         = \n| lyrics1         = \n| music1          = \n| extra1          = \n| length1         = 02:58\n\n| title2          = [[Across the Streaming Tide]]\n| note2           = \n| writer2         = \n| lyrics2         = \n| music2          = \n| extra2          = \n| length2         = 10:20\n\n| title3         = [[Mirdautas Vras]]\n| note3          = \n| writer3        = \n| lyrics3        = \n| music3         = \n| extra3         = \n| length3        = 08:13\n\n| title4         = [[Might and Glory]]\n| note4          = \n| writer4        = \n| lyrics4        = \n| music4         = \n| extra4         = \n| length4        = 08:26\n\n| title5         = [[Beleriand (song)|Beleriand]]\n| note5          = \n| writer5        = \n| lyrics5        = \n| music5         = \n| extra5         = \n| length5        = 09:27\n\n| title6         = [[Northward]]\n| note6          = \n| writer6        = \n| lyrics6        = \n| music6         = \n| extra6         = \n| length6        = 08:39\n\n| title7         = [[Menegroth (song)|Menegroth]]\n| note7          = \n| writer7        = \n| lyrics7        = \n| music7         = \n| extra7         = \n| length7        = 08:12\n\n| title8         = [[Land of the Dead]]\n| note8          = \n| writer8        = \n| lyrics8        = \n| music8         = \n| extra8         = \n| length8        = 12:50\n}}\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Albums]]"}}}
