Tolkien]]'s original manuscripts (more than 11,000 pieces). [https://www.marquette.edu/library/archives/tolkien.php William Fliss] is the Marquette University Archivist who maintains the collection. [[Matt Blessing]] was previously in charge of maintaining the collection (1999-2012).\n\n==History of the collection==\nIn late December [[1956]] or early January [[1957]] [[William Ready]], the Director of Libraries at Marquette University, was compiling the University's research-related collections and he asked Bertram Rota, a well-known London bookseller if she could approach J.R.R. Tolkien to see if he was willing to sell the original manuscripts of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Rota wrote to Tolkien and prior to [[10 January|January 10]]th Tolkien replied. \n\nOn [[10 January|January 10]]th, Bertram Rota responded to William Ready at Marquette. Tolkien was willing to consider selling his manuscripts but asked what amount the University was willing to offer. He sent a list of ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'' material he considered selling. Rota suggested to Ready a minimum offer of £1,000, however she would have liked to examine the documents personally before the final decision was made. At last the price was set to £1500.\n\n===The manuscripts===\nThis arrangement was finalized in May of [[1957]], and a significant amount of material was transferred across the Atlantic that June, with ''The Lord of the Rings'' material being sent mostly in [[1958]] and later additional material being sent by [[Christopher Tolkien]] when discovered in his father’s papers.<ref>[https://www.tolkienguide.com/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?post_id=21554 Historical context of the 2018 Bodleian Exhibition] (accessed 11 June 2022)</ref>\n*More that 1,500 pages (manuscript, typescript, and corrected proofs) for ''The Hobbit'', including preliminary dustjacket designs.\n*More than 200 pages (manuscript, typescript, and corrected proofs) for ''Farmer Giles of Ham'', but not including notes for the foreword and unfinished sequel.\n*The complete illustrated manuscript for ''Mr. Bliss'', at more than 60 pages.\n*More than 9,200 pages of material for ''The Lord of the Rings'' including the unfinished ''Epilogue'', but not including almost all of Tolkien’s artwork.\n\n==Tolkien exhibitions==\nThe Marquette University has held a number of [[Tolkien exhibitions|exhibitions focused on Tolkien]].\n\n*[[1983]] — \"The Road Goes Ever On\" (conference) and \"The Manuscripts of J.R.R.T.\" (exhibition)\n**Exhibition catalogue — ''[[The Manuscripts of J.R.R.T.]]''\n\n*[[1987]] — \"J.R.R.Tolkien: The Hobbit Drawings, Watercolors, and Manuscripts\" (exhibition)\n**Exhibition catalogue — ''[[J.R.R.
