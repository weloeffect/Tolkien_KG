The organization fell into disarray and its leadership fled after the overthrow of Morgoth in the [[War of Wrath]]. In the meantime, [[Men]] had arrived in the region. Around {{SA|100}}, [[Koronandë]] and later [[Hathor]] were founded. In {{SA|1300}}, the Númenórean colony [[Tantûrak]] was founded.<ref name=\"history\">{{ICE|2500}}, pp. 11-12</ref>\n\nThe Magician from the Court of Ardor arrived in Tantûrak around {{SA|2000}}, and inadvertently led to the ouster of [[Fourth of the Nazgûl|Jí Indûr]], who had been the contested king of the erstwhile republic Koronandë. Having fled to the tribes of Mûmakan, with the aid of [[Sauron]]'s influence, he presented himself as the second-coming of their God-king Amaav a year later. As Jí Amaav II, Indûr united the tribes, and subjugated Gan and parts of Dûshera (near the Swamp of Geshaan). Further expansion was contested by Númenor and the Court of Ardor. Ultimately, he made a pact with the Magician.  With Indûr's support, Tantûrak cut ties with Númenor in {{SA|3000}}. Koronandë was thus surrounded by hostile forces, solely spared from complete conquest because of the rivalry between Indûr's Mûmakan Empire and Tantûrak. [[Ar-Pharazon]] defeated Indûr and reconquered Tantûrak in {{SA|3262}}.<ref name=\"nazgul\">{{ICE|8003}}, pp. 90-91</ref>\n\nWhen Indûr returned in {{TA|1050}}, he slowly worked on rebuilding his empire. By {{TA|1250}} he had united the tribes into a loose military coalition focused on expansion. Again under the Magician's sway, Tantûrak declared war on Koronandë in {{TA|1365}}. Through Indûr's intervention, a peace was reached in {{TA|1372}}, which increased his influence.<ref name=\"nazgul\"/> \n\nThe relative peace of the continent was broken by {{TA|1650}}, with more and more minor battles having broken out as the population increased. Orcs and wargs became increasingly common sights, and they often raided Dûshera's villages.<ref name=\"history\">{{ICE|2500}}, pp. 11-12</ref>\n\nBy {{TA|3000}}, the replacement of the deceased Magician by an agent of Sauron had led to Tantûrak coming under his sway. Tantûrak regularly raided Hathor during this time, and dominated Dûshera.<ref>{{ICE|2500}}, p. 52</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n===Coasts===\nThe majority of the Mûmakan coastline consisted of sandy beaches, with the notable exception of the southern tip of the peninsula. That region was rocky, rising to sheer cliffs up to 300 feet high which were honeycombed with caves and grottoes. While the inland regions near the coast generally consisted of wild grass and scattered pines or palms, the jungle foliage occasionally extended almost to the water's edge.\n\nThe coastal waters were rich in marine life. Sharks were rare within ten miles of the shore, allowing the inhabitants of Hathor and Koronandë to harvest plentiful fish stocks safely.<ref name=\"florafauna\">{{ICE|2500}}, pp. 12-13</ref>\n\n===Rainforest===\nRainforests covered much of the land, with a dense canopy of trees that grew 100 to 150 feet in height and blocked most sunlight. This lack of sunlight meant that travellers who managed to breach the initial thickets would then encounter a spacious inner area. ''Lurakil'', or lord trees, rose above the canopy, growing over 200 feet. This is where Elves and Kirani built tree-houses.\n\nThe rainforest fauna included brightly plumaged birds, gliding squirrels, and large constrictor snakes. Predators such as leopards and ocelots were also present but rarely ventured near human settlements.<ref name=\"florafauna\"/>\n\n===Plains and hills===\nThe plains of the Mûmakan were barren compared to the jungle, consisting of endless grass broken only by stunted trees and wild grains. These lands supported herds of gazelles, wild horses, and the region's most famous inhabitants, the [[Mûmakil]].\n\nThe hilly regions, particularly the spines running down the peninsulas, offered a cooler climate and abundant water. Agriculture was possible here: fields of corn and cotton in the south, while wheat was grown in Dûshera, which was a region of independent hill-towns.<ref name=\"florafauna\"/><ref>{{ICE|2500}}, p. 15</ref>\n\n===Swamp of Geshaan===\nThe swamp of Geshaan resembled the rainforest, but it was untamed and treacherous. The unstable ground is often submerged under several feet of stagnant water, and otherwise is filled with fallen trees, huge vines, and overgrown underbrush that make passage nearly impossible.<ref name=\"florafauna\"/>\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Middle-earth Role Playing locations]]"}}}
