It seems to be a long poem, telling the story of the [[War of the Last Alliance]], at least to the point where [[Gil-galad]] aided in the overthrow of [[Sauron]], and was himself slain. \n\n[[Bilbo Baggins]] later translated it into the [[Westron|Common Tongue]], and taught it to [[Samwise Gamgee]] in his youth, who mistakenly thought that Bilbo was the composer. \n\nSam narrated the three introductory stanzas while approaching [[Weathertop]], but he did not recall the following verses, which were \"all about [[Mordor]]\". Aragorn and Frodo knew more of the text.<ref name=\"FKnife\">{{FR|Knife}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''\n: Sam sang the song during his trip to Rivendell.\n\n==External links==\n\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUPFwrmgLvQ Fall of Gil-Galad] sung by [[Clamavi De Profundis]] \n\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xpyuTRmyKM Fall of Gil-Galad] sung by Anois\n{{references}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fall of Gil-galad}}\n[[Category:Poems in The Fellowship of the Ring]]\n[[Category:Songs]]\n\n[[de:Gil-galad#Sonstiges]]\n[[fi:Gil-galadin tuho]]"}}}
