Tolkien]] and edited by his son, [[Christopher Tolkien]]. Published on [[30 August]] [[2018]], it contains the various versions of the story previously published throughout the volumes of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', along with commentary from Christopher.\n\nThe story tells of the ancient hidden city of [[Gondolin]], a [[Noldor]]in stronghold in defiance of [[Morgoth]]; the coming of the man [[Tuor]] at the bidding of the god [[Ulmo]]. The city is betrayed, and is attacked and conquered by Morgoth's army. And from [[Eärendil]], Tuor's son, comes the hope for the future.\n\nThe story is one of three \"great tales\" set in the [[First Age]] of Tolkien's [[Middle-earth]], the other two being ''[[The Children of Húrin]]'' and ''[[Beren and Lúthien]]''. It is the last book edited by Christopher Tolkien before his death, in [[2020]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn the ''Tale of The Fall of Gondolin'' are two of the greatest powers: [[Morgoth]] of the uttermost evil; and opposed to him is [[Ulmo]], who is called the Lord of Waters. Central to this enmity of the gods is the city of Gondolin, beautiful but undiscoverable. It was built and peopled by exiled Noldorin Elves. Morgoth seeks in vain to discover the marvelously hidden city, while the Valar largely refuse to intervene in support of Ulmo, who desires to protect it.\n\nInto this world comes [[Tuor]], cousin of [[Túrin]], the instrument of Ulmo's designs. Guided unseen by him Tuor sets out from the land of his birth on the fearful journey to Gondolin, and in one of the most arresting moments in the history of Middle-earth the Vala himself appears to him, rising out of the ocean in the midst of a storm. In Gondolin he becomes great; he is wedded to [[Idril]], [[Turgon]]'s daughter, and their son is [[Eärendel]], whose birth and profound importance in days to come is foreseen by Ulmo.\n\nAt last comes the terrible ending. Morgoth learns through an act of supreme treachery all that he needs to mount a devastating attack on the city, with Balrogs and dragons and numberless Orcs. After a minutely observed account of the fall of Gondolin, the tale ends with the escape of Tuor and Idril, with the child Eärendel, looking back from a cleft in the mountains as they flee southward, at the blazing wreckage of their city. They were journeying into a new story, the Tale of Eärendel, which Tolkien never wrote, but which is sketched out in this book from other sources.\n\n==Contents==\n* Preface\n* Prologue\n\n* '''The Fall of Gondolin'''\n:{|\n|◦ ''[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Original Tale]] || [''[[The Book of Lost Tales: Part Two|LT II]]'', [[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|ch. 3]]]\n|-\n|◦ The Earliest Text || [''[[The Book of Lost Tales: Part Two|LT II]]'', [[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|ch. 3]], [[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)#Commentary|comm.]], §3, (vi)]\n|-\n|◦ [[Prose Fragments Following the Lost Tales#First fragment|Turlin and the Exiles of Gondolin]] || [''[[The Shaping of Middle-earth|Shaping]]'', [[Prose Fragments Following the Lost Tales|ch. 1]], (i)]\n|-\n|◦ The Story Told in the ''[[The Earliest 'Silmarillion'|Sketch of the Mythology]]'' || [''[[The Shaping of Middle-earth|Shaping]]'', [[The Earliest 'Silmarillion'|ch. 2]],  §§15-16]\n|-\n|◦ The Story Told in the ''[[The Quenta#Quenta Noldorinwa|Quenta Noldorinwa]]'' || [''[[The Shaping of Middle-earth|Shaping]]'', [[The Quenta#Quenta Noldorinwa|ch. 3]], §§15-17]\n|-\n|◦ [[Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin|The Last Version]] || [''[[Unfinished Tales|UT]]'', pt. 1, [[Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin|ch. 1]]]\n|-\n|◦ The Evolution of the Story\n|-\n|◦ Conclusion || [''[[The Shaping of Middle-earth|Shaping]]'', [[The Earliest 'Silmarillion'|ch. 2]],  §§17-19] || [''[[The Shaping of Middle-earth|Shaping]]'', [[The Quenta#Quenta Noldorinwa|ch. 3]], §§17-19]\n|}\n* List of Names\n* Additional Notes\n* Glossary\n\n==Conception and development==\nTolkien said that the story was written \"out of [his] head\" during sick-leave from the army in [[1917]]<ref>{{L|257}}</ref> and it was the very first tale of his later [[legendarium]] that he ever composed. The earliest saved manuscript was written in an exercise book (that was subsequently clean-copied by his wife [[Edith Bratt|Edith]]) and was one of the stories of the [[Lost Tales]]; this manuscript was the last time Tolkien wrote the complete tale of Tuor with a detailed description of the city. He also read part of the story to the Essay Club of Exeter College in the spring of [[1920]].<ref name=utintro>{{UT|Introduction}}</ref><ref>{{LT2|III}}</ref> \n\nLater Tolkien attempted to make a verse version of it, as [[The Lay of the Fall of Gondolin]], in the early 1920s whilst at the [[University of Leeds]].<ref>{{LB|Fall}}, p. 145</ref> In the late 1920s he wrote a compressed version to be a part of his intended ''Silmarillion''<ref name=utintro/> such as in ''[[The Quenta]]'', which was the last complete chronicle of the [[Battles of Beleriand|War of the Jewels]] that Tolkien ever wrote;<ref>{{SM|Quenta}}</ref> both the later works ''[[The Later Quenta Silmarillion]]'' and the ''[[Grey Annals]]'' stop before the time of Tuor.\n\nTolkien regarded the story as one of the [[Atanatarion|three \"Great Tales\"]] of the Elder Days and wished to expand it as an independent full-scale story.<ref>{{BL|Preface}}</ref> In this form, he started writing ''Of Tuor and the Fall of Gondolin'', probably in [[1951]], but it was abandoned.<ref name=utintro/> \n\nThe whole story was first published in [[1977]] in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' which used as a main source the Lost Tale of 1917. The expanded, partially-reworked, 1951 version appeared in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' in [[1980]] retitled as \"[[Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin]]\" (as the text doesn't continue beyond that). The earliest version of the story was published in [[1984]] as [[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|one]] of the chapters in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]''.\n\n==Reception==\nOn hearing the news, [[The Tolkien Society]] claimed the book has been anticipated by fans for decades,<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://twitter.com/TolkienSociety/status/983616157876932608|website=[http://www.twitter.com Twitter]|dated=10 April 2018|accessed=10 April 2018}}</ref> whilst its chair [[Shaun Gunner]] said \"''The Fall of Gondolin is, to many in the Tolkien community, the Holy Grail of Tolkien texts as one of Tolkien’s three Great Tales alongside ''The Children of Húrin'' and ''Beren and Lúthien''.''\"<ref>{{webcite|website=TS|articleurl=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/2018/04/the-fall-of-gondolin-to-be-published/|articlename=The Fall of Gondolin to be published|dated=10 April 2018|accessed=10 April 2018}}</ref> [[John Garth]], author of ''[[Tolkien and the Great War]]'', described the book as \"''a template for everything Tolkien wrote afterwards''\" which is the \"''biggest battle narrative outside of ''The Lord of the Rings''.\"<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/10/the-fall-of-gondolin-new-jrr-tolkien-book-to-be-published-in-2018|articlename=The Fall of Gondolin, 'new' JRR Tolkien book, to be published in 2018|dated=10 April 2018|accessed=10 April 2018|author=Alison Flood|website=[http://www.theguardian.com The Guardian]}}</ref>\n\n==Publication history and gallery==\n;UK editions\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"125px\" heights=\"125px\">\nFile:Fall of Gondolin 2018.jpeg ‎|2018 hardcover\nFile:Fall of Gondolin 2018 deluxe.png |2018 hardcover deluxe edition\nFile:Fall of Gondolin 2018 large.png |2018 paperback large print\nFile:Fall of Gondolin 2020.jpeg |2020 paperback \nFile:Fall of Gondolin 2022.jpeg |2022 paperback\nFile:Fall of Gondolin 2023.jpg |2023 paperback\nFile:Fall of Gondolin 2018.jpeg ‎|2025 hardcover (boxed set)\n</gallery>\n*[[HarperCollins]] hardcover ([[2018]]), pp. 304.
