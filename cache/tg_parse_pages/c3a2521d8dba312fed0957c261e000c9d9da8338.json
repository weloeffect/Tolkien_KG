Unlike most other volumes, it is not a collection of essays, but a the work by [[Ross Smith]]. \n\n== From the publisher ==\n{{blockquote|Tolkien's views on language, though never published as a formalised theory, were in some aspects rather \"heretic\" (to use [[Tom Shippey]]'s term) and seemed to fly into the face of \"established\" linguistic theory — most notably his conception of \"native (hereditary) language\" and, related to it, the idea of \"linguistic aesthetic\" and \"phonetic fitness\". Unfortunately, this aspect of Tolkien's linguistic work has, as yet, not received the attention it deserves. This is remedied by Ross Smith's study that investigates the question of Tolkien's position on language vis-a-vis the then (and even now) dominant tenet(s) in some depth.}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.walking-tree.org/cormareBookInfo.php?number=12 Official product page]\n{{Cormarë}}\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Linguistic books]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
