He thereafter had neither joy nor quiet in his heart and a dread possessed him that Melko was ever at hand. He was, however, still able to feign gaiety, even to the point that his people (save [[Idril]]) thought better of him than before.<ref name=lt2_3 />\n\n== Similar concepts in later works ==\nThis concept continued throughout the later versions of the legendarium.\n\nFollowing his loss in the [[Dagor Aglareb]], Morgoth changed his tactics and bid his Orcs to take alive any Eldar they could and bring them to Angband. Of them, it is stated that \"some indeed he so daunted by the terror of his eyes that they needed no chains more, but walked ever in fear of him, doing his will wherever they might be. These he would unbind and let return to work treason among their own kin.\"<ref>{{GA|81}}</ref> This appears to have been less effective against the [[Noldor]], however, as they were \"a mighty race yet, and few of them could he so daunt that they would do his will, but escaping they became oft his deadliest foes\".<ref>{{GA|82}}</ref> \n\nPrior to the battle of [[Unnumbered Tears]], emissaries of Morgoth went among the Elven camps, and they were thrall-Gnomes or things in Elvish form. They spread foreboding of evil and the suspicion of treason among all who would listen to them.<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}</ref>{{rp|§9}}\n\nIn ''[[Myths Transformed]]'', the [[Battle of the Powers]] ends with the [[Valar]] confronting Melkor directly after dealing with his agents piecemeal. To Melkor's amazement, he realises he has disbursed so much of his personal force that he can no longer daunt [[Manwë]] with his gaze.<ref>{{MR|P5VII}}</ref>\n\nA similar association is with [[Eöl]]. On his encounter with Isfin ([[Aredhel]]) she \"came into the enchantments of Ëol the Dark-elf\" who took her to wife and \"suffered her not to stray far, nor to fare abroad save in the dark or the twilight\".<ref>{{GA|118}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Magic]]"}}}
