God bless you in all your days on earth – now so unhappy, though I think it has often (or usually) been quite as unhappy, if perhaps never in such great peril. Your mother has perhaps told you that my eldest son, [[John Tolkien|Fr John]], said a (Latin) mass for your dear father, and I served it. Spare me a prayer of your sweet charity: I have need.<br/><br/>Yours very sincerely<br/><br/>JRR Tolkien}}\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Letters|MacNamara, Rose]]"}}}
