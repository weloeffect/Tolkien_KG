One evening in {{TA|2941}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>, Galion and the chief of the guards decided to taste some new wine that had recently arrived to \"''see if it is fit for the king's table''\". The heady vintage from [[Dorwinion]] soon caused the two Elves to fall asleep, which gave [[Bilbo Baggins]] his chance to free [[Thorin]] and [[Thorin and Company|the other Dwarves]], all of whom had been imprisoned in Thranduil's dungeons during the [[Quest of Erebor]]. Using the chief guard's keys and his [[One Ring|Magic Ring]], Bilbo freed the [[Dwarves]] and secreted them into several empty barrels. When other Elves arrived to push the barrels into the [[Forest River]] - which flowed through the [[Elvenking's Halls]] and eventually led to the [[Long Lake]] - they found Galion and woke him. Noticing the heaviness of some \"empty\" barrels, Galion growled at the workers and ordered them to push the barrels into the water.<ref name=barrels/>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Galion'' is said to be ''not'' [[Sindarin]], although perhaps \"'Sindarized' in shape\".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 54</ref><ref group=note>For a name given the same description, cf.

Instead, he is one of two elves whom Bilbo observes getting drunk.\n\n'''1980: [[Der Hobbit (1980 German radio series)|''Der Hobbit'' (1980 German radio series)]]:'''\n:Galion is played by Heinz Theo Branding.\n\n'''1982: [[The Hobbit (1982 video game)|''The Hobbit'' (1982 video game)]]:'''\n: The game features an NPC simply known as \"Butler\" that appears in the Elvenking's halls, where he empties wine barrels to send back down the river, but he will throw the party members in the dungeons if he spots them. It is also possible for him to be killed, either by the player or one of their companions.\n\n'''2003: [[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|''The Hobbit'' (2003 video game)]]:'''\n:This video game depicts only Galion, and not the Captain of the Guard. The butler does not succumb to drunkenness, but because Bilbo puts three herbs - Moonleaf, Willowweed and Spider's Bane - in his mug. This change was possibly made to ensure a more favourable [[wikipedia:Video game content rating system|game rating]].\n\n'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]:'''''\n:Galion is portrayed by Craig Hall. He is briefly seen by [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] (while he's wearing [[the One Ring]]) in the cellars of the [[Elvenking's Halls]] praising the selections of wine. He invites [[Chief of the guards|Elros]] to drink with him, and they both end up passing out, allowing Bilbo and the [[Thorin and Company|Dwarves]] to escape through the cellars.\n\n'''2017: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Galion can be found in King [[Thranduil|Thranduil's]] [[Elvenking's Halls|halls of Felegoth]].\n\n{{references|note}}\n\n[[Category:Characters in The Hobbit]]\n[[Category:Elvish words]]\n[[Category:Silvan Elves]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n\n[[de:Galion]]\n[[fi:Galion]]"}}}
