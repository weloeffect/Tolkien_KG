Tolkien]], the music by [[Donald Swann]].\n\nThe first edition was published in [[1967]], containing six poems from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and one from ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]''. Within the book are included Tolkien's own notes and translations on two Elvish text: \"[[Namárië]]\" and \"[[A Elbereth Gilthoniel]]\", thus it is also an important document of the glossary and lore of [[Elvish]].\n\nThe second edition was released in [[1978]], adding the \"[[Bilbo's Last Song]]\"; in the foreword Swann recounts his collaborations with J.R.R. Tolkien; and the third edition in [[2002]], adding the poem \"[[Song of Parting|Lúthien Tinúviel]]\" from ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.\n\nThe third edition, after having been long out of print, was finally reprinted in September 2023 and is available again.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:The Road Goes Ever On tailpiece.jpg|thumb|center|400px|A decorative tailpiece in the book]]\nThis book has been valued even by those uninterested in music, since it helps Tolkien's readers to better understand the cultures of the various mythological beings presented in [[Middle-earth]], and helps linguists analyse Tolkien's poetry. As well as the poems, notes, and translations, Tolkien contributed decorations in the form of [[Elvish]] script for the top and bottom of every page of sheet music, and tailpieces for the spaces at the ends of the poems.\n\nThe book contains one of the longest samples of the language [[Quenya]], in the shape of the song \"''[[Namárië]]''\" (which appears on the cover in [[Tengwar]]), as well as the Sindarin prayer \"''[[A Elbereth Gilthoniel]]''\" with grammatical explanations. Tolkien's notes in the book provide information about the [[First Age]] of Middle-earth that was not otherwise publicly available until the publication of ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.<ref>{{HM|A}}Robert Foster, ''[[A Guide to Middle-earth]]''</ref>\n\n==Contents==\n* Introduction\n* ''Foreword by Donald Swann''\n* ''Foreword to the Third edition''\n\n* 1.
