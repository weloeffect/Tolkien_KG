Tolkien]], probably dating from the early 1930s. Apparently, the poem was at some point intended by Tolkien to be included in the chapter \"A Short Rest\" from ''The Hobbit'', following the passage: \"The [the elves] went into another song as ridiculous as the one I have written down in full.\" It exists in two versions, one untitled and titled. The latter (supposedly the latest) was published for the first time by [[Douglas A. Anderson]] in ''[[The Annotated Hobbit]]: Revised and Expanded Edition'' (2002).\n\n==Excerpt (first stanza)==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nCome home, come home, ye merry folk!\nThe sun is sinking, and the oak\n   In gloom has wrapped his feet.\nCome home! The shades of evening loom\nBeneath the hills, and palely bloom\n   Night-flowers white and sweet.\n</poem>\n\n[[Category:Poems in The Hobbit]]\n[[Category:Songs]]"}}}
