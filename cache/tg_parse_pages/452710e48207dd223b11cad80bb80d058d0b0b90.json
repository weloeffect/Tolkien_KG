Blackham]]. It shows images, maps and drawings of [[Oxford]] as [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] lived it.\n\n==From the Publisher==\n{{blockquote|The buildings and people of Oxford were a valuable source of information for [[The Hobbit]] and [[The Lord of the Rings]]. This absorbing book charts Tolkien's life in Oxford from [[1911]] to [[1973]], using old postcards, maps and photographs to paint a picture of the places and times that relate to one of the leading authors of the twentieth century. The book covers such places as [[The Eagle and Child|The Bird and Baby]], where the [[Inklings]] met to read passages from their work; the Old Ashmolean Building on Broad Street where Tolkien worked on the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]; the University Botanical Gardens opposite Magdalen College, which contained Tolkiens favourite tree under which to ponder; and the [[Wolvercote Cemetery]] where Tolkien was finally buried, with [[Edith Tolkien|his wife]], in [[1973]]. Presented in a handy guide-book format, this is an essential companion for anyone wanting to find the places that influenced Tolkien and his work.}}\n{{title|italic}}\n[[Category:Biography books]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]"}}}
