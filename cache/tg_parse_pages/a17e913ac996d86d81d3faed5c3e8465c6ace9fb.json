By tradition, the Muster of Edoras was under the command of the [[First Marshal of the Riddermark]]. At the time of the [[War of the Ring]], this tradition had lapsed, partly through the schemes of [[Saruman]] and [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]]. Though there was no First Marshal, the Muster did have a leader in [[Elfhelm]], though he did not at that time carry the title of Marshal.\n\n[[Category:Armies]]"}}}
