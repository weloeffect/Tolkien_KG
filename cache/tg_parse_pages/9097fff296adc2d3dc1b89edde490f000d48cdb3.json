It was prompted by Morgoth's attack upon [[Tilion]], the [[Maia]] charged with guidance of the [[Moon]]. [[Evil spirits|Shadowy spirits]] had been sent against Tilion and there had been a battle in [[Ilmen]] that Tilion had won. But although Morgoth had failed in this assault the Valar feared the damage he might yet contrive against Valinor.\n\nTo permanently thwart any attack they caused the [[Pelóri]] to rise up to new and dreadful heights, with outer walls as smooth as glass. In the [[Calacirya]], the only pass permitted through the mountains, strong towers were set. In the ocean the [[Enchanted Isles]] were strewn in the [[Shadowy Seas]] north, east, and south of [[Tol Eressëa]].<ref>{{S|Sun}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally [[Varda]], lifting her hands palms eastward in a gesture of rejection, summoned the vast mists and shadows that made it impossible for any living thing to find again the way westward to the shores of Valinor.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 175}}</ref> In these waters were dark rocks, and in the twilight any mariner would grow weary and loath the sea. If a sailor reached one of the isles he would sleep until the [[Changing of the World|world was changed]].<ref>{{S|Sun}}</ref>\n\nThese defences held fast until [[Eärendil]] with a [[Silmaril]] overcame all obstacles on his voyage to Valinor.<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nurtale Valinoreva}}\n[[Category:Events]]\n[[Category:First Age]]\n[[Category:Quenya names]]\n[[de:Verhüllung von Valinor]]\n[[fi:Valinorin vetäytyminen]]"}}}
