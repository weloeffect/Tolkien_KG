However, at their request, he walked with difficulty towards a hill from where he could see the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]]. By then the ships that Tal-Elmar had seen were too close to the hilly shore to be spotted. Due to the fact that he hated Tal-Elmar and his blunt way of speaking to him, without showing the respect he believed he was deserving, Mogru sent Tal-Elmar ahead to the ships, as a scout.<ref>{{PM|Elmar}}</ref>\n\nThe fate of Mogru it is not known further.\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Second Age characters]]\n[[Category:People of Agar]]\n[[Category:Mannish words]]"}}}
