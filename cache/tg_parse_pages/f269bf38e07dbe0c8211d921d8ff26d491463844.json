In that letter, it appears as part of a postscript reminding Frodo to make sure that the \"[[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]]\" he meets is \"the real Strider\". The poem thus appears in that context as a means of identifying Aragorn. Aragorn indeed later quotes the first two lines, not knowing the poem is in the letter, and this does help to confirm his identity.<ref>{{FR|I10}}</ref>  Bilbo himself recites the poem at the [[Council of Elrond]] when [[Boromir]] expresses doubts about Aragorn's claim to be the [[Heir of Isildur]].<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref>\n\n== Poem ==\n[[File:Christopher Lee - Riddle of Strider.wav|thumb|right|[[Christopher Lee]] reads the Riddle of Strider]]\n:''All that is gold does not glitter,''<br>''Not all those who wander are lost;''<br>''The old that is strong does not wither,''<br>''Deep roots are not reached by the frost.''<br>''From the ashes a fire shall be woken,''<br>''A light from the shadows shall spring;''<br>''Renewed shall be [[Andúril|blade that was broken]],''<br>''The crownless again shall be [[Kings of Gondor|king]].\n== Analysis ==\nThe first line is clearly a re-working of the traditional proverb \"[[:Wikipedia:All that glitters is not gold|All that glitters is not gold]]\", shifting its meaning. The second line, perhaps one of the lines from Tolkien's work most often quoted out of context,<ref>{{webcite|author=Kaitlyn Facista|articleurl=https://www.teawithtolkien.com/podcast/15|articlename=Looking Deeper into Tolkien’s Poetry: “All that is Gold Does Not Glitter, Not All Those Who Wander Are Lost”|dated=2 April 2019|website=[https://www.teawithtolkien.com/ TeawithTolkien.com]|accessed=29 January 2024}}</ref> refers to Aragorn's travels. The third and fourth lines concern Aragorn's heritage, while the remaining lines describe his destiny. The \"blade that was broken\" refers to the [[Shards of Narsil]], which is indeed remade for Aragorn.\n\n== Portrayal in adaptations ==\n'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''\n:Gandalf reads out the Riddle when Frodo reads the letter in Bree.\n\n'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''\n:Although the letter is read aloud, the Riddle is absent. Strider simply tells his name after Frodo reads the words \"His name is Aragorn\". Later, in Rivendell, Frodo uses the line \"the old that is strong does not wither\" to refer to Bilbo, and Arwen says \"From the ashes a fire shall be woken\" when she gives Aragorn Andúril.\n\n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''\n:The last four lines are recited by [[Arwen]] upon her return to [[Rivendell]] as she stands before the Shards of Narsil.  She later encourages [[Elrond]] to re-forge the sword, and presumably to deliver it to Aragorn.\n\n'''2022: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'':'''\n:'''September 23: ''[[Partings]]'':'''\n::The line \"''That not all who wonder or wander are lost''\" is a line within the [[This Wandering Day|song]] that was sung in the [[Rhovanion Hills]] by [[Poppy Proudfellow]] during the [[Harfoots|Harfoot]] migration from the [[Norfield Glen]] to the [[Grove]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Poems in The Lord of the Rings|Poems in ''The Lord of the Rings'']]\n\n{{References}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Riddle of Strider}}\n[[Category:Poems in The Fellowship of the Ring]]"}}}
