When Ted questioned Sam's credibility, Sam stated that his cousin [[Halfast Gamgee]] actually saw one of these [[giants]] which apparently \"was as big as an elm tree, and walking - walking seven yards to a stride\". Ted still questioned the credibility of the rumour.<ref name=\"hobbit\"/>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nIn \"[[The Tale of Eärendel]]\" in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]'', [[Eärendil]] set sail in [[Vingilot]] and had many voyages in his quest to reach [[Valinor]]. During one of these voyages, Vingilot was driven south by the wind into [[Far Harad|dark regions]] and fire-mountains where he encountered \"Tree-men\" alongside [[Haradrim|Sun-dwellers]], [[Pygmies]], and ''[[Sarqindi]]''.<ref name=\"south\">{{LT2|V}}, pp. 254, 261</ref>\n\nIn the first iteration of the conversation at the Green Dragon, Samwise never names the creature, and only used the word \"giants\", describing them as being \"as big as a tower or leastways a tree\".<ref name=\"first\">{{RS|2XV}}, pp. 254</ref> Tolkien changed this phrase soon afterwards, adding the term \"'''Tree-Men'''\" and briefly dropping \"or leastways a tree\" from the sentence.<ref name=\"first\"/> In the second draft of the conversation, Tolkien revised the spelling to '''Tree-men''',<ref name=\"second\">{{RS|3XIX2}}, pp. 319</ref> yet in a later draft, Tolkien spelled the term as '''Treemen'''.<ref name=\"last\">{{RS|3XXII}}, pp. 386</ref> Sometime later, Tolkien changed the term back to Tree-men and the comparison from a tower to an elm tree.\n\nOn [[28 February]] in [[1964]], Tolkien stated in a letter to James Heaf that he did \"not think it was an [[Entwives|Entwife]] which Hal saw on the North Moors\" and suggested that the Tree-man may have been \"a [[Trolls|troll]]\" of some kind.<ref name=\"unpublished\">[https://www.tolkienguide.com/guide/letters/544?q=tag%3AEntwives TCG Letter #544] on the Tolkien Collector Guide</ref> While trolls were never said to be capable of \"walking seven yards to a stride\"<ref name=\"hobbit\"/>, it is possible that some details of the sighting may have been exaggerated by Halfast.\n\n== Portrayal in adaptations ==\n=== ''The Lord of the Rings Online'' ===\nIn the video game ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'', there are many different types of trolls, one of these groups are '''Wood-trolls'''. These Wood-trolls are often mistaken for [[Ents]] and Giants. There is also a quest in the Shire wherein a Hobbit requests that the player investigate sightings of a walking tree in the North Moors. The '''Walking Tree''' in question turns out to be a [[Huorns|Huorn]] that is trapped by [[Spiders]].\n\n===''The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power''===\nIn the [[The Great Wave|fourth episode]] of the first season of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'', [[Galadriel]] tells [[Elendil]] of the stone-giants of the [[North Moors]].<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'', Season One, 4. \"[[The Great Wave]]\"</ref> While the term \"Tree-men\" is not mentioned, it can be inferred that Galadriel is referring to the Tree-men rather than the giants of the [[Misty Mountains]] since in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the Tree-men are described as possibly being akin to giants,<ref name=\"hobbit\"/> and that giants were never said to dwell in the North Moors.\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Characters of unknown race]]\n[[Category:Enigmas]]\n[[Category:Other races]]\n[[Category:Trolls]]"}}}
