Lewis, Wilson's book is: \n\n{{blockquote|the worst book I have ever read about Jack. It is my opinion that though well written in a sort of sensationalist journalism style, it is so full of errors and untruths as to be valueless to any serious scholar. As I have said before, if while studying C.S. Lewis, you read the wrong biography, you wind up studying the wrong C.S. Lewis. You can find yourself trying to make sense out of the study of a completely fictional character. I think the best biography of Jack is ''[[Jack: C.S. Lewis and His Times]]'' by [[George Sayer]].|Douglas Gresham<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.jmm.org.au/articles/9653.htm|articlename=Doug Grasham: Stepson of C.S. Lewis|dated=23 May 2002|website=[http://www.jmm.org.au/ John Mark Ministries]|accessed=29 October 2016}}</ref>}}\n==From the cover/back==\n\n\"An accomplished biography...Wilson is a very clever, fluent, and engaging writer, with many of the traits that he attributes to his subject: a 'constantly intelligent conversational quality,' 'a flair for the quick, sharp character sketch, and a 'bedrock of common sense.'\" THE NEW REPUBLIC\n\nA.N. Wilson shows in this brilliant new biography, that C.S. Lewis, the man, was every bit as multifaceted as C.S. Lewis the writer. Gregerious friend, bullying debater, heavy drinker, and smoker. A man whose relationships with women boggled even those closest to him. C.S. Lewis was all of these things, and A.N. Wilson has succeeded, as no previous biographer has done, in bringing this generous, passionate, opinonated, deeply troubled, and marvelously gifted man to life.\n\nA NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK OF THE YEAR\n{{references}}\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Biography books]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
