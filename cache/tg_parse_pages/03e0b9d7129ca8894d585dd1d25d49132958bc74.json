As for Television, however, I am personally averse to dramatizations of my work, especially of The Lord of the Rings, which is too long for reproduction without severe cutting and editing: in my view destructive, or at best severely damaging to a complicated but closely-woven story'. He regards this mainly as a concern of his publishers, however, and suspects that they would be willing to consider proposals; he directs his correspondent therefore to contact Allen & Unwin: 'Of course if there is a prospect of a television plan being agreed, I should desire very much to see you and consult you later'.<ref name=Christie/>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Letters|Ward, Carole]]"}}}
