It sought to unite the [[Fëanorians]] with the other peoples of [[Beleriand]], including the [[Noldor]] of [[Hithlum]], the [[Dwarves]], the [[Edain]] and the newly arrived [[Easterlings]]. Due to tensions with the [[sons of Fëanor]], [[Nargothrond]] and [[Doriath]] only sent small forces. The alliance was defeated at the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], the Battle of Unnumbered Tears.<ref name=\"Fifth\">{{S|Fifth}}</ref>\n\n==Structure==\nThe Union of Maedhros was divided into two armies in the east and west, led by Maedhros and [[High King of the Noldor|High King]] [[Fingon]] respectively.\n\n===Eastern army===\n*Elves of [[Himring]] ([[Maedhros]])\n*[[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterlings]] under the service of Maedhros ([[Bór]])\n*Easterlings under the service of [[Caranthir]] ([[Ulfang]])\n*[[Dwarves of Belegost]] ([[Azaghâl]])\n\n===Western army===\n*Noldor of [[Hithlum]] ([[Fingon]])\n*[[Men of Dor-lómin]] ([[Húrin]])\n*[[Haladin]] ([[Haldir (Chieftain of the Haladin)|Haldir]])\n*[[Elves of Nargothrond|Elves]] of [[Nargothrond]] ([[Gwindor]])\n*Some [[Falathrim]]\n*[[Mablung]] and [[Beleg]] from [[Doriath]]<ref group=\"note\" name=\"GA\">In [[The Grey Annals]] (§221), Thingol also sends a small force of Grey-elves with Mablung.</ref>\n\n==History==\nAfter the [[Dagor Bragollach]], the [[Noldor]] had lost control over northern [[Beleriand]], and were mostly reduced to enclaves in [[Hithlum]] and [[Nargothrond]], including the hidden [[Gondolin]].<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> When Maedhros heard of the heroic deeds of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] new hope came to him. Maedhros decided to unite the peoples of [[Beleriand]] to assail [[Angband]].\n\nElves, Men and Dwarves joined the alliance. The [[Dwarves]] of the [[Blue Mountains]] supplied both armed forces and forged weapons. Even to [[Gondolin]] came word of the Union and [[Turgon]] the [[Hidden King]] secretly made his own preparations. Other Elves, like [[Orodreth]], refused to join because of the evils of [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]], while [[Thingol]] had sworn never to fight alongside the Feanorians; only a few representatives came from Doriath and Nargothrond. \n\nMaedhros' plans were to lead his army (with some assistance from the western army) to [[Anfauglith]] in order to draw out the armies of Morgoth, and then flank with the hidden forces of Fingon that would emerge from the [[Ered Wethrin]].\n\nInitially, the forces managed to clean of evil creatures [[West Beleriand]] and [[Dorthonion]], and the final assault was planned for [[Midsummer]]. However, Morgoth had time to prepare his forces as Maedhros revealed himself too early, and then [[Uldor]], who was an agent of the Enemy, delayed Maedhros' forces by giving false reports of enemy presence. A small force of [[Orcs]] managed to provoke the western army prematurely, instigated by [[Gwindor]]. As a result, the armies of the Union were themselves outflanked in the ensuing battle, which, despite Turgon's timely and unexpected arrival, would prove disastrous, and would be known as the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]].<ref name=\"Fifth\" />\n\n{{notes}}\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Armies]]\n[[Category:Organizations]]\n[[de:Maedhros’ Bund]]"}}}
