At first the horse did not allow him to come near, and Gandalf had to follow him far over the fields for two days before he tamed him,<ref>{{App|B3}}</ref> chasing him for over twenty miles.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, \"The Council of Elrond\", p. 251</ref> Shadowfax was said to be much faster than the horses of the [[Nazgûl]], and carried Gandalf for about 620 miles from [[23 September|23]] to [[28 September]].<ref>{{HM|RC}}, \"The Council of Elrond\", pp. 252-253</ref> When they reached [[Weathertop]], Gandalf was followed and attacked by the Nazgûl on the night of [[3 October]].<ref>{{HM|RC}}, \"A Knife in the Dark\", pp. 166-8</ref> Shadowfax then carried Gandalf far into the north to distract the Ringwraiths from chasing the Ring-Bearer.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, \"Flight tipo the Ford\", p. 189</ref>\n\nIn [[February]] of [[Third Age 3019|the next year]], Shadowfax returned to [[Edoras]].<ref>{{TT|Riders}}</ref>\n\nShadowfax came alone to Gandalf in the outskirts of the [[Fangorn Forest]] and he introduced the horse to the [[Three Hunters]]. [[Hasufel]] and [[Arod]] recognised him as their chieftain. Shadowfax carried Gandalf and [[Gimli]] to [[Edoras]].<ref>{{TT|White}}</ref> The horse was able to run from Edoras to [[Minas Tirith]] almost without stopping, and his ground speed rivaled the flying speed of the [[fell beasts]] of the [[Nazgûl]].<ref>{{RK|V1}}</ref> Shadowfax was at the [[Grey Havens]] with [[Gandalf]] when he sailed on the [[White Ship]].<ref>{{RK|Havens}}</ref> Shadowfax, as one of the line of [[Nahar]], presumably was with him when sailing for the West.<ref>{{L|268}}, p. 354</ref><ref>{{SD|Epilogue}}, p. 123</ref>\n\nShadowfax also possessed extraordinary courage. He was the only free horse in the world capable of standing before the [[Witch-king|Lord of the Nazgûl]] during the [[Siege of Gondor]] instead of fleeing.<ref name=siege/><ref group=note>This reference excludes horses used by the forces of Sauron such as the horses ridden by the Nine Riders.</ref>\n\n==Appearance and abilities==\n\nShadowfax was described to have a silvery-grey coat which was only visible by day, and seldomly visible by night. He was capable of understanding human speech. As chief of the Mearas, and by extension all horses, he possessed unrivaled speed, strength, intelligence, and endurance, capable of running faster than the wind in comparison to all other steeds, outrunning the Nazgul's horses and equaling the speeds of the winged Fell Beasts, as well as outrun an arrow in flight, and travel over great distances almost entirely without need for rest, and as mentioned above, he had immensely strong willpower and courageousness, enough so to stand up to The Witch-King of Angmar before the gate of Minas Tirith.\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | | | NAH | | | | |NAH=[[Nahar]]<br/><small></small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |:| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |:| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | FEL | | | | |FEL=[[Felaróf]]<br/><small></small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |:| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |:| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | SHA | | | | |SHA='''SHADOWFAX'''<br/><small></small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Etymology==\nIt is an anglicized form of [[Old English]] ''Sceadu-fæx'' 'having shadow-grey mane (and coat)'. It does not actually occur in Old English.

When looking for one, he discovers Shadowfax, as the men of Rohan call him. Gandalf notes his beauty, speed and the fact that that no man had ever rode him. Gandalf tames him and rides him to the Shire and to the [[Prancing Pony]]. He pursues the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] to [[Weathertop]] and rides Shadowfax to [[Rivendell]].\n'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''\n:Shadowfax is not named in the film, but is implied to be Gandalf's horse while riding with the Three Hunters to Edoras, and later appearing with Gandalf riding him again during the [[Battle of the Hornburg]].\n\n'''1980: [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]:'''\n:Shadowfax appears as Gandalf's steed, but is depicted wearing a full harness as opposed to being ridden bareback and without bridle.\n\n'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''\n:Because of alterations to the story, Gandalf rides Shadowfax in pursuit of [[Éomer]] and other banished soldiers of the Rohirrim, rather than seeking survivors of the [[Battle of the Fords of Isen]] or riding to Isengard. Gandalf also rides him into battle alongside Éomer's company, rather than in the company of [[Erkenbrand]] and other men of Rohan on foot.\n\n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''\n:Gandalf's confrontation with the Witch-king, during which he falls from Shadowfax's back in the film, takes place higher in Minas Tirith, rather than at the gate as in the novel. Gandalf also rides him not only into [[Silent Street]], but into house of the Stewards itself in order to rescue [[Faramir]].\n\n'''2012: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Shadowfax accompanies [[Gandalf]] since his return as Gandalf the White.\n\n{{references|notes}}\n\n[[Category:Horses]]\n\n[[de:Schattenfell]]\n[[fr:encyclo:personnages:animaux:chevaux:gripoil]]\n[[fi:Hallavaharja]]"}}}
