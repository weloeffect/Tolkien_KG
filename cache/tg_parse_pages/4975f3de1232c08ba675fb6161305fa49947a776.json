It lay directly adjacent to the bridge across [[the Water]] and next to the [[Old Grange]] as well.\n\n==History==\nIn {{SR|1341}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> [[Bilbo Baggins]] ran by the Mill and a mile beyond to get to the [[Green Dragon]] to meet [[Thorin and Company]].<ref>{{H|Mutton}}</ref> By {{SR|1418}} [[Sandyman]] had been the miller for some time and passed down his craft to his son, [[Ted Sandyman|Ted]]. [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]] bought the mill, and many other buildings in [[Hobbiton]], before he moved in to [[Bag End]]. \n[[File:Matěj Čadil - Hobbiton Befouled.jpg|left|thumb|Hobbiton with the New Mill]]\nShortly after Lotho moved into Bag End, the Mill was knocked down and replaced by a New Mill, operated by Ted Sandyman and several [[Ruffians]]. It was described as \"a great brick building straddling the stream, which it fouled with a steaming and stinking overflow.\" When [[Saruman|Sharkey]] came to [[the Shire]], all grinding stopped. After Sharkey was driven out, this new brick building was demolished.<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn the original version of [[Thorin]]'s letter to Bilbo the rendezvous point for the beginning of the journey to the [[Lonely Mountain]] was the Great Mill.<ref>{{HH|Trolls}}, p. 89</ref> This was only changed to the Green Dragon in the page proofs just before the story was published.<ref name=\"TrollNotes\">{{HH|Trolls}}, note 2, p. 98</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nThe [[Sarehole Mill]] and its millers formed the inspiration for the Old Mill.<ref name=\"TrollNotes\"/>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''\n:The Old Mill is part of the Hobbiton set. The New Mill is visible in [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s vision of the [[Mirror of Galadriel]].\n\n'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''\n:Ted Sandyman operates the Old Mill. [[Sancho Proudfoot]] stole an important pin from the water-wheel, and one of the side-quests is to get it back.\n\n'''2003: [[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|''The Hobbit'' (2003 video game)]]:'''\n:The Mill stands next to the broken bridge. Sandyman cannot fix the bridge because his son [[Sandyman|Carl]] stole his hammer and nails. The nails are on the mill's first floor. [[Bell Goodchild]] hides out at the second floor, only accessible by riding the water-wheel.\n\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Old Mill.jpg|thumb|250px|The Old Mill in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Mill is a prominent landmark in the Shire, directly south of Bag End. [[Ted Sandyman]] can be found outside, but to date he only has lines during some of the seasonal festivals and plays no role in the main story.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Buildings]]\n[[Category:The Shire]]\n\n[[de:Alte Mühle]]\n[[fi:Vanha Mylly]]"}}}
