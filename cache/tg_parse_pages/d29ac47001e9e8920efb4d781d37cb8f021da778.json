Tolkien's Most Popular Epic Fantasies''''' is a collection of essays on [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s writings, edited by [[Jared Lobdell]].\nMost contributors were, like Lobdell, part of the [[University of Wisconsin Tolkien Society]].<ref>[[Jared Lobdell]], ''A Tolkien Compass'', \"Introduction\"</ref>  \n\nThe first edition was published in [[1975]], a second printing followed in [[1980]] and then a revised second edition was released in [[2003]]. The first edition also contained Tolkien's ''[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings]]'' (pp.&nbsp;153–201), but this has been omitted from the second edition due to complaints from the [[Tolkien Estate]], who are the legal owners of the text.  \n\n==First Edition ([[1975]])==\n===From the Publisher===\n{{quote|For those who have dismissed Tolkien's writings as simply escapist literature, the sophisticated tome and perceptive, probing insights of most of the collected articles may be an awakening to a deeper appreciation of these complex classics|The A.R.E. Journal}}\n\nThe intricacies of Tolkien's puns, the moral geography of [[Middle-earth]], the true character of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] and the hobbits' friends and foes, the sheer musical beauty of the names Tolkien invents - all are given careful attention. Tolkien's consuming involvement in his books merits this loving exactness.\n\n[[W.H. Auden]] wrote that he was especially astounded by Tolkien's gift for inventing proper names. Auden would have avidly studied the final offering of this book. For here is a true polestar for all wondering Tolkien fans: Tolkien's own unpublished \"[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings|Guide to the Names in ''The Lord of the Rings'']].\" Originally, Tolkien prepared this guide for translators of his work. Here, he shares his dragon-hoard of etymological treasures. His asides to the reader on how he came to choose some of the names bring us into Tolkien's own studyroom.<ref>[[Jared Lobdell]], ''A Tolkien Compass'', Front endpaper</ref>\n\n===Contents===\n* [[Jared Lobdell]]: \"Introduction\" (dated September [[1974]])\n* [[Bonniejean Christensen]]: \"Gollum's Character Transformation in ''The Hobbit''\"\n* [[Dorothy Matthews]]: \"The Psychological Journey of Bilbo Baggins\"\n* [[Walter Scheps]]: \"The Fairy-tale Morality of ''The Lord of the Rings''\"\n* [[Agnes Perkins]] and [[Helen Hill]]: \"The Corruption of Power\"\n* [[Deborah Rogers|Deborah C.

Tolkien's political, religious, cosmological, and psychological principles are explored by ten writers with different backgrounds and divergent approaches. As leading authority [[Tom Shippey]] observes in his foreword, ''A Tolkien Compass'' lives up to its name by providing vital guidance to both new and seasoned travelers in Middle-earth.\n===Contents===\n* [[Tom Shippey]]: \"Foreword\" (third edition only)\n* [[Jared Lobdell]]: \"Introduction\"\n* [[Bonniejean Christensen]]: \"Gollum's Character Transformation in ''The Hobbit''\"\n* [[Dorothy Matthews]]: \"The Psychological Journey of Bilbo Baggins\"\n* [[Walter Scheps]]: \"The Fairy-tale Morality of ''The Lord of the Rings''\"\n* [[Agnes Perkins]] and [[Helen Hill]]: \"The Corruption of Power\"\n* [[Deborah Rogers|Deborah C.
