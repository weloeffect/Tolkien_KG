Tolkien, the poems and songs which appear in the book are an essential part of its overall magnificence. Trying to furnish England with a mythology he felt it hitherto lacked, and drawing on his own studies of epic poems of the past, including classics such as Beowulf, Tolkien used poetry to add to the magic, mystery and lyricism at the heart of this epic saga.\n\nBringing together all the poems from the work, this expanded edition demonstrates Tolkien's consummate skill as a poet as well as a storyteller. Set apart from the main body of the text, these poems prove delightful in their own right, with each stanza giving an insight into the creation of Tolkien's parallel universe of Middle-earth.<ref name=AMUK>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.amazon.co.uk/Poems-Lord-Rings-J-Tolkien/dp/0261103121/|articlename=Poems from The Lord of the Rings|dated=|website=AMUK|accessed=8 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Publication history and gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"125px\" heights=\"125px\">\nFile:Poems from The Lord of the Rings 1994.gif|1994 first edition\nFile:Poems from The Lord of the Rings 2002.gif|2002 revised edition\n</gallery>\n*[[HarperCollins]] hardcover ([[1994]]), ISBN 0261103121\n*[[HarperCollins]] hardcover ([[2002]]), ISBN 0261103121\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Poems from The Hobbit]]''\n{{references}}\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Books by J.R.R.
