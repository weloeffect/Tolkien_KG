Gorkil was invented by [[Electronic Arts]] for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'', where he was voiced by [[Dave Wittenberg]].\n\n== History ==\nGorkil was a puppet ruler used by [[Sauron]] to hold sway over the disparate tribes and unions among the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains|Orcs of the Mountains]]. From his stronghold in the [[Ettenmoors]], the Goblin King threatened the [[Free peoples|Free Peoples]] of the [[Eriador|North]] and gathered a great following. After a skirmish at his fortress, the forces of [[Glóin]] and [[Glorfindel]] put an end to the Goblin King's reign, and the Orc host was dispersed.\n\n== Spells ==\n* Skull Totem - Places a skull totem which will remain on the map until *destroyed.
