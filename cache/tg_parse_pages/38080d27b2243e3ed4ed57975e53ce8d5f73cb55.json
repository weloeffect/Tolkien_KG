On the other hand, while the letter suggested that the Third Age ended in around 4,000 BC, this calculation pushes it further back.\n\n=== 1964 BBC interview ===\nIn [[November 26]] [[1964]] Tolkien was interviewed by [[BBC]], and during the more informal part of the interview with [[Denys Gueroult]]<ref>''[[The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide]]: Chronology'', p. 625</ref> he offhandedly mentioned that the events of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' happened around 7-8,000 years before present (1964 at the time), somehow consistent to ''The Awakening of the Quendi'' essay:\n\n{{blockquote|The moons, I think, finally the moons and the suns have worked out according to what they were in this part of the world in 1942 actually.
