He shouts to Frodo to destroy the [[One Ring]]. Frodo holds it over the edge, with Sam pleading for him to throw it in the fire, however Frodo becomes visibly more hesitant and anguished; the ring eventually overcomes Frodo, and he turns towards Sam and claims it for his own. An incredulous Sam screams \"No!\" as Frodo puts the ring on and vanishes. Sauron, his folly revealed to him, immediately turns his [[Eye of Sauron|Eye]] towards Mount Doom, and the [[Nazgûl]] are wrenched from the battle at the [[Black Gate]] and fly towards Mount Doom too. \n\nAs Sam searches for Frodo, [[Gollum]] appears behind him and strikes him with a rock. Seeing Frodo's footprints, Gollum jumps on Frodo and bites his finger off in his hunger to reclaim the ring. As a jubilant Gollum stands in triumph holding the ring, the battle at the [[Black Gate]] appears to be going against the [[Army of the West|Host of the West]]. While Gollum dances for joy, a furious Frodo approaches him and tries to reclaim<!-- \"reclaim\" might be a bit of a loaded word... Although it seems to me that Frodo tries to take the ring back from Gollum rather than destroy it here. --> the ring. They struggle with each other and fall over the edge. \n\n==Differences==\nThis scene follows the relevant parts of chapter [[Mount Doom (chapter)|Mount Doom]] incredibly closely with regards to Frodo and Sam, with the exception of its final moments, in which Frodo struggles with Gollum at the edge of the platform. In the book, as Gollum dances with glee after reclaiming the ring from Frodo, he steps over the edge accidentally and falls into the depths.<ref name = \"RKDoom pp.945-6\">{{RK|Doom}}, pp. 945-6</ref> Thus, in contrast to this scene, Frodo plays no active role in the demise of Gollum. The book chapter gives us a deeper insight into the mind of Sauron as Frodo puts the ring on. He suddenly realises the plans of his enemies at this moment and bends all his thought towards the event occurring at [[Mount Doom]], leaving his armies in despair.<ref name = \"RKDoom pp.945-6\"/>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King scenes|70]]"}}}
