Tolkien]] and published in June [[1927]] within ''[[The Stapeldon Magazine]]'' Vol. 7 No. 40 on pages 123-127. Tolkien used the pen name ''Fisiologus''. The poem was reprinted in a revised form as '[[Fastitocalon (poem)|Fastitocalon]]' within ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]''. <ref name=pen>{{AB|Comm}}, pp. 224</ref>\n\nThe name ''Fisiologus'' derives from the work entitled ''Physiologus'', composed by an anonymous author between the second and fourth centuries, which set forth the properties of animals, plants and stones, giving an allegorical interpretation of each in order to illustrate Christian ethical or dogmatic teachings. The ''Physiologus'' had wide influence on medieval symbology and the literary genre of bestiaries.<ref name=pen/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Index:Poems by J.R.R. Tolkien|Poems by J.R.R.
