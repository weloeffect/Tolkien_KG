Tolkien's world. Included are some thirty imaginative and evocative paintings, executed in the years 1978-2006. The paintings, together with the individual and custom-made frames with gothic overtones, may be experienced almost as sculptural objects. This catalogue was published in conjunction with an exhibition at Waldemarsudde 2007, and also includes texts by Dr Gary Smith, Linköping University, Gustav Dahlander, Tolkien Expert and PhD Eva Mendgen at the University of Bonn, Germany}}.\n\n{{references}}\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Art books]]\n[[Category:Exhibition catalogues]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Swedish books]]"}}}
