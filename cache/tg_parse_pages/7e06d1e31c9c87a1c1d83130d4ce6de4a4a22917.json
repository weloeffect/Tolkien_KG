It appears in their third full-length album, [[Third Age of the Sun]].\n==Lyrics==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nWeakest of moments are these \nThe choking hold of insanity \nLoses its grip and cuts me so deep \nWith the knife of clear memories \nOf that innocent past which didn't last \nOh, no! No! \nThe precious of mine \nFor you I would die \nMy love, my life, my everything \nFor you I cry \n\nBut not anymore \nThe things will get better \nI will come to you \nAnd soon we'll be together \nForever...\n</poem>\n\n[[Category:Songs by Battlelore]]"}}}
