It was set up on the mount [[Helcar]] in the northern part of Middle-earth while the other Lamp, [[Ormal]] was set up in the south. It was destroyed by [[Morgoth|Melkor]], and where it fell it created the inland [[Sea of Helcar]].<ref>{{S|III}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe meaning of ''Illuin'' is unclear,<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2875242607.html|articlename=Q.
