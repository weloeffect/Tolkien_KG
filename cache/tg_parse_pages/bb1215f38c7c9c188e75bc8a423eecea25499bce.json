She declared that the dragon killed her father and her people and that she would go alone to the [[Lonely Mountain]] if need be. Dismayed that a child should enter into such peril, Bilbo agreed to go.<ref name=\"video\"/>\n\nAfter Bilbo had killed Slag, Dale was restored. Bilbo and Mika reigned there together for a time before they returned to [[Hobbiton]].<ref name=\"video\"/>\n\n== Etymology ==\nAccording to [[Gene Deitch]], the director of [[The Hobbit (1967 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1967 film)]], the Princess was named after [[Wikipedia:Pete Seeger|Pete Seeger’s]] eldest daughter \"[[Wikipedia:Mika Seeger|Mika]]\". Her second name, \"Milovana\", 'means a beloved woman' in [[Wikipedia:Czech language|Czech]].<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Gene Deitch]]|articleurl=https://genedeitchcredits.wordpress.com/roll-the-credits/40-william-l-snyder/|articlename=William L.
