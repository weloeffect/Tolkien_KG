Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s [[Arda]] by participating on the [[Tolklang]] and [[Tolkien Mailing List]]s. His website, ''[http://lalaithmesp.blogspot.com Lalaith's Middle-earth Science Pages]'', is centred on more obscure aspects of the [[legendarium]] and scientific reasoning on several information Tolkien gives out. His essays concern [[Mannish]] tongues, calendaric calculations, and various geographical topics of [[Arda]].\n\nIn October [[2014]] some of the articles were removed from the site, and were updated and provided as purchasable books. By [[2016]] the Science Pages were moved to another site as blog articles.
