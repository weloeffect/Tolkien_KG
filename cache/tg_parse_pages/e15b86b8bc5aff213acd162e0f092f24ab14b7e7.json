From the high walls westward I looked afar, <br>''\n''But you came not from the empty lands where no men are.’ <br>''\n<br>\n:Then Legolas sang:\n''From the mouths of the [[Bay of Belfalas|Sea]] the South Wind flies, from the sandhills and the stones, <br>''\n''The wailing of the gulls it bears, and at the gate it moans. <br>''\n''‘What news from the South, O sighing wind, do you bring to me at eve? <br>''\n''Where now is Boromir the Fair? He tarries and I grieve. <br>''\n''‘Ask not of me where he doth dwell – so many bones there lie, <br>''\n''On the white shores and the dark shores under the stormy sky, <br>''\n''So many have passed down [[Anduin]] to find the flowing Sea. <br>''\n''Ask of the North Wind news of them the North Wind sends to me!’ <br>''\n''‘O Boromir! Beyond the gate the seaward road runs south, <br>''\n''But you came not with the wailing gulls from the grey sea’s mouth’. <br>''\n<br>\n:Then Aragorn sang again:\n''From the [[Argonath|Gate of the Kings]] the North Wind rides, and past the roaring falls, <br>''\n''And clear and cold about the tower its loud horn calls. <br>''\n''‘What news from the North, O mighty wind, do you bring to me today? <br>''\n''What news of Boromir the bold? For he is long away.’ <br>''\n''‘Beneath [[Amon Hen]] I heard his cry. There many foes he fought, <br>''\n''His cloven shield, his broken sword, they to the water brought. <br>''\n''His head so proud, his face so fair, his limbs they laid to rest, <br>''\n''And [[Rauros]], golden Rauros-falls, bore him upon its breast. <br>''\n''‘O Boromir! The [[Tower of Guard]] shall ever northward gaze, <br>''\n''To Rauros, golden Rauros-falls, until the end of days.' <br>''\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Gimli]] then commented that they left the east wind to him, but he would not sing of it.  Aragorn responded that the people of Gondor endure the east wind but do not ask it for tidings, because in that direction lies [[Mordor]] and the Evil in the East.<ref>{{TT|III1}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2001: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''\n:The song, accompanied by a slow and mournful melody, appears during the watery funeral of Boromir, with Legolas (portrayed by Richard Stanke), Aragorn (portrayed by Boriš Farkaš) and Gimli (portrayed by Vladimír Hajdu) taking turns while singing.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Poems in The Lord of the Rings|Poems in ''The Lord of the Rings'']]\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONMEwDdatSM Lament for Boromir as sung by Adele McCallister]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kM8KIMYv4os Rendition from 2000s Slovak radio series] ''(sung by Richard Stanke as Legolas, Boris Farkaš as Aragorn, Vladimír Hajdu as Gimli)''\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjPxuY9djhw Lament for Boromir - Enhanced Edition - Clamavi De Profundis]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDN1sA3Fpqg Karliene - Lament for Boromir]\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Poems in The Two Towers]]\n[[Category:Songs]]\n\n[[de:Klage um Boromir]]"}}}
