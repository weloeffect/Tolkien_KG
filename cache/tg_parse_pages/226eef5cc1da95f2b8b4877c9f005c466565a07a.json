When their lord [[Olwë]] refused, Fëanor led an assault that became known as the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë|Kinslaying]], in which the blood of many of the Noldor and the Teleri was spilled, before making off with the ships he needed to return to [[Middle-earth]]. \n\nBecause of this event, the [[Valar]] condemned the \"fallen\" Noldor; an emissary (perhaps [[Mandos]] himself) appeared to them in [[Araman]] and pronounced the [[Doom of Mandos|Doom of the Noldor]] and cursed those who did not repent.\n\n[[Maglor]] was the second son of Fëanor, and was present at the Kinslaying, though history does not record what part he played in the battle. He was also famed as the greatest [[Minstrels|minstrel]] and singer of all the Noldor, and he later made a song that lamented the losses at Alqualondë. Its name was ''[[Noldolantë]]'', a name that translates as \"The Fall of the Noldor\".\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Concepts]]\n[[Category:Events]]\n[[Category:First Age]]\n[[Category:Noldor]]\n[[de:Noldolante]]\n[[fi:Noldolantë]]"}}}
