It was released in hardcover in 2005 and in paperback in 2008.\n\n==From the Publisher==\nAlan Lee, the Oscar-winning conceptual designer for the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy, discusses his approach to depicting Tolkien's imaginary world. The book presents more than 150 of Lee's celebrated illustrations to show how his imagery for both the illustrated Lord of the Rings and the films progressed from concept to finished art. In addition, the book contains 20 full-color plates and numerous examples of the conceptual art produced for Peter Jackson's film adaptation. The Lord of the Rings Sketchbook provides a wealth of background information and will be of interest to those who know and love Tolkien's work, from books to films to DVDs, as well as to budding artists and illustrators interested in how to approach book illustration.\n\n{{lordoftheringsfilms}}\n\n{{title|italics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lord of the Rings Sketchbook, The}}\n[[Category:Art books]]\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings (film series) tie-in books]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
