He tells [[Legolas]] and [[Gimli]] that the pace of the [[Uruk-hai]] [[The Breaking of the Fellowship (scene)|who captured Merry and Pippin]] has increased, and that they should make haste. The Three Hunters carry on, following the tracks of the Uruk-hai, until Aragorn suddenly stops, as he has found an [[elven brooch]] on the ground, the same as those that they themselves wear on their [[Elven cloaks|Elven-cloaks]] that they were given as gifts by [[Galadriel]] in [[Lothlórien]]. \n{{blockquote|Not idly do the leaves of [[Lórien]] fall.|Aragorn}}\nThey realize that they are catching up with the Uruk-hai who have captured their young friends and continue on, with Gimli struggling in the chase. Upon climbing to the top of a hill, they look out over the plains of [[Rohan]]. Aragorn asks Legolas what his Elf-eyes can see. The Elf replies, \"The Uruks turn northeast. They are taking the [[Hobbits]] to [[Isengard]]!\"\n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers scenes|05]]"}}}
