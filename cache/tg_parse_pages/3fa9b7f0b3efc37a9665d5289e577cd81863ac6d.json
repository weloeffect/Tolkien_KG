We are always keen to hear your suggestions for improvement, as well as being informed about any potential complaints, problems with content, or copyright violations.\n\nAlthough [[Tolkien Gateway]] was founded by [[User:Hyarion|Hyarion]] he is not directly responsible for the content. Tolkien Gateway does not have an editorial board as it is a collaborative effort by a community of volunteers. \n\n==Copyright violations==\nAs Tolkien Gateway is hosted on a server in the USA, this wiki falls under US jurisdiction (including the principle of [[Tolkien Gateway:Fair use|fair use]]). If you believe [[Tolkien Gateway]] is violating US copyright laws, then please flag that up on the talk page of the individual article/file. Another editor will look into the issue and potentially an [[Tolkien Gateway:Administrators|administrator]] will take further action. \n\n==Contacting individuals==\n<table class=\"TGtable\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;\"><tr><th style=\"background: #F2E6CE;\">User</th><th style=\"background: #F2E6CE;\">Position</th><th style=\"background: #F2E6CE;\">Talk page</th><th style=\"background: #F2E6CE;\">Email address</th></tr>\n<tr><td>'''[[User:Hyarion|Hyarion]]'''</td><td>Founder and webmaster</td><td>[[User talk:Hyarion]]</td><td>{{nospam|hyarion|tolkiengateway.net}}</td></tr>\n<tr><td>'''[[User:LorenzoCB|LorenzoCB]]'''</td><td>Administrator</td><td>[[User talk:LorenzoCB]]</td><td></td></tr>\n<tr><td>'''[[User:Mith|Mith]]'''</td><td>Administrator and webmaster</td><td>[[User talk:Mith]]</td><td></td></tr>\n<tr><td>'''[[User:Ederchil|Ederchil]]'''</td><td>Bureaucrat</td><td>[[User talk:Ederchil]]</td><td></td></tr>\n<tr><td>'''[[User:KingAragorn|KingAragorn]]'''</td><td>Administrator</td><td>[[User talk:KingAragorn]]</td><td></td></tr>\n<tr><td>'''[[User:Morgan|Morgan]]'''</td><td>Administrator</td><td>[[User talk:Morgan]]</td><td></td></tr>\n</table>\n\n[[Category:Tolkien Gateway]]"}}}
