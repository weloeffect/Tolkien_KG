During his youth, he was a friend of [[Saelon]].<ref name=New/>\n\nBerelach served in the [[King's Ships]], and for several years he was stationed at [[Harlond (Gondor)|Harlond]]. He sometimes visited his father at [[Pen-arduin]] to ease his grief and loneliness, often accompanied by [[Saelon]].\n\nDuring the year {{FoA|100}}, his visits became short and not very often, as he had been given a high command, and thus spent many of his days at sea. But even when he was on land, his duty often kept him within [[Pelargir]].<ref name=Lach/>\n\nWhen Berelach had last visited his father before leaving again in [[April]] of {{FoA|103}}, he told him of a recent incident in which a few Shipmen and a small vessel of the Fleet had disappeared. Berelach makes the assumption that the shipmen must have left without leave on some task of their own and drowned. Berelach reasons that the shipmen were unskilled and deserved their fate, serving as evidence that the King's Ships have too few skilled sailers and that fish are more profitable.<ref name=New/>\n\nLater in the month of [[June]], Borlas quoted Berelach's tale to Saelon, only for Saelon to contradict Berelach by saying that the Shipmen were skilled sons of fishermen and that there had been no storms along the coast for a long time.<ref name=New/>\n\nIt is unknown whether it was Berelach or Saelon who spoke the truth of the tale.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''Berelach'' is in [[Sindarin]], however its meaning is unclear. According to [[Paul Strack]], the name might contain the element ''[[lach]]'' (\"leaping flame\").<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1829769541.html|articlename=S.
