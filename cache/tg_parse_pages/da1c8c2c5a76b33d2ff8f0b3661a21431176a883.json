Mitchell quotes from [[Letter to Bruce Mitchell|an undated letter]] from [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] discussing ''[[Beowulf (poem)|Beowulf]]'' (pp.&nbsp;53–4). The author also quotes remarks made by Tolkien during a lecture on ''[[Wikipedia:Book of Exodus|Exodus]]'' (p.&nbsp;340).<ref name=TB>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.tolkienbooks.net/php/details.php?reference=66060|articlename=On Old English. 1988|dated=|website=TB|accessed=21 January 2012}}</ref>\n==From the publisher==\n\nBruce Mitchell is best known for his monumental ''Old English Syntax'' (Clarendon Press, 1985) and (with Fred C. Robinson) for the most popular and widely used introduction to the language and literature of the Anglo-Saxons, ''A Guide to Old English'' (fourth edition published by Blackwell in 1986). But in forty years of studying Old English, Bruce Mitchell has also published essays, articles, and reviews concerned with the interpretation and value of the literature and the way in which grammar—in particular, morphology, syntax, and punctuation—can crucially affect and has affected the translation and understanding of Old English prose and poetry. A selection of these articles is brought together here. The book is divided into five parts concerned with Beowulf, with the poet Caedmon, with The Wanderer, The Seafarer, The Wife's Lament, and other poems, with old English language, and with Old English studies today. This is literary scholarship at its best: readable, to the point, witty, and not infrequently impassioned (as in the author's defense of Beowulf as an optimistic poem). All students and scholars of Old English and Anglo-Saxon England will here find much in this book that will enlighten, stimulate and entertain them.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=6000101522&searchurl=kn%3DOn%2BOld%2BEnglish%2BBruce%2BMitchell%2B1988%26x%3D0%26y%3D0|articlename=On Old English: Selected Papers|dated=|website=[http://www.abebooks.com/ AbeBoooks.com]|accessed=21 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Linguistic books]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
