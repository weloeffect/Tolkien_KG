As he tends the wounds of [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] and [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], he discovers the latter's ''[[mithril]]'' vest. Frodo mentions hearing [[Gollum|flapping feet]], and the Fellowship are quick to conclude that it cannot be an [[orcs|orc]]. Aragorn assures him that whatever it is, it will not follow them where they are going: Lothlórien. Upon hearing that name, [[Boromir]] protests, speaking of the stories of the place that go around in [[Gondor]]. \n\n[[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]] welcome the Fellowship, and inform them that they already know of Gandalf's fall and Frodo's quest. Elves sing a sad song to ''Mithrandir'', and Aragorn and Frodo briefly discuss their memories of him. Frodo is a bit surprised upon hearing so much of Mithrandir and his many names: in the Shire, he was just Gandalf. Aragorn tells him that that was probably the name the Wizard was fondest of. \n\nThe Fellowship rests in Lothlórien, practising their fighting, sleeping, and picking flowers. [[Legolas]] and [[Gimli]] start to bond.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n! Role !!
