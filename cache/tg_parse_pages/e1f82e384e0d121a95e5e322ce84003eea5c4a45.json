So they came to smithing weaponry. The [[Noldor]], renowned steelwrights, crafted sword, spears and axes.<ref>{{S|Noldor}}</ref> Dwarves also made axes; their (doomed) alliance with [[Thingol|Elu Thingol]] made them trade many fine axes, swords and spears with the King of the [[Sindar]].<ref>{{S|Sindar}}</ref> Axes would remain to be the main weapon of the march wardens of [[Doriath]],<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> and were also used by their allies, the [[House of Haleth]] in [[Brethil]].<ref name=\"5B\">{{S|Fifth}}</ref> \n\n==By faction==\n[[File:Artigas - Dwarven Axes.jpg||220px|thumb|''Dwarven Axes'' by [[:Category:Images by Artigas|Artigas]] ]]\n\n* '''[[Dwarves]]''' had the axe as their chief weapon. Dwarven warriors would carry at least one standard axe, though sometimes carried backup weapons as well.<ref>{{H|Burst}}</ref> The [[Dwarves of Belegost]] and their lord, [[Azaghâl]], bore axes.<ref name=\"5B\"/> Axes were also used during the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]]. Durin had a [[Durin's Axe|legendary axe]],<ref name=\"journey\">{{FR|Journey}}</ref> [[Gimli]] bore one,<ref name=\"South\">{{FR|South}}</ref> and [[Dáin Ironfoot]] had a red axe.<ref name=\"Quest\">{{UT|Quest}}</ref>\n\n* The '''Forces of Darkness''' were known to use axes in combat. [[Orcs]] and [[Balrogs]] used it as a weapon in battles. [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]], the Lord of Balrogs himself bore a black axe.<ref name=\"5B\"/> During the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], [[Easterlings]] wielded great axes, and were among the most effective forces of [[Minas Morgul]].<ref>{{RK|Battle}}</ref>\n\n*Among the '''[[Atani]] of the First Age''', the most notable axe-bearers are probably [[Huor]]<ref name=\"5B\"/> and [[Tuor]], whose [[Dramborleg|axe]] became a royal heirloom in Númenor.<ref name=\"Numenor\">{{UT|3a}}, p. 172, note 2</ref> The [[Men of Brethil]] carried little weaponry, but mostly axes.\n\n* '''[[Númenóreans]]''' were passed the craft of weaponsmithing by the [[Noldor]], and they managed to forge great axes. Their main purpose seems to have been not in war, but in deforesting the woods of [[Middle-earth]] for ship-timber.<ref name=\"Description\">{{UT|Numenor}}</ref>\n\n==Notable axe-wielders==\n* [[Dáin Ironfoot]]<ref name=\"Quest\"/>\n* [[Dorlas]]<ref name=\"Narn\"/>\n* [[Durin]]<ref name=\"journey\"/>\n* [[Gimli]]<ref name=\"South\"/>\n* [[Huor]]<ref name=\"Coming\"/>\n* [[Húrin]]<ref name=\"5B\"/>\n* [[Sador]]<ref name=\"Narn\">{{UT|Narn}}</ref>\n* [[Tuor]]<ref name=\"Coming\">{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Weapons]]"}}}
