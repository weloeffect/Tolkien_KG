This incensed Ar-Pharazôn who decided to force Sauron to become his vassal by force and to claim the title King of Men for himself.<ref name=Akallabeth/>\n\nAr-Pharazôn sailed with a great armada to Middle-earth, set up a camp with his mighty army and sent envoys to Sauron demanding him to come and to swear fealty to him. When Sauron realized that he could not prevail be force, he decided to use manipulation and came and swore featly to Ar-Pharazôn. Ar-Pharazôn took Sauron with him back to Númenor as a hostage, but Sauron managed to gain the trust of Ar-Pharazôn and to become the closest counsellor of the king. Ultimately Sauron succeeded in convincing Ar-Pharazôn who feared death that breaking the [[Ban of the Valar]] and living in [[Aman]] would grant him immortality. When a Númenórean armada saild to Aman and an army landed the [[Valar]] asked [[Ilúvatar]] to intervene and the island of Númenor sank below the waves, the armada fell into an abyss and their army was buried [[Caves of the Forgotten|under collapsing hills]] in Aman.<ref name=Akallabeth/>\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Other titles]]"}}}
