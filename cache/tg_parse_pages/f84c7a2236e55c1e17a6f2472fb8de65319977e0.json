Tolkien]]; it explores the meanings of the [[Old English]] word ''ofermod'', which appears in the original Old English fragment ''[[wikipedia:The Battle of Maldon|The Battle of Maldon]]''. The word is used to describe Beorhtnoth's state of mind at one point in the fragment - Tolkien took the word to mean that Beorhtnoth was a victim of overweening pride (a character flaw that would appear in several of Tolkien's later characters, [[Fëanor]] and [[Túrin]] perhaps being the best examples).\n\n==Publication history==\nThe essay was originally published in [[1953]] along with Tolkien's alliterative poem \"[[The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth|The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm's Son]]\" and another essay titled \"The Death of Beorhtnoth\". \n\nIt has since been republished in the [[2001]] (and later) editions of ''[[Tree and Leaf]]''.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://valarguild.org/varda/Tolkien/encyc/papers/dreamlord/stages/ofermod.htm \"Modes of the Heroic: ''ofermod'' as Tragic Motif\" at Valarguild.com]\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Published articles by J.R.R.
