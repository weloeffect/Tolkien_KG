Most of the Trolls present at the battle were killed, with a very few escaping. \n\n==Appearance==\nThe Olog-hai had none of the old Troll vulnerabilities: they were very intelligent and able to endure the [[Sun]]. For this reason they were seen by some to be giant [[Orcs]] (though surpassing even the [[Uruk-hai]] in size and power), but they were definitely of Troll stock.<ref name=Other/>\n\nThe Olog-hai that fought in the War were described as being taller than a man, and covered in horny scales, carrying hammers and bucklers in their claws.<ref name=Gate/>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Olog-hai'' is a term out of the [[Black Speech]]. ''[[Olog]]'' means \"troll\" and ''[[hai]]'' (as in ''[[Uruk-hai]]'') means \"folk\".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 136</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/orkish.htm|articlename=Orkish and the Black Speech|dated=|website=Arda|accessed=13 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nThe original name for these creatures (in the fourth draft of [[Appendix F]]) was ''Horg-hai'', which was changed to ''Olg-hai'' before finally appearing as ''Olog-hai'' in the published text.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:Angus McBride - Black Trolls.jpg|thumb|''Black Trolls'' by [[Angus McBride]]]]\n'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''\n: Olog-hai, also called ''Black Trolls'', were bred by Sauron from lesser Troll stock.

These Olog-hai were not shown talking in any speech other than grunts. They differ from the other Trolls depicted in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Peter Jackson's ''The Lord of the Rings'']] in that they have more forward-facing eyes as well as hair on their bodies, suggesting that they are a more advanced form of Troll. They are usually gray to black in color. They have twenty-four teeth. Their eyes are also bright orange, showing their evil connection with Sauron.\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Black Speech words]]\n[[Category:Trolls]]\n[[Category:Servants of Sauron]]\n[[de:Olog-hai]]\n[[fr:encyclo/peuples/trolls/olog-hai]]\n[[fi:Olog-hai]]"}}}
