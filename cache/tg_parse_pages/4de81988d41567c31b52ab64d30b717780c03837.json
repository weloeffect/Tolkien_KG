A disciple of the [[Fifth of the Nazgûl|Blind Sorcerer]], he was a central figure in the political and religious subversion of the region of [[Sîrayn]] during the [[Third Age]], serving as the ''Taraskon'' ([[Languages in Middle-earth Role Playing#Tazinain|Ta.]] \"Wisdom-lord\") of the city of [[Tûl Isra]].\n\n==Biography==\nTartas Izain was born in Isra to a Haradan lord and an abducted Elven maiden in {{TA|1350}}. At some point<ref group=\"note\">Both sources say {{TA|1383}}, but he would be well over 23 by then</ref>, his mother died of a disease, and the following year he was sent to his uncle Shuftas Gabar in [[Charnesra]]. Under his uncle's tutelage, Tartas began his training in the dark arts, quickly surpassing his instructor.\n\nAt the age of 23, Tartas received an emissary from [[Ny Chennacatt]] inviting him to train under the Blind Sorcerer. He departed a year later. During this time, he was tutored in advanced sorcery and initiated into the worship of the [[Sauron|Dark Lord]]. Upon his departure at the age of 34, Akhôrahil gifted him a [[Lesser rings|lesser ring]] to prolong his life.\n\nTartas then infiltrated the ruling council of Tûl Isra together with clan Bulgan, and was appointed Taraskon in {{TA|1385}}. He revitalized the floundering cult of Taimaraud, a God of the Dead, by corrupting them into worship [[Sauron|Silent One]], with temples to the Silent One appearing by {{TA|1397}}.\n\nHis reign lasted until {{TA|1436}}, when Clan Másra regained the throne of Tûl Isra, forcing the sorcerer to flee to Charnesra. Seeking revenge, Tartas convinced his uncle Shuftas Gabar to launch an unannounced attack on his former city, but Charnesra ends up being destroyed.\n\nFollowing his military failure, Tartas returned to Ny Chennacatt. He remained there until {{TA|1627}}, when he returned to Tûl Isra to serve again as the Taraskon.<ref>{{ICE|8205}}, p. 5</ref><ref>{{ICE|8205}}, p. 22</ref><ref>{{ICE|3111}}, p. 27</ref>\n\nWhen clan Bulgan was once again overthrown in {{TA|1641}}, he fled to Ny Chennacatt. As punishment, he was decapitated and his ring was given to warlord [[Army of the Southern Dragon#Utchû|Utchû]].<ref>{{ICE|8205}}, p. 15</ref><ref>{{ICE|8205}}, p. 24</ref>\n{{References|notes}}\n[[Category:Middle-earth Role Playing characters]]"}}}
