He was originally one of the Men of Angmar, the Angmarim, but became the second-in-command of the [[Blackwolds]], and eventually their chieftain. \n\nHe led an attack on [[Archet]], attempting to find the treasure they were looking for from two [[Hobbits]]. He managed to slay the town's captain, [[Jon Brackenbrook|Jon Brackenbrook's]] father, but was wounded himself in the attack. He fled after he learned the two Hobbits staying in Archet weren't the ones he was looking for.<ref>{{VGC|SAIB}}</ref>\nHe is also responsible for a [[Goblin]] invasion in [[the Shire]].\n\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Eogan}}\n[[Category:Men from adaptations]] \n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings Online characters]]"}}}
