During the evening when Thorin called for music, Dori (along with Nori and Ori) played the flute.<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref>  \n\nBilbo proclaimed Dori to be \"really a decent fellow\"<ref name=\"Pan\">{{H|Pan}}</ref> because thrice Dori assisted Bilbo when the hobbit might otherwise have been killed:  First, Dori carried Bilbo in the tunnels of the [[Misty Mountains]] during the escape from the goblins, but unfortunately dropped him which led to the hobbit's encounter with Gollum.<ref name=\"Hill\"/> Upon Nori's discovery that Bilbo was gone the other Dwarves blamed Dori for losing their burglar, especially the wizard [[Gandalf]] arguing with the dwarf.  Second, during the escape from the [[Wargs]], Dori climbed down from a tree, which allowed Bilbo to scramble up Dori and into the tree.  Lastly, Bilbo grabbed Dori's legs as they were carried off by an eagle, saving them from a fire lit by Goblins, much to both Bilbo and Dori's dismay crying \"My legs! My poor legs!\".<ref name=\"Pan\"/>\n\nWhen [[Gandalf]] was telling the story of the company's adventures to [[Beorn]], Dori and Thorin were the first two Dwarves to show up.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref> Thorin also notes that Dori is the strongest of their company. Upon being pulled out of the barrel after escaping the [[Thranduil|Elvenking]]'s halls and arrived in [[Lake-town]], Dori, along with several others was one of the Dwarves who was waterlogged and seemed only half alive.<ref>{{H|Welcome}}</ref> \n\nDori would later fight in and survive the [[Battle of Five Armies]].  He was given his share of the treasure by [[Dáin Ironfoot]], the new king under the mountain after Thorin's death at the battle by [[Bolg]], and made his home in Erebor alongside his other companions that survived the battle and would live in great wealth under King Dáin.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>\n\n===Later life===\nDori lived a wealthy life after the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. His date of death is unknown but he was still alive during the [[War of the Ring]], as mentioned by [[Glóin]] before the [[Council of Elrond]] in {{TA|3018}}.<ref name=\"Meetings\"/> He probably fought in the [[Battle of Dale]] against [[Sauron]]'s forces, the [[Easterlings]], along with the other members of the company still alive.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Dóri'' is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''.

Bilbo also holds onto his leg (much to his chagrin) while the [[Eagles]] are flying the Company to safety. Later, after reclaiming Erebor, you see the dwarves celebrating as Dori jokingly says about him being king under the mountain, though Thorin dismisses the dwarf's joke.
