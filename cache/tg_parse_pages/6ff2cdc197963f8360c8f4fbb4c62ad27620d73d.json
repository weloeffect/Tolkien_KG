Tolkien]]. Its companion volume is ''[[Light Beyond All Shadow|Light Beyond All Shadow: Religious Experience in Tolkien's Work]]''.\n\n==From the publisher==\n{{blockquote|The conversation, sometimes heated, about the influence of Christianity on the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien has a long history. What has been lacking is a forum for a civilized discussion about the topic, as well as a chronological overview of the major arguments and themes that have engaged scholars about the impact of Christianity on Tolkien's oeuvre, with particular reference to ''The Lord of the Rings''. ''The Ring and the Cross'' addresses these two needs through an articulate and authoritative analyses of Tolkien's Roman Catholicism and the role it plays in understanding his writings. The volume's contributors deftly explain the kinds of interpretations put forward and evidence marshaled when arguing for or against religious influence. ''The Ring and the Cross'' invites readers to draw their own conclusions about a subject that has fascinated Tolkien enthusiasts since the publication of his masterpiece, ''The Lord of the Rings''.}}\n\n==Contents==\n*Introduction (Paul E.
