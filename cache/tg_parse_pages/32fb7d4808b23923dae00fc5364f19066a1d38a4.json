Since Fëanor had imprisoned in them the light of the [[Two Trees of Valinor]], which illuminated [[Valinor|that land]], these jewels acquired an exceedingly special value, and Fëanor became obsessed with love of his artworks and guarded them jealously, seldom permitting anyone else, except maybe [[Sons of Fëanor|his seven sons]], to look at them.<ref>{{S|Feanor}}</ref> However, when [[Morgoth]] contrived to destroy the Trees by poisoning them with the aid of [[Ungoliant]],<ref name=\"Darkening\">{{S|Darkening}}</ref> their light unsullied now was only preserved in the Silmarils, which Morgoth had stolen from Fëanor's treasury.<ref name=\"Concerning\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Darkening of Valinor]], as the Trees were dying, the [[Valar]] asked Fëanor to surrender the Silmarils and break them. By the pure light they contained, the Trees could, as the Valar said, be healed again. However, Fëanor refused their prayer, and when the Valar commanded him to relinquish the jewels (since the light which gave them their beauty and sanctity was theirs, and had only been lent to him) he became obdurate and rebelled, foreswearing his allegiance to [[Manwë]] as the Elder King of [[Arda]].<ref name=\"Concerning\"/><ref name=\"Darkening\"/>\n\nTo Fëanor, the Silmarils had become symbols and instruments of his power, and thus he bestowed upon himself the title of the \"lord of the lights\".<ref name=\"Concerning\"/>\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Elven titles]]\n[[Category:Noldor]]"}}}
