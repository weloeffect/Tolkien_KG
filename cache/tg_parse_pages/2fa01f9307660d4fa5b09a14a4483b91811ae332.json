Tolkien]] submitted ''[[The Hobbit]]'' for publication, and Unwin paid his ten-year-old son [[Rayner Unwin|Rayner]] a few pence to write a report on the manuscript. Rayner's favourable response prompted Unwin to publish the book. Once the book became a success Unwin asked Tolkien for a sequel, which eventually became ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n\nTolkien wished to publish his mythology ([[The Silmarillion]]) after ''The Hobbit''. In late [[1937]] Unwin examined the Quenta Silmarillion, the [[Lay of Leithian]], and other manuscripts, but he and critic Edward Crankshaw thought it was unsuitable for publication, especially in its current form.<ref>{{L|19}}</ref><Ref group=note>It is possible that the ''Quenta'' that Unwin saw was the one published as ''[[Quenta Silmarillion (Lost Road)|Quenta Silmarillion]]'' in ''[[The Lost Road]]''.</ref> Unwin didn't reject the ''Silmarillion'', but instead of being published as a mythology, he proposed that it should rather be used as source to write \"further books like ''The Hobbit''\".<ref>{{HM|LB}}, p. 366</ref><ref name=comp/>{{rp|p. lxxi}}\n\nTolkien liked Rayner but, as he said, didn't like much his father, despite their friendly relations. He resented the rejection of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and considered giving ''The Lord of the Rings'' to [[Milton Waldman|another publisher]] who would accept to publish both works; but he felt morally obliged to Unwin because of his promise for a sequel, and their personal friendship, and proceeded with him.<ref>{{L|123}}, p. 135</ref> On the matter of publishing both works, Rayner suggested to his father to have one of Tolkien's sons to edit some parts of the ''Silmarillion'' for publication with the ''Lord of the Rings'' and later drop it. This infuriated Tolkien who put an ultimatum to Unwin, to which he replied \"no\" as he didn't have enough time.<ref name=comp>{{HM|RC}}</ref>{{rp|p. xxx}}<ref>{{L|127}}</ref> This started a feud between Tolkien and Allen & Unwin.\n\nUltimately Tolkien wasn't able to reach an agreement with Waldman either, so he compromised.<ref>{{L|133}}, p. 163</ref> In November [[1952]] Unwin was on a business trip in the Far East when his son telegraphed him saying that publication of the ''Rings'' was the work of a genius but would be risky; to which Stanley replied \"If you believe it is a work of genius, ''then'' you may lose a thousand pounds\".<ref name=comp/>{{rp|p. xxxii}}\n\n==Bibliography, selected==\n*[[1960]]: ''The Truth about a Publisher'' (includes mention of the publishing of ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'')\n\n==See also==\n*[[Rayner Unwin]]\n*[[Allen and Unwin]]\n*[[Letter to Stanley Unwin]]\n{{references|n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Unwin, Stanley}}\n[[Category:British people]]\n[[Category:Letter receivers]]\n[[Category:People by name]]\n[[Category:Publishers (people)]]\n[[de:Stanley Unwin]]\n[[fi:Stanley Unwin]]"}}}
