He has been existing eternally in the [[Timeless Halls]] and possesses the [[Flame Imperishable]] in his spirit which kindles existence from nothingness.\n\n== The Creator ==\n[[Image:Ted Nasmith - Melkor Weaves Opposing Music.jpg|thumb|left|Eru during the [[Great Music]], art by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nEru created the [[Ainur]] before anything else, whom he kindled with the Flame Imperishable. Each Ainu came from a part of his mind. To further their comprehension, he presented his thought in the form of music, and listened as the Ainur picked up his themes and elaborated on them, slowly learning to sing in harmony with each other. Eventually he showed them his greatest theme, and made them sing it in harmony and develop it with newly granted powers. This was the [[Music of the Ainur]].\n\nOut of this great music, Eru showed them the [[Vision of Ilúvatar|Vision]] which showed vast halls of spaces and stories unfolded in the deeps of Time, and some Ainur were drawn to it. Eru said \"''[[ea (verb)|eä]]''\" (\"let it be\") and thus [[Eä]], the universe, was created.<ref>{{S|Ainu}}</ref>\n\nUpon creating Eä he also created and fixed the natural laws and physical rules (''[[axan]]i'') in which it will function, limited within impossibilities (''[[únat]]i'') that can't be broken by any being, no matter how powerful or evil.<ref>{{NM|P2ix}}, pp. 205-218</ref> Ilúvatar also set and fixed the conditions of the World (''[[Ambarmenie]]'') in which the creatures would live.<ref>{{NM|P2xi}}, p. 226</ref>\n\n==The God==\nThe Ainur entered Eä and shaped the world according to the Music. Eru delegated most direct action within [[Eä]] to the Ainur, including the shaping of the Earth ([[Arda]]) itself.<ref name=S1>{{S|1}}</ref>\n\nThe Ainur were not omniscient and there were some things beyond their comprehension; those were the creation of the [[Elves]] and [[Men]], who are directly the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] (''[[Eruhíni]]'') created without the delegation of the Ainur. Other things known by Eru alone are their destiny, and [[the End]] itself.\n\nThe activities of Eru in regard to the life of Arda or Eä are not clear. [[Manwë]] was the [[Wikipedia:vicegerent|vicegerent]]<ref name=S1/> of Eru on Arda and it is known that he sought for his consent several times, like before the creation of the [[Ents]]<ref name=aule/> or before the [[Battle of the Powers]].<ref>{{S|3}}</ref> Instances of Eru's direct intervention were:\n\n*Sanctified the creation of the [[Dwarves]] by [[Aulë]], giving them life and sapience, and were his adopted Children.\n*At the behest of [[Yavanna]], he allowed the [[Ents]] into being.<ref name=aule>{{S|Aule}}</ref>\n*The creation of the Eruhíni, the [[Awakening of the Elves]] and the [[Awakening of Men]].\n*[[Beren]] crossing the [[Girdle of Melian]] and meeting [[Lúthien]]<ref>{{S|17}}</ref>\n*The [[Changing of the World|Númenórean Catastrophe]],<ref name=\"NM|P3xv\">{{NM|P3xv}}</ref> something that the Valar themselves could not have done.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> \n*Several coincidences and signs of a higher providence throughout history, such as [[Bilbo Baggins]] finding the [[One Ring]].<ref>{{FR|I2}}, Gandalf: \"Behind that there was something else at work, beyond any design of [Sauron].

[[Noldorin|N]] {{IPA|[iˈluːvatar]}}, [[Vanyarin|V]] {{IPA|[iˈluːβatar]}}) is [[Quenya]] for \"Father of All\", more commonly referred to as Eru '''Ilúvatar'''.\n\nThe name ''Ilúvatar'' is a compound of two words, ''[[ilu]]'' or ''[[ilúvë]]'' (\"all, universe\") and ''[[atar]]'' (\"father\").\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n{{quote|'Ilúvatar was the first beginning, and beyond that no wisdom of the [[Valar]] or of [[Eldar]] or of [[Men]] can go.'<br>'Who was Ilúvatar?' asked [[Eriol]]. 'Was he of the [[Gods]]?'<br>'Nay,' said [[Rúmil (elf of Tirion)|Rúmil]], 'that he was not, for he made them. Ilúvatar is the '''Lord for Always''' who dwells beyond the world; who made it and is not of it nor in it, but loves it.' |''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]'', \"[[The Music of the Ainur]]\"}}\n\nIlúvatar appears since the earliest form of the Legendarium, in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. It is to be noted that in [[Qenya]] the name ''Ilúvatar'' meant \"Sky-father\" since the element ''il-'' refers also to the sky (cf. [[Ilmen]]), but this etymology was dropped in favour of the newer meaning in later revisions. Another name, less used, was '''''Ainatar''''' (\"Holy Father\").<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry \"Ainur\"</ref>\n\nThe word ''Eru'' first appeared as an [[Adûnaic]] word: '''''Êru'''''.<ref>{{SD|2eiii}}</ref> It was first used as a [[Quenya]] word in a [[Ainulindalë (Morgoth's Ring)#Alteration in last revision 1951|list of names]] of 1951.<ref>{{MR|P1}}, p. 7</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nTolkien understood Eru not as a \"fictional deity\" but as a name in a fictional language for the actual monotheistic God, although in a mythological or fictional context. In a draft of a letter of [[1954]] to Peter Hastings, manager of the Newman Bookshop (a Catholic bookshop in [[Oxford]]), Tolkien defended non-orthodox aspects as rightly within the scope of his mythology, as an exploration of the infinite \"potential variety\" of God. Regarding the possibility of reincarnation of [[Elves]], Hastings had written:\n{{blockquote|God has not used that device in any of the creations of which we have knowledge, and it seems to me to be stepping beyond the position of a sub-creator to produce it as an actual working thing, because a sub-creator, when dealing with the relations between creator and created, should use those channels which he knows the creator to have used already|Peter Hastings}}\n\nTolkien's reply contains an explanation of his view of the relation of (divine) Creation to (human) [[sub-creation]]:\n{{blockquote|We differ entirely about the nature of the relation of sub-creation to Creation. I should have said that liberation \"from the channels the creator is known to have used already\" is the fundamental function of \"sub-creation\", a tribute to the infinity of His potential variety [...] I am not a metaphysician; but I should have thought it a curious metaphysics &mdash; there is not one but many, indeed potentially innumerable ones &mdash; that declared the channels known (in such a finite corner as we have any inkling of) to have been used, are the only possible ones, or efficacious, or possibly acceptable to and by Him!|J.R.R. Tolkien, [[Letter 153]], pp. 188-189}}\n\nHastings had also criticized the description of [[Tom Bombadil]] by [[Goldberry]]: ''\"He is\"'', saying that this seemed to imply that Bombadil was God. \t \n\nTolkien replied to this:\t \n{{blockquote|As for Tom Bombadil, I really do think you are being too serious, besides missing the point. [...] You rather remind me of a Protestant relation who to me objected to the (modern) Catholic habit of calling priests Father, because the name father belonged only to the '''[[Wikipedia:God the Father|First Person]]'''.|J.R.R.
