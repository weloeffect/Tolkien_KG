Barliman Butterbur believed that they had been let into Bree by Harry Goatleaf and Bill Ferny, which had been on the side of the ruffians and which had fled Bree with them after they had lost the fight against the inhabitants of Bree, but three Men and two Hobbits from Bree were killed. The defeated ruffians fled to the woods beyond Archet and the wilds where they lived as robbers so that travelling on the road was no longer safe. As a result the inhabitants of Breeland locked up their dwellings early, kept watchers all around the hedge and guarded the gates with a lot of men during the night. He also informed them that the Bree-landers had not understood how much the Rangers of the North had done for their safety, because after they all left (to fight in the War of the Ring in the south) wolves had howled around the fences in the winter and there were dark shapes in the woods, dreadful things that make the blood run cold when he thought of them.<ref name=\"Homeward\">{{RK|Homeward}}, p. 992</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Archet'' is an \"English place-name of [[Celtic]] origin.<ref name=\"Nomenclature\">{{HM|N}}, entry '''Archet''', p. 765</ref>\n\nThe name ''Archet'' has been modelled on a relic of a \"British\" (i.e. Celtic) name that was chosen for its meaning, because the survival of traces of the older language of the Bree-men resembled the survival of Celtic elements in England. The element ''chet'' means \"wood\".<ref name=\"Nomenclature\" /><ref>{{App|Translation}}, p. 1135</ref> [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] stated that the name ''Archet'' was descended from British ''*ar(e)cait-'' and that [[Welsh]] ''argoed'' means \"trees\" or \"edge of forest\".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 765 citing from [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], manuscript version of ''Nomenclature of The Lord of the Rings'', entry '''Archet'''</ref>\n\n[[Mark T. Hooker]] suggests that the element ''[[Wiktionary:ar-#Old Irish|Ar-]]'' is a prefix meaning \"nearby\", found in several [[Welsh]] place-names. The meaning of ''Archet'' would thus be \"near the woods\", which Hooker notes describes its geographic position \"''on the edge of the Chetwood''\".<ref>[[Mark T. Hooker]], ''[[A Tolkienian Mathomium]]'', p. 8</ref>\n\n[[David Salo]] suggests that ''Archet'' means \"by the wood\" and that it is equivalent to Welsh ''Argoed''.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=https://tolkienlistsearch.herokuapp.com/message/5e9c35b63ee6a6c41e9862d6|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]|accessed=2022-09-22}}</ref>\n\nThe real-life [[Welsh]] place-name ''[[Wikipedia:Argoed|Argoed]]'' means \"by a wood\".\n\n==Portrayals in Adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Archet map.jpg|thumb|250px|Map of Archet from ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Archet is the settlement players start at if they are Hobbits or of the Race of Man.
