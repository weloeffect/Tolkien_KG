Yazneg was invented by [[Warner Bros.]] for [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]], where he was portrayed by [[Wikipedia:John Rawls (actor)|John Rawls]].\n\n== History ==\nAfter spotting the Company of [[Dwarves]] camping out in the [[Lone-lands]], Yazneg sent [[Fimbul]] to inform Azog that they found Thorin and his Company. Later, the Orc troop catches up with Thorin near [[Rivendell]], but are distracted by [[Radagast]] and his rabbit sled. However, during the chase, one of the hunters spotted where Thorin and his Company were hiding. The orcs then encircle the dwarves and attempt to attack them, but are forced to retreat due to an unexpected attack by [[Elrond]] and his [[Elves|Elven]] forces. Yazneg and Fimbul return empty-handed to Weathertop, where Azog ultimately throws Yazneg to the pack's [[Wargs]] to feast upon, as an example for the rest not to fail him.\n\n== Etymology ==\nYazneg is not a name created by Tolkien and its derivation isn't explained within the films. However [[David Salo]], who worked as a linguistic consultant for [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]], provides an Orkish wordlist on his blog which glosses ''yaz'' as \"name\" and ''-neg'' as \"without\".<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://midgardsmal.com/yrksk-ordabok/|articlename=Yrksk Orðabók|author=[[David Salo]]|dated=7 January 2014|accessed=28 December 2017|website=[http://midgardsmal.com/ Midgardsmal]}}</ref>\n\n== Other versions ==\nYazneg's appearance was derived from early concept designs for Azog in the film that were never used.<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://atolkienistperspective.wordpress.com/2013/12/16/azog-bolg-and-yazneg-the-trios-tangled-design-history/|articlename=Azog, Bolg … and Yazneg: The trio’s tangled design history|dated=16 December 2013|accessed=17 June 2017|website=[http://atolkienistperspective.wordpress.com A Tolkienist Perspective]}}</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Orcs from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Hobbit (film series) characters]]\n\n[[fi:Yazneg (elokuvahahmo)]]"}}}
