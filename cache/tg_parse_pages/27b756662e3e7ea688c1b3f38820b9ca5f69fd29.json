They produced milk, which was used as a beverage in [[Gondor]],<ref>{{HM|RK}}, \"[[The Siege of Gondor]]\"</ref> and [[the Shire]].<ref>{{HM|H}}, \"[[An Unexpected Party]]\"</ref> Being generally stronger than [[horses]], cows also pulled the heavier wagons and wains in Middle-earth.<ref name=\"MT\">{{HM|RK}}, \"[[Minas Tirith (chapter)|Minas Tirith]]\"</ref>\n\nYet still, there were undomesticated oxen. The wild-oxen of the East were, according to legend, descended from the [[Kine of Araw]], the herd of [[Oromë]].<ref name=\"AA\">{{HM|AA}}, \"The Realms in Exile\"</ref> [[Vorondil the Hunter]] hunted them in the far fields of [[Rhûn]], and of their horns he made the [[Great Horn]] of Gondor, which served as an heirloom to the House of Stewards until its destruction.<ref name=\"MT\"/>\n\n==Inspiration==\nCows are a major source of food even in today's world. Their use as farm animals seems little more than logical. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] spent most of his life in [[Oxford|'''Ox'''ford]], and cows would also play a role in other stories, such as ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'', where [[the Giant]] steps on [[Farmer Giles]]' favourite cow, [[Galathea]].<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Tales from the Perilous Realm]]'' (2008 edition), \"[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]\"</ref>\n\nThe white oxen of [[Rhûn]] were likened by Tolkien to an ''[[wikipedia:Aurochs|aurochs]]'',<ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond]], [[Christina Scull]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', page 265</ref> a bovine species common in the ancient and medieval world until its extinction.\n\n==Etymology==\nAn \"elvish\" word for \"bull\" is ''[[mundo]]''.<ref>{{L|342}}</ref> The [[Sundocarme|Root]] MBUD, which lists among its derivatives a [[Quenya]] word ''mundo'' meaning \"snout, nose, cape\",<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, root MBUD</ref> could perhaps be related to ''mundo''.\n\nIn [[Qenya]], the word for \"ox\" is ''[[yakko]]'' or ''yako'', \"cow\" is ''[[yaksi]]'' or ''yakse''. In [[Noldorin|Gnomish]], \"milch cow\" is ''[[gach]]'', \"cow\" is ''[[gacha]]'', and \"a yoke ox - bullock\" is ''gagron''. Other Gnomish names are ''mûs'' or ''mui'' (\"cow\"); ''muir'' (\"heifer\"); ''[[mû]]'' (\"ox\"), ''muin'' (\"kine, cattle\"); and ''[[mugli]]'' (\"calf\").<ref>{{PE|12}}, p. 105</ref><ref>{{PE|11}}, pp. 36, 58</ref>\n\nIn Tolkien's juvenile language [[Nevbosh]], the word for cow is ''woc'', which is both the reverse of ''cow'', and an alteration of the French word ''vache''.<ref>[http://www.uib.no/people/hnohf/nevbosh.htm Nevbosh article] in [[Ardalambion]]</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''[[2001]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''\n:A cow can be seen being milked by a Hobbit.
