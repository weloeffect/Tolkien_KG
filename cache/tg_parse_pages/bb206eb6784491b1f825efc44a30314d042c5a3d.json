While [[Aragorn]] and the forces of [[Gondor]] were away, the city remained shrouded in fear. [[Faramir]] met Lady [[Éowyn]] in the [[Houses of Healing]]. Éowyn longed for Aragorn and the chance to fight with the [[Éored|Riders]] of [[Rohan]] against [[Mordor]]. Her sadness, mixed with pride and beauty, led Faramir to fall in love with her. For days, they stared to the east, waiting for word of Gondor’s success, until they eventually saw the Darkness break. As sunlight broke through the sky, the citizens of Minas Tirith broke out in song. Messengers soon arrived telling of Aragorn’s victory.<ref>{{RK|Cormallen}}</ref> The conflict resolved, Éowyn’s longing for war faded, and she and Faramir agreed to wed.\n\nWhen Aragorn returned, Faramir rode out of the gate of Minas Tirith and offered him the keys of the city and [[Crown of Gondor|an ancient crown]]. To everyone’s amazement, Aragorn called for the [[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]] and [[Gandalf]]. [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] handed the crown to Gandalf, who placed it upon Aragorn’s brow.\n\nThe city of Minas Tirith began to revive. Its walls were restored, and the city was filled with trees, fountains, and laughter. Ambassadors from many lands arrived in Gondor, and Aragorn showed mercy by rewarding both the faithful and the enemies of the West. Gandalf explained that the [[Third Age]] of [[Middle-earth]] had passed: the war against [[Sauron]] was over, and Aragorn’s reign in the [[Dominion of Men|age of]] [[Men]] had begun. The group climbed up an ancient, snowy path, at the end of which, amidst a pile of debris, Aragorn found a sapling of the great [[White Tree of Gondor|White Tree]]—the symbol of ancient [[Elendil]], Gondor’s kingdom. Aragorn took the sapling back to the Citadel. The old, dead tree was removed and laid to rest, and the new one planted in its place.\n\nThe day before Midsummer, a group of [[Elves]] approached Minas Tirith. [[Celeborn]] and [[Galadriel]], [[Elrohir]] and [[Elladan]], and all the Elf princes arrived in the city. Behind them, mightiest of all, was [[Elrond]] with his daughter, [[Arwen]]. On the day of [[Midsummer]], Aragorn (now called King [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]]) and Arwen were wed.\n{{references}}\n[[Category:The Return of the King chapters|Steward and the King]]\n[[fi:Käskynhaltija ja kuningas (TSH)]]"}}}
