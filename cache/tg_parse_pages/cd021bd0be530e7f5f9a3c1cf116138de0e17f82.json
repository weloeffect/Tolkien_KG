During this time, the [[First War]] was fought between [[Melkor]] and the rest of the Valar, and Melkor had the upper hand. But [[Tulkas]], a great spirit of strength, was sent to [[Arda]], and Melkor fled before him. Thus there was peace for a time. \n\nThe initial shape of Arda, chosen by the Valar, was of a symmetrical continent lit by two lamps wrought by [[Aulë]] the Smith, filled with light by [[Varda]], and hallowed by [[Manwë]]: [[Illuin]] in the north, and [[Ormal]] in the south. Seeds of growth were planted by [[Yavanna]] which grew to fruition over Arda as greenery, grasses, and trees. The lamps illuminated all the Earth, with both lights mixing in the centre at the dwelling of the Valar: the isle [[Almaren]] in the middle of the [[Great Lake]]. \n\nBut as the Valar rested from their toils, [[Morgoth|Melkor]] delved, in secret, the fortress of [[Utumno]] beneath the mountains in the north. He came forth suddenly, taking the Valar at unawares, and destroyed the lamps. Thus the symmetry of Arda was marred, and Almaren was laid to ruin. Melkor fled to Utumno before the wrath of Manwë and Tulkas, and the Earth groaned in their wake. The might of the Valar was then put towards saving their labour, and they feared to put forth their power like so again, for they knew not where or when the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] would awake.\n\nThe [[Spring of Arda]] ended; the world was darkened, and split into two main continents: [[Aman]] in the far West, and [[Middle-earth]] to the East, separated by the [[Great Sea]]. It was in Aman where the Valar made their new abode, and they raised up the [[Pelóri]] mountains as a fortification against Melkor, across the Sea of [[Belegaer]], in [[Middle-earth]]. Manwë, chief of the Valar, set his throne upon the highest peak of the Pelóri: [[Taniquetil]]. Thus the Valar made for themselves a home in the utmost West, in [[Aman]], which is called [[Valinor]], and established the city of [[Valmar]]. \n\nMelkor hid himself from the Valar in [[Utumno]], which, after the marring, was in the north of [[Middle-earth]]. He surrounded himself with beasts of terror, many of them [[Maiar]] in the form of [[Balrogs]]. These were to remain some of his most faithful, and dreadful, servants. \n\nAt this time, all was dark. So, upon the mound of [[Ezellohar]] in Valinor, [[Yavanna]], with the aid of [[Nienna]], brought forth the [[Two Trees]]: the elder [[Telperion]], with fluttering leaves of shining silver, and the younger [[Laurelin]], from which shone forth a radiant, golden light. Thus began the [[Days of Bliss]] of Valinor, and the [[Time|Count of Time]]. \n\n==External links==\n* [http://forum.barrowdowns.com/showthread.php?t=13301 Chapter discussion at BarrowDowns.com]\n\n[[fr:tolkien/resumes/silm/qs1]]\n[[fi:Aikojen alku (Silmarillion)]]\n[[Category:The Silmarillion chapters]]"}}}
