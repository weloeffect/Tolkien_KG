Tolkien|Tolkien]]-branch editor, [[Chris Smith]]. This guide contains information coming from both books and [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|Peter Jackson's movies]]. It contains a foreword by [[Christopher Lee]] and an introduction by [[Weta Workshop]]'s [[Richard Taylor]]. \n\n== From the publisher ==\nLavishly illustrated with 1,000 photos, paintings, maps, sculptures and sketches, most appearing here for the first time, Weapons and Warfare is an indispensable chronicle of The Lord of the Rings' many creatures, warriors, armies and battlegrounds. From the graceful and proficient Elves to the horrendous war machines of the Dark Lord, each culture's approach to warfare is explained -- how they fought, why they were fighting, what armor they wore and what weapons they used against their enemies. Now you can get as close to a marauding Orc as you could ever wish, without suffering the consequences! Treating the filmmakers' notes, designs and props as a true archive, Weapons and Warfare describes in detail every major conflict depicted in the film trilogy -- from The Last Alliance of Elves and Men to the climactic Battle of the Pelennor Fields -- each accompanied by a battle diagram from the films' chief designers. Armed with a wealth of fascinating facts and unique imagery, and with an exclusive foreword by Christopher Lee and an introduction by the Academy Award winner Richard Taylor, Weapons and Warfare promises to be the most striking companion to The Lord of the Rings movie trilogy published to date.\n\n==Contents==\n''The Lord of the Rings: Weapons and Warfare'' is composed of these chapters:\n\n# ''The History of the War of the Ring''\n# ''The Last Alliance of Elves and Men''\n# ''The Dead Marshes''\n# ''The Elves of Second Age''\n# ''Gil-galad''\n# ''Elrond''\n# ''Númenóreans''\n# ''Elendil''\n# ''Range Weapon Comparison chart''\n# ''Isildur''\n# ''Mordor Orcs of the Second Age''\n# ''The Last Alliance - battle plan''\n# ''Weathertop''\n# ''Hobbits''\n# ''Moria - The War of the Dwarves and the Orcs''\n# ''Dwarves''\n# ''Gimli''\n# ''Cave-troll''\n# ''The Orcs of Moria''\n# ''Gandalf''\n# ''The Balrog''\n# ''Moria - plan''\n# ''Amon Hen''\n# ''Rohan''\n# ''Wild Men of Dunland''\n# ''Wargs & Warg-riders''\n# ''The Defense of Helm's Deep''\n# ''Forging Swords''\n# ''Men of Rohan''\n# ''King Théoden''\n# ''Éomer''\n# ''Éowyn''\n# ''Legolas''\n# ''Elves of Lothlórien''\n# ''Uruk-hai''\n# ''Helm's Deep - battle plan''\n# ''Saruman''\n# ''Isengard''\n# ''Rangers of Ithilien''\n# ''Faramir''\n# ''Bows of Middle Earth''\n# ''Gondor''\n# ''Men of Gondor''\n# ''Denethor''\n# ''Boromir''\n# ''The Fountain & Citadel Guard''\n# ''Orcs and Mordor''\n# ''The Nazgûl''\n# ''The Siege of Gondor''\n# ''Grond & Other Siege Equipment''\n# ''Mountain-Trolls''\n# ''Easterlings''\n# ''The Battle of Pelennor Fields''\n# ''Haradrim''\n# ''Mûmakil''\n# ''The Corsairs of Umbar''\n# ''The Dead Men of Dunharrow''\n# ''The Siege of Gondor/Battle of the Pelennor Fields - battle plan\n# ''The Black Gate of Mordor''\n# ''The Mouth of Sauron''\n# ''Aragorn''\n# ''Sauron''\n# ''The One Ring''\n\n==Reviews==\n* [http://www.monstersandcritics.com/books/reviews/article_71.php/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_Weapons_and_Warfare_Review Review at Monsters and Critics]\n\n{{lordoftheringsfilms}}\n\n{{title|italics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lord of the Rings: Weapons and Warfare, The}}\n[[Category:Art books]]\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings (film series) tie-in books]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
