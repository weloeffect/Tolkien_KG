Tolkien|J.R.R. Tolkien's]] later [[legendarium]] and as such, Lungorthin may have been abandoned as he never appeared within any of Tolkien's writing after ''The Lay of the Children of Húrin''.\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Balrogs]]\n[[Category:Noldorin names]]\n[[Category:Servants of Melkor]]\n\n[[de:Lungorthin]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/ainur/maiar/balrogs/lungorthin]]\n[[fi:Lungorthin]]"}}}
