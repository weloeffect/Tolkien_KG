It was widely rumuored that Pearl was the attendant in question. As a formal expression of displeasure, Pearl was excluded from the accession ceremony of [[Ferumbras Took III|Ferumbras]], who had been waiting to become head of the clan for quite a while (he had already been Thain since the death of his father). She was, however, afterwards spotted with a necklace of pearls believed to be a Took family heirloom.<ref name=\"L214\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nPearl's name follows the Hobbit custom of high-class women being named after jewels.<ref>[[Jim Allan]] (ed.), ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', \"Giving of Names\"</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Hobbits]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[Category:Took]]\n[[de:Perle Tuk]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/hobbits/touque/perle touque]]\n[[fi:Helmi Tuk]]"}}}
