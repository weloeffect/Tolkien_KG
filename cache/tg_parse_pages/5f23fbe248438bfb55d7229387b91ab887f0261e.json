It was published as No. 30 in the ''[[Cormarë Series]]''.\n\n==From the publisher==\n\n{{blockquote|Following in the footsteps of the previous publication, [[Tolkien's View|Tolkien's View: Windows into his World]], Professor J.S. Ryan in this latest collection of essays pursues Professor Tolkien's narrow path through the Nameless Wood of uncharted territory between academic research and mythcreation culminating in the writing of the 20th century's masterpiece, The Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>Having himself studied under Professor J.R.R. Tolkien and having written for no less than 50 years on his inspirational teacher, his sources and the applicability of his writings, J.S. Ryan is uniquely placed to reflect not only on Tolkien the Scholar or Tolkien the Author, but equally on Tolkien the Man.}}\n\n==Contents==\n\n* Preface\n* Introduction\n* List of Abbreviations and References\n* 'The Nameless Wood' and 'The Narrow Path'\n* '''Part A - The Ancient Middle East and its Associations'''\n** Indo-European Race-Memories and Race-Fears from the Ancient City of Uruk ... and so to Tolkien as the quietly Speculative Philologist\n** Oath-Swearing, the Stone of Erech and the Near East of the Ancient World\n** Saruman, 'Sharkey' and Suruman: Analogous Figures of Eastern Ingenuity and Cunning\n** Túrin, Turanian and Ural-Altaic Philology\n** Gollum and the Golem: A Neglected Tolkienian Association with Jewish Thought\n* '''Part B - Romano-British Lydney and its Remarkable Importance for Tolkien's Œuvre'''\n** The Lydney Archaeological Site and Tolkien's Portrayal of the King as Healer\n** The Mines of Mendip and of Moria, with some Reflections on The Lair of the White Worm\n** Dwarf's Hill and the 'Dwarf's Chapel' ... the Matter of the Ancient Mining There and the Ideas for Further Story that that Fabled Activity might well have Engendered\n** Ancient Mosaic Tiles from out the West: some Romano-British 'Traditional' Motifs\n* '''Part C - The North and West Germanic Tradition and Christianity'''\n** Frothi, Frodo - and Dodo and Odo\n** The Knee and the Old English Gifstol as Sacral Symbols of Protection and of Forgiveness\n** King Alfred's Developing Concept of 'Wisdom' and its Relevance to Tolkien's Grand Moral Philosophy\n** Uncouth Innocence - some Links Between Chrétien de Troyes, Wolfram von Eschenbach and J.R.R.
