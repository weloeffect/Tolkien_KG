Beyond the lake, Langwell and the nearby Wyrmsgráf river both drop from a great height in two spectacular waterfalls collectively called the \"Twainmantle\". Together with the nearby \"Reikfoss of [[Greylin]]\" waterfall, they are known as \"the Three Sisters\" and raise a large cloud of mist into the air, giving the surrounding area its name: \"Misthallow\".\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Rhovanion]]\n[[Category:Rivers]]\n[[de:Langquell]]\n[[fi:Ylä-Pitkä]]"}}}
