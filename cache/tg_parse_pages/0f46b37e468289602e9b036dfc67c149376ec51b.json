Tolkien]]. The book was written by [[Catherine McIlwaine]], Tolkien archivist at the [[Bodleian Library]]. It was timed to coincide with an exhibition of the same name, also curated by McIlwaine.\n\nThe book documents Tolkien's creative processes behind his [[Middle-earth]] books with essays by Tolkien scholars and a catalogue of his artworks, each image accompanied by a descriptive and historical text. With some 300 illustrations, mainly in double-page spreads of image and text, it draws on the collection at the Bodleian Library, [[Marquette University]], and private collections, some of which were never previously viewable by the public. The book and exhibition have been widely admired by commentators.\n\nIt was published with its companion volume ''[[Tolkien: Treasures]]''.\n\n==Overview==\nThe book is divided into two parts. The first part is a series of essays on key aspects of Tolkien's Middle-earth creation. There is a brief biography of Tolkien by McIlwaine, and a chapter by [[John Garth]] on how [[the Inklings]], a literary group that included [[C. S. Lewis]], influenced Tolkien. [[Verlyn Flieger]] describes Tolkien's concept of ''faerie'', referencing works such as ''[[On Fairy-Stories]]'' and ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]'' as well as his Middle-earth books. [[Carl F. Hostetter]] introduces Tolkien's invented Elvish languages, [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]]. [[Tom Shippey]] comments on Tolkien's creative use of Norse mythology, and the northern ethos of courage without hope of victory, citing ''[[Beowulf (poem)|Beowulf]]'' and the ''Poetic Edda'''s Lay of Fafnir, to suit his own taste, faith, and knowledge of philology. Finally, [[Wayne Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] introduce Tolkien's visual art, arguing that his artwork was as thorough as his writing.<ref>[http://journal.finfar.org/articles/book-review-tolkien-maker-of-middle-earth/ Book Review: Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth] (accessed: 11 June 2022)</ref>\n\nThe second part is a catalogue of the exhibition, divided into chapters covering Tolkien's letters, his childhood, student days, inventiveness, his long effort on ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' myths, his work at home, ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and his maps of Middle-earth. It provides some 300 illustrations, mainly in double-page spreads of image and text. Some are from the collection at the Bodleian Library; others are from the archive at [[Marquette University]] and from private collections.<ref>[https://www.tolkiensociety.org/events/exhibition-tolkien-maker-of-middle-earth/ Exhibition: Tolkien – Maker of Middle-earth] (accessed: 11 June 2022)</ref>\n\n==Contents==\n*Foreword\n*Essays\n**\"J.R.R.
