Five issues were published before its editor moved on to ''[[Mallorn (journal)|Mallorn]]''.\n\n==History==\nThe idea of ''Weathertop'' came to [[Denis Bridoux]] and [[Kay Woollard]] (Dora Baggins), co-founders of Amon Sûl Smial, on the journey back from [[Oxonmoot 1984]]. In the early '80s, many smials started producing their own magazines, and neither were very impressed by the quality of what was on offer at the time. \n\nFrom the beginning, Amon Sûl Smial had always attracted people with artistic leanings, and it still does. Producing a magazine would give them an opportunity to show what they could do and all the members were quite enthusiastic. For smial members, 'amateur' was definitely not synonymous with amateurish or poor quality. It was agreed that, if they were to produce a magazine themselves one day, it would have to look good, and to give equal importance to text and to artwork, which was done throughout the existence of the magazine.\n[[File:Weathertop 3 Letter fragment.jpg|thumb|left|Feedback received from [[Pauline Baynes]]]]\n\nOver a 3 year period, ''Weathertop'' was released around the time of [[Oxonmoot]] and/or the [[Tolkien Society]]'s Annual General Meeting. Among notable texts, it published an article by [[Rhona Beare]] (in ''Weathertop'' 2) and \"''Belladonna by Belladonna''\" by [[Vera Chapman]], (in ''Weathertop'' 3-5). The magazine received good feedback for as long as it ran.\n\nSadly the magazine ran only for 5 issues, as it prepared Denis Bridoux to propose editing ''[[Mallorn (journal)|Mallorn]]'' when its then-editor, Jenny Curtis, expressed the desire to stop producing it. He took its editorship over from issues [[Mallorn 23|23]] to [[Mallorn 27|27]], until a change of job led him to pass it on himself.\n\n==List of issues==\n* Winter [[1984]]-[[1985|85]]: [[Weathertop 1|''Weathertop'' 1]]\n* Spring [[1985]]: [[Weathertop 2|''Weathertop'' 2]]\n* Autumn 1985: [[Weathertop 3|''Weathertop'' 3]]\n* Autumn [[1986]]: [[Weathertop 4|''Weathertop'' 4]]\n* Autumn [[1987]]: [[Weathertop 5|''Weathertop'' 5]]\n\n==Presentation in first issue==\n{{Blockquote|Weathertop is the magazine of Amon Sûl Smial and is published quaterly.
