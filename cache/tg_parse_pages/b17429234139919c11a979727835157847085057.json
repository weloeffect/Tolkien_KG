It stood on the [[East Road]], between the [[Three-Farthing Stone]] (fourteen miles to the west) and the [[Brandywine Bridge]] (twenty-two miles to the east). Immediately to the north of the village, the stream known as [[The Water]] broke into two, creating a wide watery region.<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref>\n\nUntil the [[War of the Ring]], the village seems to have been most notable for its inn, [[The Floating Log]]. During the brief time when [[Saruman]] took over the Shire, though, it became the home of the [[First Eastfarthing Troop]] of Shirriffs, and it was here that the returning [[Travellers]] were \"arrested\" on [[1 November]] {{TA|3019}}<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref> and brought to the [[Shirriff-house]] of the village on their journey back to [[Hobbiton]].<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name is analysed as ''frog'' + ''moor'' (\"marshy land\") and ''ton'' (\"town, village\")<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 771</ref> obviously referring to a marshy land at the division of [[The Water]]. Based on this, [[David Salo]] has suggested a speculative [[Old English]] etymology from *''Froggameretun'' meaning \"town by the frog-pool\".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=https://tolkienlistsearch.herokuapp.com/message/5e9c35b63ee6a6c41e9862d6|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]|accessed=9 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nThere is a [[wikipedia:Frogmore|Frogmore]] in [[wikipedia:Buckinghamshire|Buckinghamshire]], which contains an estate (and burial ground) of the [[wikipedia: British Royal Family|British Royal Family]].\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Frogmorton.jpg|thumb|left|Frogmorton in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Frogmorton is located in a swampy area, where a great many frogs can indeed by found.\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Cities, towns and villages of the Shire]]\n\n[[de:Froschmoorstetten]]\n[[fi:Sammakkosuo]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/villes tours et forteresses/comte/lagrenouillere]]"}}}
