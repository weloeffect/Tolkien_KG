Grimbold placed all the riders for whom horses were available under the command of Dúnhere to cover the retreat of his forces to the south in the night after the [[Second Battle of the Fords of Isen]].<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref>\n\nDúnhere did not accompany [[Gandalf]] and Erkenbrand to the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], but went to [[Edoras]] instead. [[Gandalf]] counselled him and the other captains to assemble the riders of Rohan in Harrowdale and to await King [[Théoden]] there, rather than in the open fields around Edoras, and to light as few fires as possible. Several days later, [[Théoden]] and the rest of the riders mustered there for the ride to [[Minas Tirith]].<ref name=Muster/>\n\nDúnhere was slain at the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. He was remembered in the [[Song of the Mounds of Mundburg]].<ref>{{RK|Battle}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Dúnhere'' means \"hill warrior\" in [[Old English]], consisting of ''[[Wiktionary:dun#Old English|dūn]]'' (\"hill\") + ''[[Wiktionary:here#Old English|here]]'' (\"army, host\").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 571</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| |,|-|-|-|.| | |}}\n{{familytree| ERK | | UNK | |ERK=[[Erkenbrand]]<br /><small>''fl. {{TA|3019}}''</small>|UNK=''unknown sibling''}}\n{{familytree| | | | | |!| | |}}\n{{familytree| | | | | DUN | |DUN='''DÚNHERE'''<br /><small>''d. {{TA|3019}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Dúnhere.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Dúnhere in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2015: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Dúnhere is the Lord of [[Dunharrow]] and a nearby small village of [[Underharrow]]. He left his wife Ellen Fremedon in charge before departing with [[Erkenbrand]] for the Fords. The player sees Dúnhere shortly before the [[battle of Helm's Deep]] but not does get a chance to interact with him. They do not meet properly until the [[Druadan Forest]] on the day before the Rohirrim army arrives to [[Minas Tirith]]. Dúnhere is slain by an arrow during the [[battle of the Pelennor Fields]].\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dunhere}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:Rohirrim]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n\n[[de:Dúnhere]]\n[[fi:Dúnhere]]\n[[fr:encyclo:personnages:hommes:3a:hommes du nord:rohirrim:dunhere]]"}}}
