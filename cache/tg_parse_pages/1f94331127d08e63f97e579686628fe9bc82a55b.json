They were the first Gondolindrim to confront those who attempted to enter the city through the [[Seven Gates of Gondolin|Seven Gates]].<ref name=SilmMaeglin>{{S|Maeglin}}</ref><ref name=Tuor>{{UT|Tuor}}, pp. 45-50</ref> \n\n== History ==\nIn the year {{FA|400}}, [[Aredhel]], returning to Gondolin with her son [[Maeglin]], was happily received by the Dark Guard. However, [[Eöl]] had followed them from a distance, discovering the secret entrance into the city. The Dark Guard was taken by surprise when Eöl revealed his presence to them while traversing the [[Orfalch Echor]] by stealth. After he claimed that Aredhel was his wife, the Guard brought him before [[Turgon]] in the [[Tower of the King]].<ref name=SilmMaeglin/>\n\nYears later, the Dark Guard was approached by [[Tuor]] and [[Voronwë]] in their cavern in front of the Outer Gate, the Gate of Wood. Their captain, [[Elemmakil]], was amazed that his friend Voronwë would bring a mortal [[Man]] with him. He announced that he should, by law, slay him. Voronwë and Tuor answered that they came at the command of [[Ulmo]]. As Elemmakil guided the two through the Seven Gates, they passed the guard divisions of the other gates.<ref name=Tuor/>\n\nOn the inner side of the [[Gate of Steel|Last Gate]], an unknown number of Elves representing the Dark Guard were stationed at the high sward overlooking [[Tumladen]]. They stood with an army of soldiers that contained representatives from each of the Seven Gates.<ref name=Tuor/>\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{gondolin}}\n\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Gondolin]]\n[[Category:Gondolindrim]]\n[[Category:Noldor]]\n[[Category:Organizations]]"}}}
