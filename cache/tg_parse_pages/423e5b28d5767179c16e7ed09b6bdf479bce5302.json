Based on the statements that the distance due East from the [[Morgai]] to [[Mount Doom]] is 80 miles on The Third Map<ref>{{SD|IIIg}}, p. 34 and 35</ref> and that the [[Little Lune]] was first marked on the third and last of J.R.R.

Contour lines are used for the mountains and hills on that map that was drawn by J.R.R. Tolkien. That map uses map-squares of 2 centimetres side and a scale of 2 centimetres (one square) for 100 miles.<ref>{{webcite|author=J.R.R.
