The [[Ringwraiths]] embark from [[Minas Morgul]] towards the Shire.\n\nGandalf leaves [[Frodo]] and the [[Shire]], crossing [[Middle-earth]] to the land of [[Gondor]], hoping to see the archives of [[Minas Tirith]]. Gandalf arrives and begins looking at the various scrolls in the archives. It is not long before he finds one authored by [[Isildur]] himself, the last person to see the [[One Ring]] before it vanished. Isildur describes the Ring's appearance and how fiery letters appear when the Ring is heated. Gandalf realizes he must test Frodo's ring by using fire.\n\nA Ringwraith is shown asking a [[Hobbit]] for \"Baggins.\" The Hobbit nervously tells him that the Bagginses live up in [[Hobbiton]].\n\n==Differences==\nAs a result of the time compression discussed earlier, Gandalf's search for information regarding the One Ring is drastically shortened from the time it takes in the books. [[Denethor]], who has a brief appearance when this scene is described at the [[Council of Elrond]], is omitted. The language on Isildur's scroll is slightly different than that of the book, but not substantially.\n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring scenes|08]]"}}}
