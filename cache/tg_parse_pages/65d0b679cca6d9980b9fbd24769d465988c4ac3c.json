At a distance of about 50 [[lár]]i west of the [[Gap of Rohan]], the Isen was joined by its tributary river, the [[Adorn]].<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref> The [[Greenway|North-South Road]] ended on the western shore of the [[Fords of Isen]].<ref>{{HM|UI}}, entry ''Greenway'', \"originally running from Isengard to Fornost\", p. 31</ref> There, the Isen passed in two arms around a large eyot. The Fords of Isen were the only place south of [[Isengard]] where large armies, escpecially if they were mounted or heavily armed, could cross over the Isen.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, p. 356</ref> About a mile east of the gates of Isengard, a bridge had been built over the Isen where it ran through a very deep channel.<ref>{{TT|Flotsam}}, p. 566</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn the [[Third Age]], the Isen and the [[Adorn]] formed the western boundary of the Kingdom of [[Rohan]], but the triangle of land between Isen, Adorn, and the [[White Mountains]] was a contested land, claimed by the [[Rohirrim]] as well as the [[Dunlendings]] during certain periods of the [[Third Age]].<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, Note 4, p. 364</ref>\n\nThe Isen formed a natural boundary in the [[Gap of Rohan]], and was only crossable at Isengard or at the [[Fords of Isen]], where the Rohirrim fought a number of great battles against the [[Dunlendings]] and [[Saruman]]'s [[Orcs]] in the late Third Age.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref>\n\nThe mouth of Isen was the northernmost landing point of the fleets<ref name=\"Beren\">{{App|Stewards}}, entry for Steward Beren, p. 1054</ref> of the [[Corsairs of Umbar|Corsairs]]<ref name=\"Eorl\">{{App|Eorl}}, entry for King Helm, p. 1066</ref> from [[Umbar]] and [[Harad]] that assailed the coasts of [[Gondor]] in {{TA|2758}}<ref name=\"Beren\" /> and aided the Dunlendings against [[Rohan]]<ref name=\"Eorl\" />.\n\nWhen the [[Ents]] attacked [[Isengard]], they dammed the Isen and other springs and streams in [[Nan Curunír]], and dug trenches to divert the river's flow, before breaking the dams and temporarily drowning all of Isengard.<ref>{{TT|Flotsam}}, p. 568 and pp. 570</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Isen'' represents the [[Westron]] name of the river, albeit archaic in form. It is an old variant form of English \"iron\". The river's name ''Isen'' is derived from (the first element of) ''[[Isengard]]'', the fortress at its source.<ref name=\"Nomen\">{{HM|N}}, entry '''Isengard, Isenmouthe''', pp. 772-3</ref>\n\nThe [[Sindarin]]<ref name=\"Eldamo\">{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-2407588721.html|articlename=S. ''Sîr Angren'' loc.|website=Eldamo|accessed=26 November 2024}}</ref> name of the river was ''[[Sîr]]'' ''[[anga|Angren]]'',<ref name=\"WifeNote\" /> which means \"River of Iron\"<ref name=\"Eldamo\" />. It is probable that the river's name in Sindarin was also derived from the first element of ''Angrenost'', the Sindarin name of the fortress at its source.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Isen.jpg|thumb|250px|Isen in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:To the north of the [[Fords of Isen]], both east and west banks of the Isen are explorable.
