Lauro''' is a researcher and independent scholar. His unpublished PhD thesis from the [[wikipedia:University of St Andrews|University of St Andrews]] was a treatment of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s philosophy of [[Mythopoeia]] <ref>{{webcite|author=Reno E. Lauro|articleurl=http://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/3207|articlename=\n''Beyond the colonization of human imagining and everyday life: crafting mythopoeic lifeworlds as a theological response to hyperreality''|dated=30 November 2012|website=[http://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/ St Andrews Research Repository]|accessed= 9 December 2019}}</ref> as a response to Jean Baudrillard's Hyperreality. His work makes connections between Tolkien, the medieval aesthetics of light, and the philosophy of [[wikipedia:Martin Heidegger|Martin Heidegger]]. Reno contends that Tolkien modified Barfield's notion of Ancient Semantic Unity and developed his own Ontological Semantic Unity in the Legendarium. Rather than a literary endeavor, Tolkien applied the Medieval aesthetics of light to an already involved asterisk history of Elves and Men. Tolkien can only be understood, he says, by taking his cosmological ontology at face value as a true recovery of enchanted forms of life for an Age of the Machine.\n\nReno has run the substack page [https://tolkienshouseofbeing.substack.com/ Tolkien's House of Being] since 2019, and its associated [http://www.facebook.com/Tolkiens-House-of-Being-103629977785291/ Facebook page].\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Articles===\n* [[2006]]: ''[[J.R.R.
