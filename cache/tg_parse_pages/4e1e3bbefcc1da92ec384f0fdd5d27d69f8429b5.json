Tolkien]]. It is one of several early poems concerning [[Eärendil|Eärendel]] published in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]''.<ref name=\"LT\">{{LT2|V}}, \"[[The Tale of Eärendel]]\", pp. 269-271</ref>\n\nThe short (36 lines in its final version) poem consists of an exhortation to recount the tale of \"Eärendel the wandering\" - perhaps referring to ''[[Éalá Éarendel Engla Beorhtast]]'' composed earlier that year - and a reply from the eponymous minstrel. Four drafts were written at [[59 St John Street|St John Street]], [[Oxford]] in the winter of [[1914]]. Earlier titles were ''The Minstrel renounces the song'' and ''The Lay of Eärendel''.\n\n==Poem excerpt==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">'Sing us yet more of Eärendel the wandering,\nchant us a lay of his white-oared ship,\nmore marvellous-cunning than mortal man's pondering,\nfoamily musical out of the deep.</poem>\n\n==See also==\n*[[The Shores of Faëry]]\n*[[The Happy Mariners]]\n*[[Eärendillinwë]]\n*[[Index:Poems by J.R.R.
