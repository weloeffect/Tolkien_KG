The special horror of the closed door before which the skeleton of Baldor was found was probably due to the fact that the door was the entrance to an evil temple hall to which Baldor had come, probably without opposition up to that point. But the door was shut in his face, and enemies that had followed him silently came up and broke his legs and left him to die in the darkness, unable to find any way out.|{{HM|RC}}, \"[[The Last Debate]]\"}}\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Men]]\n[[Category:Servants of Melkor]]\n[[Category:Servants of Saruman]]\n[[Category:Servants of Sauron]]"}}}
