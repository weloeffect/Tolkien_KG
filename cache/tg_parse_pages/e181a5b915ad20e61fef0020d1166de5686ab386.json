Their theft by [[Morgoth]] was the trigger for the following [[Battles of Beleriand|War of the Jewels]] narrated in the ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'' (\"''The History of the Silmarils''\").\n\n==Description==\nThe shells of the gems were crafted of the hard crystalline substance ''[[silima]]'', which [[Fëanor]] had devised, and they were named after it. In their hearts burned some of the [[Light of Valinor]] from the [[Two Trees of Valinor|Two Trees]]. Their exact nature and the manner of their making were known only to Fëanor, and none other succeeded in making gems of comparable greatness and beauty. Varda hallowed the Silmarils so that no mortal or evil hands could touch them without being burned and withered.<ref name=\"unrest\">{{S|7}}</ref> \n\nBut the Silmarils were tainted by arrogance and lust by anyone who desired them, starting with Morgoth, then Fëanor. As the [[Oath of Fëanor]] proclaimed, it resulted in evil ends, such as the [[Fall of the Noldor]], the [[Doom of Mandos]], [[Kinslaying (disambiguation)|Kinslayings]] and the destruction of [[Doriath]].\n\n==History==\nThe Silmarils were created by [[Fëanor]] in [[Valinor]] after the un[[chaining of Melkor]]. According to a legend, Fëanor conceived the idea of capturing the light of the trees from the [[hair of Galadriel]], which shone with gold and silver.<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}, p. 230</ref> Fëanor gave his heart to their making and could not duplicate them. \n\nFëanor wore the jewels at festivals and the [[Eldar]] admired them. Melkor coveted their light and soon, corrupted by his lies, Fëanor started to lock them away, and became greedy for them. After Fëanor was exiled to [[Formenos]], the Silmarils were stored in a chamber of iron.<ref name=\"unrest\" />\n\nTogether with [[Ungoliant]], [[Morgoth|Melkor]] destroyed the Two Trees. The Silmarils now contained all that remained of the light of the Trees. The [[Valar]] entreated Fëanor to give up the Silmarils so they could restore the Trees, but he refused.\n\n===Theft by Morgoth===\n[[File:Felix Sotomayor - Throne of Morgoth.jpg|thumb|left|''Throne of Morgoth'' by [[Felix Sotomayor]]]]\nThen news arrived that Melkor had killed Fëanor's father [[Finwë]], the [[King of the Noldor]], and stolen all the gems. He and Ungoliant fled to the northlands of [[Middle-earth]], where his ancient [[Utumno|fortresses]] were, but they quarrelled as the spider had devoured all the gems, and wanted also the Silmarils, something that Melkor, now named ''[[Morgoth]]'' by Fëanor, would not allow, even though their holy light burnt his hands and ceaselessly tormented him. The Silmarils were set on his [[Iron Crown]].\n\nFëanor was furious at Morgoth and at the Valar, who he believed desired to take the gems for their own purposes. Then he and his [[Sons of Fëanor|Sons]] swore a terrible [[Oath of Fëanor|Oath]]: that they would not rest until the Silmarils were recovered, slaying anyone who stood in their way. Fëanor led the Noldor back to Middle-earth and a centenary war began against Morgoth in [[Beleriand]], called the [[Battles of Beleriand|War of the Jewels]]. But their battles led to no end of grief for the Elves and eventually for the [[Men]] of Middle-earth.\n\nThe [[Sindar]]in King [[Thingol]] learned of the Silmarils from the Noldor. Wishing to dispose of [[Beren]], he gave him the apparently impossible task to [[Quest for the Silmaril|fetch one]] for the hand of his daughter, [[Lúthien]]. Impelled by his love for her, Beren reached [[Angband]] through great peril and loss and, with the aid of Lúthien, recovered one from Morgoth's crown, only for the gem to be swallowed by the [[Werewolves|werewolf]] [[Carcharoth]]. The hallowed light tormented the evil Carcharoth, until he was [[Hunting of the Wolf|slain]] in [[Forest of Neldoreth|Neldoreth]]. The Silmaril thus was delivered to Thingol, fulfilling Beren's Quest.<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Jef Murray - Earendil.jpg|thumb|right|''Earendil'' by [[Jef Murray]]]]\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Maedhros Casts Himself into a Chasm.jpg|thumb|''Maedhros Casts Himself into a Chasm'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\n[[Image:Ted Nasmith - Maglor Casts a Silmaril into the Sea.jpg|thumb|''Maglor Casts a Silmaril into the Sea'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nInstead of giving it to the [[Sons of Fëanor]], Thingol had the [[Dwarves of Nogrod]] store the gem inside the dwarven pendant [[Nauglamír]]. However, the dwarves also coveted the jewel and killed Thingol. Doriath was [[battle in the Thousand Caves|ruined]] by the Dwarves. The Nauglamír was recovered from the dwarves by Beren at the [[Battle of Sarn Athrad]], and he gave it to Lúthien, who wore it until her second death, becoming the fairest vision east of the Sea. It was said that their second death came early, because their combined beauty was too bright for mortal lands.\n\n===Doom of the Noldor===\nAfter Lúthien's death, a Lord of the [[Laiquendi]] brought the Nauglamír back to [[Doriath]], and her son [[Dior]] wore it. News of the Silmaril came to the sons of Fëanor, who, stirred by their Oath, came to Doriath and resolved to [[Second Kinslaying|battle]], during which three of the brothers were killed, and [[Menegroth]] was ruined. However, the Nauglamír was rescued by [[Elwing]] and Sindarin survivors who fled to the [[Havens of Sirion]].<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref> \n\nYears passed and the Silmaril came to the hands of Elwing's husband, [[Eärendil]], the lord of the Havens of Sirion. His people considered the Silmaril to be a blessing for their houses and ships. But the remaining sons of Fëanor still pursued the Silmaril, and when they learned where Elwing had escaped to, they sent word demanding the jewel while Eärendil was away on one of his voyages. But the people of Sirion refused to surrender the Silmaril, considering it a rightful prize of Beren and Lúthien. Therefore the sons of Fëanor resolved to make [[Third Kinslaying|another assault]], but Elwing escaped with the Silmaril once again, casting herself into the sea and reaching Eärendil with the help of [[Ulmo]]. The light of the Silmaril guided Eärendil through the [[Shadowy Seas]] and he found his way to Valinor. The Valar then set this Silmaril as a [[Star of Eärendil|star]] in the sky, bound on Eärendil's brow as he sailed through the sky in his [[Vingilot|hallowed ship]].<ref name=\"war\">{{S|Earendil}}</ref>\n\nThe other two Silmarils had remained in Morgoth's hands, until they were taken from him at the end of the [[War of Wrath]] and given to [[Eönwë]] for safekeeping. However, soon afterwards, they were stolen by Fëanor's two surviving sons, [[Maedhros]] and [[Maglor]]. Because of the crimes they had committed in order to reclaim the jewels, they were now unworthy of them, and the Silmarils burned their hands in refusal of their rights of possession. In agony, Maedhros threw himself and his Silmaril into a fiery pit, and Maglor threw his into the sea.<ref name=\"war\" /> \n\nThus the Silmarils remain in all three elements of Arda - in the sky, soil and water - fulfilling the prophecy made by [[Mandos]] shortly after the making of the gems.<ref name=\"unrest\" />\n\nIt is said that Fëanor will return for the [[Dagor Dagorath]]. Following Melkor's final return and ultimate defeat, the World [[Arda Healed|will be changed]] and the Silmarils recovered. Fëanor will break his jewels and with their fire [[Yavanna]] will revive the [[Two Trees of Valinor|Two Trees]]. The [[Pelóri|Pelóri Mountains]] will be flattened and the light of the Two Trees will fill Arda again in a new age of Eternal Bliss.<ref>{{WJ|Last}}, p. 247</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word is said to contain ''[[silima]]'', the substance they were made from, as well as an element from brightness, ''ril''.<ref name=\"elements\">{{S|Elements}}, entry ''sil-''</ref>\n\nThey mean \"radiance of pure light\".<ref>{{L|148}}, p. 148</ref> It might contain the ending ''rillë'' (\"brilliance\").<ref>{{VT|46a}}, p. 11</ref>\n\nThe proper [[Quenya]] plural form is ''Silmarilli'', \"Silmarils\" being an Anglicised name.\n\n==Other names==\nIn linguistic notes from late 1969 Tolkien said the Silmarils were sometimes called the '''''Mírenel,''''' or 'jewel triad' (meaning literally 'three gems')''.''<ref>{{PE|23}}, pp. 142</ref>\n\nAnother early Quenya name for a Silmaril was '''''Ilumírë'''''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry \"IL\"</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Etymologies]]'' appears the [[Noldorin]] name '''''Silevril''''' as the cognate for [[Quenya]] ''Silmaril''.<ref name=\"Ety\">{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries \"[[RIL]]\", \"[[SIL]]\"</ref> [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] appears to have retained the Noldorin form in [[Sindarin]], since the name ''Pennas Silevril'' (apparently the Sindarin translation of Quenya ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'')<ref>[[Helge Fauskanger]], [http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/sindarin.htm Sindarin, the Noble Tongue: Sindarin Plural Patterns] at [[Ardalambion]] (accessed 10 July 2011)</ref> is used in later manuscripts.<ref>{{MR|P3II1}}, p. 200</ref>\n\nOther Noldorin names from ''The Etymologies'' are ''Golodhvir'' meaning \"Noldo-jewel(s)\" (cf. ''[[Golodh]]'' meaning \"Noldo\") and ''Mirion'' pl. ''Miruin'' meaning \"Great jewel/s\".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry \"[[MIR]]\"</ref>\n\nIn [[Aelfwine]]'s [[Old English]] translations, the name ''Silmaril'' is rendered phonetically as ''Sigelmaerels''. As noted by [[Christopher Tolkien]] it is composed of OE ''sigel'' (\"sun, jewel\") ''maerels'' (\"rope\"), actually referring to the Nauglamir.<ref>{{SM|QA1}}, p. 209</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n===The Book of Lost Tales===\nThe Silmarils appear since the earliest version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. Although they do not have the same importance as in later versions, their making is described there in more detail:\n\n{{blockquote|Then arose Fëanor of the [[Noldoli]] and fared to the [[Solosimpi]] and begged a great pearl, and he got moreover an urn full of the most luminous phosphor-light gathered of foam in dark places, and with these he came home, and he took all the other gems and did gather their glint by the light of white lamps and silver candles, and he took the sheen of pearls and the faint half-colours of opals, and he [?bathed] them in phosphorescence and the radiant dew of [[Silpion]], and but a single tiny drop of the light of [[Laurelin]] did he let fall therein, and giving all those magic lights a body to dwell in of such perfect glass as he alone could make nor even Aulë compass, so great was the slender dexterity of the fingers of Fëanor, he made a jewel — and it shone of its own [?wizardous] radiance in the uttermost dark; and he set it therein and sat a very long while and gazed at its beauty.}}\n\nFëanor made two more jewels, and called them '''''Silmarilli''''', or '''''Silubrilthin''''' in the [[Gnomish|language of the Noldoli]]. Of all the many jewels made by the Noldoli, and of all the pearls of the Solosimpi, the jewels of Fëanor were held as the most beautiful.<ref name=lt1-5>{{LT1|V}}, p. 128</ref> Their relation with pearls can be seen in their etymology: [[Qenya]] ''Silmaril'' came from ''Sil'' (\"[[Moon]]\") + ''[[marilla]]'' (\"pearl\"); while [[Gnomish]] ''Silubrilt'' came from ''Sil'' + ''[[brithla]]'' (\"pearl\").<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, entries \"Sil\", \"Silmarilli\"</ref> One can note that, while the jewels had been made by the Noldoli<ref name=lt1-5/>, the beginning (before the arrival of Melko) of clams with pearls (as opposed to many other animals) remains a mystery.<ref>{{LT1|IV}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Noldoli were banished from [[Kôr]] to [[Sirnúmen]], the Silmarils were put in an ivory casket, and guarded among the many jewels. Later [[Melko]] stole all the treasures of the Noldoli, including the Silmarils.<ref>{{LT1|VI}}, pp. 114-145</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Quest for the Silmaril]]\n*[[Nauglamír]]\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Heirlooms]]\n[[Category:Rings and jewels]]\n[[de:Silmaril]]\n[[fr:encyclo/artefacts/bijoux/silmarils]]\n[[fi:Silmarilit]]"}}}
