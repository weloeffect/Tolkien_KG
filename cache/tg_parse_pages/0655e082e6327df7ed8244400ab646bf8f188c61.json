Tolkien]] around [[1931]].<ref name=collectedpoems>{{CP|126}}, pp. 881-4</ref>\n\n==Poem excerpt==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\n:Twixt Earth and Heaven towers tall\n:are mounted above wall on wall,\n:their windy peaks are fierce and free,\n:their feet are founded in the sea;\n:and to those towers of light and snow\n:faint comes the murmur far below\n:of the green waves and the white seas\n:and little tempests like a breeze.<ref name=collectedpoems/></poem>\n\n==Background==\nAround [[1931]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote a melancholic<ref name=\"Holmes\"/> poem on \"a fair copy typescript\" that he initially titled '''''The Last of the Gods''''' before changing the name to ''The Last of the Old Gods''.<ref name=collectedpoems/> After the end of line 36, Tolkien wrote \"end?\" in addition to briefly pondering whether to delete \"the final two stanzas\" before deciding to possibly only delete lines 73 to the end.<ref name=collectedpoems/> In the third section of a list of poems headed \"[[Kortirion among the Trees]]\" that may have began as a revision of a [[1926]]/[[1927|27]] list labeled \"[[Contents]]\", Tolkien added ''The Last of the Old Gods'' as '''''Last of the [Old] Gods'''''.<ref name=\"list\">{{CP|A3}}, p. 1385 (list \"G\")</ref> After making the \"[[Kortirion among the Trees]]\" list, Tolkien assigned \"a rough programme\" to each section, with the third one (the one ''The Last of the Old Gods'' was in) being labeled as \"The Silmarillion\".<ref>{{CP|A3}}, p. 1386 (list \"G\")</ref> In the third section of another, subsequent, list, Tolkien also included ''The Last of the Old Gods'' among poems relating to the [[legendarium]].<ref>{{CP|A3}}, p. 1388 (list \"H\")</ref>\n\nIn [[September]] of [[2024]], the poem was published for the first time as entry 126 in ''[[The Collected Poems of J.R.R. Tolkien]]''.<ref name=collectedpoems/> In their commentary, [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] suggest that while ''The Last of the Old Gods'' \"does not have any overt connection with Tolkien’s mythology\", Tolkien did include ''The Last of the Old Gods'' in a list alongside poems that \"are explicitly related to the 'Silmarillion' mythology\".<ref name=collectedpoems/> They note further that \"it is possible to find…elements in common\", comparing \"the notion of 'a timeless time when musics grew\" to \"the ''[[Ainulindalë]]''…in 'The Silmarillion'\" and \"the titular old god…watching for 'a light upon the margins…of this deep world beneath the sun'\" to \"the [[Valar]]\" waiting \"for the coming of [[Elves]] and [[Men]]\".<ref name=collectedpoems/> Despite this, they point out that:<ref name=collectedpoems/>{{Blockquote|it is also easy to read this poem as a comment on the state of the world in the early 1930s, when trouble was again stirring on the Continent and fears of another war loomed. Most of the work is told from the point of view of the 'old god', who sees 'dead cold ruin' and the (metaphorical) crumbling of dykes which have held back 'the outer seas'; but towards its end the emphasis shifts to Men, who no longer look to the old gods, who 'shrug and turn', yet retain a spark of defiance. Are they to be considered 'new gods' in contrast to the 'old'? The poet expresses a hope that beacons and ramparts can be erected again against the dark, though it is a weak, indeed fatalist view: a wall or dyke will only delay 'what must be' – the 'end of things'.<ref name=collectedpoems/>}} Hammond and Scull note that the slightly later [[Latin]] poem, ''[[Quare Fremunt Omnes Gentes]]'', in [[1932]]<ref>{{CP|135}}, p. 1035</ref> may have \"a similar outlook\"<ref name=collectedpoems/> to ''The Last of the Old Gods''.<ref name=collectedpoems/> In a review of ''[[The Collected Poems of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'' in the ''Journal of Tolkien Research'', John R. Holmes notes that ''The Last of the Old Gods'' \"presents a melancholy ''Götterdämmerung''\" like what Tolkien called the \"long defeat\".<ref name=\"Holmes\"/> Holmes suggests that this concept was not unique to \"the northern myths\", but that the theme was explored in Swinburne's \"Hymn to Proserpine\" in 1866 that deals with \"the classical Roman gods\".<ref name=\"Holmes\"/> In addition to suggesting that ''The Last of the Old Gods'' \"is generalized enough…to apply to the…receding of the elves in Tolkien’s [[Middle-earth]]\", Holmes notes that, \"as Scull and Hammond point out, however, the twilight mood also fits Tolkien's World War I generation in 1931\".<ref name=\"Holmes\"/> On [[29 September]] of [[2025]], Sean Johnson noted on \"The Daily Poem Podcast\" that ''The Last of the Old Gods'' shows that many of the eucatastrophe themes of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' were \"already well-formed\" long before.<ref>{{webcite |author= Sean Johnson|articleurl= https://dailypoempod.substack.com/p/j-r-r-tolkiens-the-last-of-the-old|articlename= J.R.R.
