The song name is taken from [[Barad-dûr|Lugbúrz]], meaning \"''dark tower''\" in the [[Black Speech]], referring to [[Barad-dûr]]. The lyrics directly quote the [[Cold be hand and heart and bone,|incantation]] chanted by a [[Barrow-wights|Barrow-wight]] who had trapped [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] in the [[Fog on the Barrow-downs]] chapter of [[The Fellowship of the Ring]].\n\n==Lyrics==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nCold be hand and heart and bone, \nand cold be sleep under stone: \nnever more to wake on stony bed, \nnever, till the sun fails and the moon is dead. \n\nIn the black wind the stars shall die, \nand still on gold here let them lie, \ntill the dark lord lifts his hand \nover dead sea and withered land \n\nWhen the winter first begins to bite \nand stones crack in the frosty night, \nwhen pools are black and trees are bare, \nit is evil in the wild to fare. \n\nTo lay down my will upon the Land, Lugburz \n\nNo sound disturbs this place of blackened souls \nThis winter walls of stone and ice behold thy might \nAgain I'm kneeling down to hear these strange tunes of war \nNight, oh beloved night, your wisdom floats into my mind \nand forms my thoughts of Middle-Earth \nto build up a new mighty empire.\n</poem>\n{{title}}\n[[Category:Songs by Summoning]]"}}}
