Placed in the middle of the collection as the ninth poem, it seems to not fit in with the categories of the other poems: fairy-like, whimsical, bestiary, or emotional, but rather serves as a divider separating the two halves of the collection.<ref>{{AB|Intro}}</ref>\n\n==First stanza==\n<poem>\nThe Shadows where the Mewlips dwell\n:Are dark and wet as ink,\nAnd slow and softly rings their bell,\n:As in the slime you sink.<ref name=\"Mewlips\">{{AB|Mewlips}}</ref>\n</poem>\n\n==List of terms==\nBelow is a list of terms that are used within the poem.\n\n*'''Shadows''' - The deep, dark, and cold wet cellars where the Mewlips lived. It had a door with a bell and there was only one lit sickly candle.<ref name=\"Mewlips\" />\n*'''[[Mewlips]]''' - A fictitious race of beings that dwelled in some cellars at the end of a long road, where they were said to count gold. They fed on the protagonist, keeping their bones for their collection.<ref name=\"Mewlips\" /> They were possibly based on [[Orcs]].<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 260, entry \"Mewlips, The\"</ref>\n*'''You''' - The term referring to the protagonist who dares to travel the long road to knock on the Mewlips's door, being devoured by the creatures as a result. Their bones are kept by the Mewlips in a sack.<ref name=\"Mewlips\" />\n*'''Gargoyles''' - An unknown number of grinning statues above the door to the cellars of the Mewlips.<ref name=\"Mewlips\" />\n*'''[[Gorcrows]]''' - A likely fictitious type of [[Crows|crow]] that croaks in their sleep, presumably dwelling in or near the same place as the Mewlips.<ref name=\"Mewlips\" /> ''Gorcrow'' (\"gore crow\") is an [[Old English]] name for [[Wikipedia:Carrion Crow|carrion crow]].<ref>Patrick J. Cassidy, ed. (1913), ''Webster Dictionary''</ref>\n*'''[[Merlock Mountains]]''' - A likely fictitious name for some [[Misty Mountains|mountains]] on the long, weary, and lonely road to the Mewlips' cellars.<ref name=\"Mewlips\" /> [[Tolkien fandom|Fans]] have speculated that the name ''Merlock'' was inspired by the name ''Morlock'' appearing in an earlier version, ''Knocking at the Door''.<ref>{{webcite|author='geordie'|articleurl=http://www.lotrplaza.com/showthread.php?25289-Middle-earth-Is-Orbiting-Saturn|articlename=Middle-earth Is Orbiting Saturn (post #3)|dated=26 December 2012|website=Plaza|accessed=15 February 2013}}</ref>\n*'''Spider-shadows''' - A likely fictitious name for [[Mirkwood]] on the road to the Mewlips' cellars.<ref name=\"Mewlips\" />\n*'''[[Tode]]''' - A likely fictitious name for some [[Long Marshes|marshes]] on the road to the Mewlips' cellars.<ref name=\"Mewlips\" /> ''[[Wiktionary:tode#Middle English|Tode]]'' is the [[Middle English]] spelling of \"[[Frog|toad]]\"; it was also a word with evil connotations, as toads were considered to be demonic creatures according to Wiktionary (cf. abovementioned link). Furthermore, ''[[Wiktionary:Tode#German|Tode]]'' is also the [[Germanic|German]] word for \"death\".\n*'''Wood of hanging trees''' - A fictitious name for a forest on the road to the Mewlips' cellars.<ref name=\"Mewlips\" />\n*'''Gallows-weed''' - A likely fictitious type of hanging weed, found in the wood of hanging trees.<ref name=\"Mewlips\" /> It was only ever known by this name, and its physical description is never talked about nor described. Few people who ever entered these marshes, and thus even saw these gallows-weeds, ever returned, thus there was no description of them.\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n\"The Mewlips\" was a rewrite of an earlier [[Index:Poems by J.R.R. Tolkien|poem]] that Tolkien wrote, titled '''Knocking at the Door''', which was possibly written in [[1927]]. Subtitled '''Lines Induced by Sensation When Waiting for an Answer at the Door of an Exalted Academic Person''', the poem was published under the pseudonym ''Oxymore'' in ''[[Oxford Magazine]]'', vol. 55, no. 13 ([[18 February]] [[1937]]), page 403. Tolkien later rewrote the poem and included it in ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'' in [[1962]].<ref name=\"guide\">{{CG|RG}}. p. 586</ref><ref name=\"oxymore\">{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.tolkienbooks.net/php/details.php?reference=13930|articlename=Oxford Magazine. February 1937|dated=|website=TB|accessed=16 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the plot notes that [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] made while writing the ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the [[Raft-elves|raftsmen]] told tales of rafts, men, and beasts disappearing in the [[Long Marshes]];<ref>{{HH|PNB}}, p. 362</ref> [[John D. Rateliff]] suggests that the more ominous line in the notes may indicate that Tolkien had some unpleasantness in mind had [[Thorin and Company]] gotten into the marshes - perhaps meeting the Mewlips.<ref>{{HH|PNB}}, (ii) ''Visiting the Mewlips'', p. 370</ref> If this is the case, the idea of these plot notes may possibly have been in Tolkien's mind when he eventually wrote the poem. If this is indeed the case, then the \"you\" in the poem may possibly be referring to one of the raftsmen.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''\n:The ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'' took inspiration from the poem and came up with their own interpretations of Mewlips and Gorcrows on various supplements. Mewlips are described and given statistics as [[Undead]] beings living within swamps and marshes. The race was conceived as having been created by [[Morgoth]] during the [[Elder Days]].<ref>{{ICE|8108}}</ref><ref>{{ICE|8007}}</ref> Gorcrows are said to have 4 ft. wingspan and to be smaller cousins of the ''[[crebain]]'',<ref>{{ICE|2012}}</ref> being attracted to shiny things.<ref group=\"note\">A common character trait of crows, [[wikipedia:Common Raven|ravens]], [[wikipedia:European Magpie|magpies]] and [[wikipedia:Jackdaw|jackdaws]], for example.</ref><ref>{{ICE|8014}}, p. 6</ref> Northern Gorcrows lived in [[Northern Waste|Forodwaith]], being described as larger versions of common Gorcrows. The [[Lossoth]] are said to have regarded northern Gorcrows as birds of ill-omen.<ref>{{ICE|2025}}</ref>\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:''Gore-crows'' are a type of crebain native to the [[Lone-lands]].
