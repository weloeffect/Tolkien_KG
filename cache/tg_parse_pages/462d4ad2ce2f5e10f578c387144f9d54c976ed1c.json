He was one of the close friends of [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] who knew that he had the [[The One Ring|Ring]] and helped him with his mission to leave the Shire. \n==History==\n===Ancestry===\nFatty was a descendant of [[Hildibrand Took]] ({{TA|2849}} - {{TA|2934}}), one of the many sons of the [[Gerontius Took|Old Took]].<ref name=took>{{App|Took}}</ref> He was the son of [[Odovacar Bolger]] and [[Rosamunda Took]]. Fatty was born in {{TA|2980}} and his family was from [[Budgeford]] in [[Bridgefields]] of the [[Eastfarthing]]. He also had a younger sister, [[Estella Brandybuck|Estella Bolger]] (b. {{TA|2985}}), who would eventually marry [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]]. \n\nFredegar was a good friend of [[Frodo Baggins]]. In {{TA|3001}} he was a guest at [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]].<ref name=took/>\n\n===Conspiracy===\nFatty was one of the [[Conspirators]], the friends of Frodo who knew that he was in an important mission to leave the Shire, and they assisted him without his knowledge. Fatty, along with [[Folco Boffin]] and Frodo's close circle, in [[September]] {{TA|3018}} helped him pack and send his things to [[Crickhollow]], and stayed to celebrate his last [[22 September|birthday]] before his departure from [[Hobbiton]]; Fatty and Merry left [[23 September|the next morning]] for the house that Frodo had bought, in order to prepare it to be ready and habitable for his arrival.<ref>{{FR|Three}}</ref> \n\nFrodo eventually came to his house, along with [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]]. It was there when the conspirators revealed themselves to Frodo, and expressed their will to follow him in his mission. Fatty however was a typical hobbit who had never left the Shire and was unwilling to do so, but would play his role; he stayed behind to keep up the pretence that Frodo was there, by wearing his clothes and keep the house occupied, and deal with any \"inquisitive folk\". \n\nAfter hearing that Frodo was pursued by the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]], Fatty was given the option to flee with the others into the [[Old Forest]], but that didn't seem any more inviting to him despite Merry's attempts to persuade him that the Riders were far more terrifying than the stories about the Old Forest. Fredegar opted to remain behind as a decoy for the Nazgûl and as a messenger for [[Gandalf]] in case he showed up.<ref>{{FR|I5}}</ref>\n[[File:Christina Wald - Fatty Bolger.jpg|thumb|left|Christina Wald - ''Fatty Bolger'']]\nThe Ringwraiths did eventually come in the night of [[30 September]] to Crickhollow for Frodo and [[the One Ring|the Ring]]. But Fatty, though frightened nearly witless, escaped to raise the alarm of [[Buckland]], causing the [[Brandybucks]] to sound the [[Horn-call of Buckland]]. This caused the Nazgûl to flee, but they had learned that the Ring was gone.<ref>{{FR|I11}}</ref>\n\n===Resistance===\nDuring [[Saruman]]'s rule of [[the Shire]], Fatty led a group of partisans fighting against the [[Ruffians]] in the [[Brockenbores]] around the hills of [[Scary]] before eventually being captured. He was imprisoned in the [[Lockholes]] and starved, (and could no longer be called \"Fatty\") but was rescued after the victory of the [[Battle of Bywater]].<ref name=\"Havens\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name contains ''ferdi'' \"peace\" and ''gar'' \"spear\".<ref>[[An Introduction to Elvish]], \"Giving of Names\"</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn early versions of the text (cf. ''[[The Return of the Shadow]]''), his name was '''Hamilcar Bolger''' and was rescued by [[Gandalf]] from [[Black Riders]] before reaching [[Rivendell]], narrating to the protagonists Gandalf's adventures. His larger role was later abandoned.<ref name=rc>{{HM|RC}}, p. xxiii</ref>\n\nHis role survives as a minor anomaly in the published ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' - before the four Hobbits go into the [[Old Forest]], they have ''six'' ponies prepared (Fatty was originally supposed to go with them). The number was corrected to ''five'' in the [[The Lord of the Rings (50th Anniversary Edition)|50th Anniversary Edition]].<ref>{{HM|FR}}, \"Note\", p. xvii</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"201px\" heights=\"\nFile:Fatty at Bilbo's party.jpg|Fatty in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game - Fredegar Bolger, Fatty.jpg|Fredegar in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Fredegar Bolger.jpg|Fredegar in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''px\">\nFile:Fatty at Bilbo's party.jpg|Fatty in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game - Fredegar Bolger, Fatty.jpg|Fredegar in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Fredegar Bolger.jpg|Fredegar in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n\n'''1979: ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1979 radio series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' by The Mind's Eye'''\n:Fatty appears in much the same role as in the book.
