He considers their different effects on both readers and literary critics, and brings to light the deep connections between these two subjects, as well as between them and Tolkien's ultimate concern, 'Death and the desire for deathlessness.' Also illuminated, in contrast, is magic, as epitomised by the One Ring. Finally, he argues that the hobbits are exemplars of how to live in relation to enchantment: neither pursuing, nor avoiding, but honouring it. }}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.walking-tree.org/books/deep_roots.php Official product page]\n\n{{Cormarë}}\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]\n[[fi:Deep Roots in a Time of Frost]]"}}}
