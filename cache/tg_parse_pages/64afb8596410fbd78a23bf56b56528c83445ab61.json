Gaining followers, he had subjugated the Chey territories by {{SA|2000}}. Unbelievers among the Chey tribes were purged.<ref name=\"nazgul\">{{ICE|8003}}, pp. 94-95</ref>\n\nThe First Chey Expansion ({{SA|2155}}-{{SA|2693|n}}) saw the Fire King expanding his empire into to the lands of Dalpygis, Khargagis Ahar, Heb Aaraan, and Orgothraath. The Second Chey Expansion  ({{SA|2899}}-{{SA|3261|n}}) then expanded into Vaag, Acaana, and western Gaathgykarkan. With the help of the [[Variags]] of [[Ninth of the Nazgûl|Ûvatha]], Ren also conquered the the rest of Kargagis Ahar and Rycolis.<ref name=\"nazgul\"/>\n\nAfter the [[War of the Last Alliance]], the empire waned and split back into tribes. The Chey often faced Variag and Nûriag oppression. After Ren returned to Middle-earth in {{TA|1050}}, he returned to his volcano, which he expanded into an underground citadel. From there, he once again started subjugating the tribes. He had achieved this by {{TA|1264}}. The two periods during which Ren reigned in Chey Sart, from {{TA|1264}} to {{TA|1640|n}} and from {{TA|2063}} to {{TA|2941|n}} were times of prosperity and expansion for the Chey.<ref name=\"nazgul\"/>\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Middle-earth Role Playing locations]]"}}}
