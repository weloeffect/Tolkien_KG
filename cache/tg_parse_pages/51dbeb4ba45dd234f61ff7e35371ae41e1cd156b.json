Vána robed Nessa with her flowers for the wedding.<ref>{{MR|P2}}</ref>\n\nVána dwelt in gardens filled with golden flowers and often came to the forests of Oromë. In the days of the [[Two Trees]] of [[Valinor]], the [[Maia]] maiden, [[Arien]], \"tended to the golden flowers of the gardens of Vána by watering them with the bright dews from [[Laurelin]]\".<ref>{{S|11}}</ref> [[Melian]] was another Maia who initially served Vána and [[Estë]] before she departed to [[Middle-earth]].<ref>{{S|IIc}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Vána'' is [[Quenya]] for \"beautiful\", from [[root]] [[BAN]], related to unmarred beauty.<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 150</ref> She was also called the '''Ever-young'''.<ref name=Valar/>\n\n== Other names ==\nIn ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' she is also referred to in full as '''Vána Tuivána'''.<ref>{{LT1|III}}</ref>{{rp|84}}\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| | | | | |,|-|-|-|.| | | |,|-|-|-|.| | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| AUL |~| YAV | | VAN |~| ORO | | NES |~| TUL | |AUL=[[Aulë]]|YAV=[[Yavanna]]|VAN='''VÁNA'''|ORO=[[Oromë]]|NES=[[Nessa]]|TUL=[[Tulkas]]}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n===The Book of Lost Tales===\nIn the earliest form of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', she and [[Oromë]] had a daughter, [[Nielíqui]].<ref>{{LT1|Index}}, entry \"Nielíqui\"</ref> Whilst in the origins of the story of the [[Two Trees]], Vána played a formative role in the growth of [[Laurelin]]:\n{{blockquote|Then was the pit covered with rich earths that [[Palúrien]] devised, and Vána came who loveth life and sunlight and at whose song the flowers arise and open, and the murmur of her maidens round her was like to the merry noise of the folk that stir abroad for the first time on a bright morning. There sang she the song of spring upon the mound, and danced about it, and watered it with great streams of that golden light that [[Ulmo]] had brought from the spilled lakes--yet was ''[[Kulullin]]'' almost o'erflowing at the end.<ref>{{LT1|III}}, p. 71</ref>}}\n\nLater, when the power of Palúrien had failed to heal the wounds of the [[Two Trees]], Vána's love for [[Laurelin]] was so great that it caused the tree's remaining life to come forth one last time as a fruit of gold from which the [[Valar]] later fashioned the [[Sun]]. Vána's maiden, [[Arien|Urwen]], would steer the Sun's vessel across the sky. Vána, who repented of speaking against the harvest of Laurelin's last fruit, cut her hair short to weave the tresses as the sails for the Sun-ship. Among other names, the Sun was called \"the Lamp of Vána\" in memory of her tears and the hair she offered.<ref>{{LT1|VIII}}, p. 186</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Darkening of Valinor]] and the [[Exile of the Noldor|flight of the Noldoli]] to the [[Great Lands]], most of the [[Valar]] were glad to have their ancient peace back, wishing neither the rumours of [[Melko]] and his violence nor the murmur of the restless [[Noldoli]] to disturb them again. For such reasons, they sought the concealment and protection of their land [[Aman]]. It was said that particularly Vána and [[Nessa]] were of one mind in this matter, in accordance with most of the other Valar.<ref>{{LT1|IX}}, pp. 208-209</ref>\n\n===Later versions===\nAs Tolkien's works evolved, Vána's role was reduced, so in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' she does not interfere in the tale of the Sun and Moon, Nienna's tears being what cleansed the trees and Yavanna's songs what brought forth the final bloom of Telperion and fruit of Laurelin.\n\n{{References}}\n{{Ainur}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vana}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Qenya names]]\n[[Category:Quenya names]]\n[[Category:Valar]]\n\n[[de:Vána]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/ainur/valar/vana]]\n[[fi:Vána]]"}}}
