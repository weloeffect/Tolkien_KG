He made his screen debut in 1973, and gained some fame as unemployed [[wikipedia:Scouser|Scouser]] [[wikipedia:Yosser Hughes|Yosser Hughes]] in ''[[wikipedia:The Black Stuff|The Black Stuff]]'' and its sequel, ''Boys from the Black Stuff''. Before that, he had made minor appearances in [[BBC]] series, including ''[[wikipedia:I, Claudius (TV series)|I, Claudius]]'' (which boasts many great actors, including [[Brian Blessed]], [[Christopher Guard]], [[Norman Shelley]], [[John Hurt]], [[John Rhys-Davies]] and [[Derek Jacobi]] in the title role).\n\nA steady career with few peaks followed. He had a minor role in ''[[wikipedia:Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'' and a remarkable bigger one as [[wikipedia:Edward Smith|Captain Smith]] in ''[[wikipedia:Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' in 1997.\n\nHill's appearance in both the ''Titanic'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' make him the only actor to have appeared in more than one of the three films awarded 11 Oscars (the third being ''Ben Hur'') and one of only three actors to have starred in more than one film grossing more than $1 billion USD (another one being [[Orlando Bloom]] who also starred in ''The Return of the King'', as well as ''Pirates of the Caribbean''). Both movies (and ''Gandhi'') have won Best Picture.\n\nThe irony that he died in both led to some jokes about having to kill Bernard Hill in order to clear a billion.\n\nHis birthday coincides with the premiere of ''The Return of the King''.\n\n==Roles==\n* [[2003]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' - [[Théoden]]\n* [[2002]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' - Théoden\n\n==Quotes==\n{{quote|The ensemble qualities of this award go way beyond the cast I think. I think everyone here realizes that we sit atop a kind of pyramid of talent, we actors. Because we can't do what we do without the whole structure beneath us, and I think we're all very aware of that, and very appreciative of the producers, the writers, the directors, and the make-up people, and the people who arrange the trailers in a circle and keep them warm for us in the morning, and make sure that we've got coffee and tea and things that keep us going during the day, and all that kind of stuff.|Bernard Hill, acceptance speech for the [[22 February|SAG award for ensemble cast]].}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{WP|Bernard Hill}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hill, Bernard}}\n[[Category:Actors and actresses]]\n[[Category:British people]]\n[[Category:People by name]]\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings (film series) cast]]\n\n[[de:Bernard Hill]]\n[[fi:Bernard Hill]]"}}}
