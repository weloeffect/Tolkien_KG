He initially acted as one of the corrupted [[Wizards|Wizard]] [[Saruman]]'s most trusted agents, before being compelled into the service of the [[Nazgûl]] as an informant.\n\n== History ==\nHailing from Dunland, the squint-eyed southerner was banished by his fellow [[Dunlendings|hillmen]] due to a rumor that he had Orc-blood coursing through his veins (implying he may have been one of the [[Half-orcs]] or [[Goblin-men]]).<ref name=\"UT10\">{{UT|10}}, \"Concerning Gandalf, Saruman, and the Shire\"</ref>\n\nHaving entered the employ of the Wizard Saruman, the southerner was at one point stationed on the borders of [[the Shire]] to negotiate the purchase of \"[[pipe-weed|leaf]]\" and other supplies which were stored in [[Isengard]] in preparation for the [[War of the Ring|war]]. The squint-eyed southerner had been instructed by his master to infiltrate the Shire and learn of any [[Hobbits]] who had departed recently in hopes of finding the [[Ring-bearer]]. The southerner was well supplied with maps, lists of names, and notes concerning the Shire.\n\nIn September of {{TA|3018}}, the Dunlending was traveling back to the Shire when the black-robed [[Nazgûl]] came upon him at the [[Tharbad]] crossing. When questioned, the southerner told the [[Witch-king]] everything, betraying the White Wizard; this proved Saruman was withholding information from his own master, [[Sauron]]. The Lord of [[Minas Morgul|Morgul]] was made aware of the name [[Baggins Family|Baggins]] and [[Hobbiton]] was singled out for immediate visit and inquiry.\n\nThe Witch-king put the [[Shadow]] of Fear on the southerner and sent him to [[Bree]] as a spy, warning him he now answered to the [[Eye of Sauron|Red Eye]] and not the [[White Hand]]. The Dunlending met up with [[Bill Ferny]] and at the [[Prancing Pony]] on [[September 29]]th, the two of them saw [[Frodo Baggins]] vanish into thin air. After reporting the information to the Nazgûl, the Nine Black Riders came to attack that night.<ref name=\"UT10\"/>\n\nAragorn kept the Hobbits safe through the night. The next morning, the squint-eyed southerner was spotted inside Bill Ferny's house when the company set out to [[Weathertop]].<ref name=\"FRI11\">{{FR|I11}}</ref>\n\nNothing else is recorded of the squint-eyed southerner. However in {{TA|3019|n}}, a large number of [[Ruffians]] occupied the Shire and oppressed the Hobbits.<ref>{{HM|RK}}, \"[[The Scouring of the Shire]]\"</ref> It is possible the southerner was among them as many of Saruman's agents there resembled him. The Men were driven out of the Shire in the [[Battle of Bywater]] on November 3.\n\n== Description ==\n{{quote|Just what my father meant to convey by the 'squint-eyed Southerner' at Bree I'm not sure. I don't think that he can possibly have meant that the man had 'slit-eyes' (goblin-like). He may have meant that he actually had a squint (optical disorder), but that seems unnecessarily particular. So the likeliest meaning, I think, is that the man didn't look straight, but obliquely, watchfully, sideways, suggesting craftiness and crookedness.|[[Christopher Tolkien]]<ref>\"The Squint-eyed Southerner\", ''[[Beyond Bree]]'', May [[1990]], p. 9</ref>}}\n\n== Portrayal in adaptations ==\n===Squint-eyed southerner in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game - Squint-eyed Southerner.jpg|The Squint-eyed Southerner in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]''\nFile:The Hobbit - The Desolation of Smaug - Squint.jpg|\"Squint\" in ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]''\n</gallery>\n\n'''2001-2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'':'''\n:A Decipher card identifies one of the Men at [[Bree]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' as the '''Squint-eyed Southerner'''.\n\n'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''\n: A character called '''The Southerner''' (loosely based on the novel character) attempts to talk Harley Bramble into joining with a gang of outlaws.
