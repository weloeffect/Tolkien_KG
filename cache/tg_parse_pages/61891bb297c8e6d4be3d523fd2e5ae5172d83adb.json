Those names were however also used in the [[Eastfarthing]] of [[the Shire]].<ref>{{App|D2}}</ref>\n==History==\nWhen the [[Hobbits]] were still a [[Wandering Days|wandering]] people, their calendaric unit was not a 'week' , but a 'month', governed more or less by the [[Moon]]. In their old calendar, the new year began after harvest. This can be seen in the name of the month [[Winterfilth]] meaning \"filling (of the year) before winter\". However, through contact with alien peoples (perhaps the [[Dúnedain of Arnor]]) they adopted the notion of weeks. \n\nThe Bree calendar is obviously a [[Hobbit]]ish localization of the [[King's Reckoning]] using [[Mannish]] month-names and several minor alterations to fit their customs. It is not known when the Calendar was introduced, but the [[Bree Reckoning]] begun at {{TA|1300}} (when Hobbits arrived in [[Bree]]).<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Andreas Moehn]]|articlename=The Reckoning of Time|articleurl=http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Time.html|website=Lalaith}}</ref>\n\nThe Bree Calendar followed that of the Shire in a couple of reforms, such as the shortening of the two medial months and the introduction of the [[Lithe]]days. The Bree Calendar also followed [[Thain]] [[Isengrim Took II|Isengrim II]]'s reform, which put the [[Mid-year's Day]] outside the reckoning of weekdays, so that every year started and ended at the same day of the week.\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Calendars]]\n[[Category:Hobbit Calendar]]\n[[fi:Briin kalenteri]]"}}}
