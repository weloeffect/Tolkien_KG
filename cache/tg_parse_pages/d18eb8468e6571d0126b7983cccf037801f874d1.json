This courtyard held the [[White Tree of Gondor]] and was guarded by the [[Guards of the Citadel]].  It was paved with white stones except around a fountain, where a sward of green lay.  The [[Dead Tree|dead White Tree]], seen by [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] as he hurried after [[Gandalf]], drooped over the fountain.<ref>{{RK|V1}}</ref>\n\n== Portrayal in adaptations ==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Court of the Fountain.jpg|thumb|left|The Court of the Fountain in ]'[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2015: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Court of the Fountain is represented in three different versions of the in-game [[Minas Tirith]]. Prior to the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] it houses the dead White Tree, modeled after Professor Tolkien's favorite tree in the Oxford Botanical Gardens. After King [[Elessar]] finds the new sapling, the old tree is removed and the sapling is planted down during a formal ceremony in which the player participates. During the royal wedding of Elessar and [[Arwen]] on [[Mid-year's Day|Midsummer Day]], the Court is the center of the festivities.\n\n{{references}}\n{{title}}\n[[Category:Minas Tirith]]\n[[Category:Squares]]\n[[de:Hof des Springbrunnens]]"}}}
