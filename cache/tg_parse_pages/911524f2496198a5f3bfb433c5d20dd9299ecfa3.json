([[Quenya|Q.]] ˈ''Day shall come again''ˈ) was the battle cry of [[Húrin]] during his last stand after the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad|Fifth Battle of Beleriand]], also known as the Battle of Unnumbered Tears.\n\n==History==\nBefore the battle, King [[Fingon]] had welcomed the armies of his brother [[Turgon]] with the cry: \"''[[Utúlie'n aurë!]] The day has come!''\" The hosts of [[Elves]] and [[Men]] had hope to defeat [[Morgoth]], but were defeated and forced to retreat leaving many dead. After his lord and companions had fallen, Húrin remained fighting, killing with his axe any Orc that approached him. With every strike he cried: \"'''''Aurë entuluva! Day shall come again!'''''\". He cried it seventy times before Orcs captured him alive, as Morgoth had ordered.<ref>{{S|20}}</ref>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://glaemscrafu.jrrvf.com/english/hurinquenya.html Text, audio and translation] at [[Glǽmscrafu]]\n*[http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2584794685.html Analysis] at [[Eldamo]]\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Battle cries]]\n[[Category:Quenya texts]]"}}}
