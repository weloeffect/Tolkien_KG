By custom, the bough had to be brought by a female, often a close relative of the captain.\n\nWhen [[Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion]], the son of [[Tar-Meneldur]], finished the great ship [[Palarran]] and purposed to go to sea, his father forbade any of his family to bring the bough to his ship.  [[Erendis]] performed this rite and on that day Aldarion fell in love with her.\n\nLater though, when Erendis had become the wife of Tar-Aldarion and estranged from him, she refused to bring the bough as a show of disagreement with her husband's frequent voyages towards [[Middle-earth]].  Therefore on the prow of Aldarion's later ship [[Hirilondë]] the image of an eagle stood, and not the Green Bough of Return.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Númenor]]\n[[Category:Objects]]"}}}
