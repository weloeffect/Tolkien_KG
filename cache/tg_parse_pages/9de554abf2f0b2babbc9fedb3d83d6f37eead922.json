Tolkien]] in his early legendarium for the mid-most region of the [[Great Lands]]. In Palisor lay the [[Cuiviénen|Waters of Awakening]], where the Elves awoke.<ref>{{HM|LT1}}, p. 114f</ref>\n\nThe [[Dark Elves]] stayed back in Palisor, and in the unfinished [[Gilfanon's Tale]] we learn that the [[Hisildi]] were ruled by the [[sprites|fay]] [[Tu]], whose dwelling was in the caves below the Waters of Awakening. East of Palisor was the [[Murmenalda]] where the [[Men]] awoke.\n\nIn the outlines of that story, Palisor was the site of the [[Battle of Palisor]], where Elves and Men fought against [[Fankil]]'s [[Dwarves]] and/or [[goblins]].<ref>{{LT1|X}}</ref>\n==Conceptual confusion==\n\nIn ''[[The History of Middle-earth Index]]'', Palisor is correctly described as the region where \"the Elves awoke\", in the index for ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]'' and ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]''. However, in the index for ''[[The Shaping of Middle-earth]]'' and ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]'', Palisor is described to be the region where \"the first Men awoke\". A misconception is likely to have entered the index, as none of the page references point to any other usage of the name Palisor than the birth-place of the Elves.\n\n== Etymology ==\nAccording to [[Christopher Tolkien]]'s reading of the ''[[Qenya Lexicon]]'', 'Palisor' is derived from the root PALA, \"whose derivatives have a common general sense of 'flatness', among them ''palis'' 'sward, lawn', whence no doubt ''Palisor''.\"<ref>{{HM|LT1}}, p. 264</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Great Lands]]\n[[Category:Locations in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Qenya locations]]\n[[Category:Regions]]"}}}
