It was situated some way within the narrow [[Morgul Vale|Morgul Valley]], guarding the pass between [[Ithilien]] and [[Mordor]].\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Matthew Burton - Minas Morgul.jpg|300px|thumb|''Minas Morgul'' by Matthew Burton]]{{blockquote|All was dark about it, earth and sky, but it was lit with light. Not the imprisoned moonlight welling through the marble walls of Minas Ithil long ago, Tower of the Moon, fair and radiant in the hollow of the hills. Paler indeed than the moon ailing in some slow eclipse was the light of it now, wavering and blowing like a noisome exhalation of decay, a corpse-light, a light that illuminated nothing.|''[[The Two Towers]]'', \"[[The Stairs of Cirith Ungol]]\"}}In its prime, Minas Ithil was a beautiful place. It sat high on a rocky seat \"upon the black knees\" of the [[Ephel Dúath]], overlooking the valley. Moonlight reflected off the marble walls of the city so that it seemed to shine. The tall tower of the city had many windows, and the topmost part rotated slowly from one side to the other. A white bridge crossed the nearby [[Morgulduin|river]], with large meadows on both banks of the stream.  \n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Minas Morgul Gate sketch.png|thumb|left|Minas Morgul Gate by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]\nAfter being taken by the forces of evil, the city became terrible, and the valley was filled with decay. The city was lit by a pale white light, and the gate was shaped like an open mouth with gleaming teeth and eyes. The meadows were filled with deadly<ref name=\"Council2\">{{FR|II2}}</ref> white flowers emitting a sickly odour. At the head of the bridge crossing the [[Morgulduin]] were corrupted human and bestial statues. The river steamed a poisonous, deadly cold vapour, and the water was undrinkable.<ref name=\":0\">{{TT|Stairs}}</ref><ref>{{HM|AI}}, figure 170</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 486</ref>\n\nThe city was accessed by the [[Morgul-road]], which ran from Osgiliath to the crossroads and along the north side of the [[Morgulduin]] until across from the city, where it crossed the valley on a white bridge before wounding up to the city gate in the northern wall.<ref name=\":1\">{{TT|Stairs}}, p. 704</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Second Age===\nAfter the destruction of [[Númenor]], [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]], the sons of [[Elendil]], landed in [[Gondor]]. Isildur built Minas Ithil near the mountainous border of [[Mordor]] from where he would rule the fief of [[Ithilien]]; while Anárion built [[Minas Anor]] to rule over the fief of [[Anórien]]. Minas Ithil housed the [[Ithil-stone]], a ''[[Palantíri|palantír]].''<ref>{{TT|Palantir}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Sauron]] returned after escaping [[Númenor]]'s destruction, he attacked the exiles of Númenor, and his forces [[First Fall of Minas Ithil|took Minas Ithil]] by storm. When the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] defeated Sauron in the year {{SA|3429}}, Minas Ithil was restored as a watchtower.\n\n===Third Age===\nAfter the defeat of the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]] in the north, he returned to Mordor in {{TA|1980}}, summoning the other [[Nazgûl]] with him to prepare the return of their master. A few years later ({{TA|2000}}) they laid siege to Minas Ithil and [[Third Age 2002|two years later]] they managed to [[Second Fall of Minas Ithil|take the city]].<ref name=\"ta\">{{App|TA}}</ref> The [[Ithil-stone]] was also captured and later used by Sauron to influence [[Saruman]] and [[Denethor|Denethor II]].<ref name=\"ta\" /><ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref>\n\nMinas Ithil was occupied by fell creatures, and it changed into a foul, evil place.  As a result, it came to be called Minas Morgul, which in the [[Gondor Sindarin|tongue of Gondor]] means \"Tower of Dark Sorcery\". Many [[Gondorians]] fled from [[Ithilien]].<ref name=\"gondor\" />\n\nFrom Minas Morgul the Lord of the Nazgûl twice challenged his old enemy, King [[Eärnur]]. Finally Eärnur rode with his knights against Morgul. He never returned, ending the line of the [[Kings of Gondor]].<ref name=\"ta\" /><ref name=\"gondor\">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Watchful Peace]], the lords of Morgul had secretly bred the [[Uruk-hai]], and in {{TA|2475}} these creatures assailed and overran Ithilien.\n[[File:Daniel Pilla - The Nazgul from Minas Morgul.jpg|thumb|left|''The Nazgul from Minas Morgul'' by [[:Category:Images by Daniel Pilla|Daniel Pilla]]]]\n\n===War of the Ring===\nDuring the [[War of the Ring]], a host from Minas Morgul set forth toward [[Minas Tirith]]. The host was witnessed by Frodo, Sam and Gollum. After some [[Faramir's defence of Osgiliath|opposition in Osgiliath]], the Morgul-host proceeded to the [[Pelennor Fields]] and laid [[Siege of Gondor|siege]] to Minas Tirith. However the host, including the city's garrison was devastated during the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].\n\nFollowing the battle, the [[Army of the West]] pulled down the bridge leading to [[Morgul Vale]] and set its fields aflame. They met no opposition as the entire city's garrison had been killed at the Battle.<ref>{{RK|Gate}}, p. 885</ref>  \n\nAfter the War of the Ring, [[Faramir]] was made [[Prince of Ithilien]] by King [[Aragorn|Elessar]], who advised him to make his abode in the [[Emyn Arnen]] south-east of Minas Tirith for \"Minas Ithil in Morgul Vale shall be utterly destroyed, and though it may in time to come be made clean, no man may dwell there for many long years\".<ref>{{RK|Steward}}, p. 969</ref> It is not known if the city was ever rebuilt.\n==Etymology==\n'''Minas Morgul''' is a [[Sindarin]] name.
