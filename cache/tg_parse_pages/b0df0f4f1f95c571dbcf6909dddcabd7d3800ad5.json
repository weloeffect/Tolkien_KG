Yet those that were wiser feared that new evils will be devised in Angband. Their fears were true, as \"an ill wind from the [[Northlands|North]]\", known only as the Evil Breath, brought a pestilence to those lands that bordered [[Anfauglith]]. Many of those that perished from the sickness were the rising youth and children.<ref name=\"Childhood\"/>\n\nBefore the ending of that year, the Evil Breath had reached [[Dor-lómin]], striking [[Túrin]] with a fever and dark dreams. Due to his fate and strength, he survived the sickness. His sister, [[Urwen]], was not spared however, and Túrin wept bitterly alone that night, grieving for her.<ref name=\"Childhood\"/>\n\nLater, Túrin mentions the Evil Breath during a conversation he has with [[Sador]], considering it to have been a curse by the [[Morgoth|wicked King]].<ref name=\"Childhood\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Great Plague]] - The plague epidemic in the [[Third Age]]\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Evil]]\n\n[[fi:Ilkeä Henkäys]]"}}}
