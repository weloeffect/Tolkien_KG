The [[Witch-king]] was crushed at the [[Battle of Fornost]] ({{TA|1975}}).\n\nAfter the main part of the battle, the Host was joined by a force of [[Elves]] from [[Rivendell]] led by [[Glorfindel]], who chased the [[Witch-king]].<ref name=gondor/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Battle of Fornost]]\n{{title}}\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Armies]]\n[[Category:Arnor]]\n[[Category:Gondor]]"}}}
