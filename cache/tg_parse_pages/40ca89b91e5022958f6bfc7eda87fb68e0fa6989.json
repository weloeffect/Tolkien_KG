It seeks to add to the conversation on what the words 'Goth' and 'Gothic' meant to J.R.R. Tolkien and the ways in which their various associated traditions proliferate his writing. From the linguistic to the literary, religious to the ecocritical, the proceedings explores how traditional and new theories in Gothic scholarship can help us read Tolkien's work anew.\n\nPublished under the auspices of the Society's Peter Roe Memorial Fund, this proceedings features a collection of seven papers delivered at the Tolkien Society Hybrid Seminar 2022.}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.tolkiensociety.org/store/tolkien-and-the-gothic/ Official webpage]\n\n{{peterroe}}\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Publications by the Tolkien Society]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]"}}}
