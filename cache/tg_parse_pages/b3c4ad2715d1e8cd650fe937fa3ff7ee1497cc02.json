It was the chief village of the area with the famous ''[[The Prancing Pony|Prancing Pony Inn]]'' and was populated by Men and Hobbits. The [[East Road]] ran through Bree.\n\n*'''[[Staddle]]''' on the south-eastern slopes of Bree-hill was populated by Men and Hobbits. Pipe-weed grew well on the south-slopes of the hill and was smoked by Bree-hobbits. Most of the Hobbits of Bree-land lived in Staddle in hobbit-holes but there were also houses for Men in Staddle. It was the only of the villages (other than Bree itself) visible from the [[East Road]] and was located north of the East Road.\n\n*'''[[Combe]]''' was located north of the East Road in a deep valley a little further eastward from Staddle.\n\n*'''[[Archet]]''' was located north of the East Road north of Combe among the trees probably on the southern edge of the  [[Chetwood]].\n\n==History==\nThe origins of its [[Men of Bree|inhabitants]] are obscure, but apparently they were [[Pre-Númenóreans]], related to the [[Dunlendings]], who had moved far to the North during the [[Dark Years]], and the Bree-landers managed to survive through the violent history of Middle-earth until they were absorbed into [[Arnor]]. It was also the only place in Middle-earth where Men lived with Hobbits on a daily basis: the population of the Bree-land had become a mix of Men and Hobbits, who had migrated from [[Angmar]] around {{TA|1300}}. The ratio varied between each of the four townships of the Bree-land. \n\nIn any case, they were still thriving in Bree long after Arnor had collapsed and the memory of [[Kings of Arnor|fallen kings]] faded into the grass. The now independent land enjoyed the (unknowing) protection of the [[Rangers of the North]]. After the [[War of the Ring]], Bree-land became part of the [[Reunited Kingdom]].\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Bree-Land map.jpg|left|thumb|Map of Bree-land from ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] offered to construct new names for place names and to find places for them on the map of Bree in a [[Letter 276|letter]] that he wrote to [[Dick Plotz]] on 12 September 1965.<ref>{{L|276}}</ref> As a consequence, it is possible that there were more settlements in Bree-land than the four, which were mentioned in ''The Lord of the Rings''.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Bree-land is a major region and one of the starting locations available to new characters. It encompasses not only the four villages and their immediate surroundings, but all the terrain from [[Buckland]] in the far west to the [[Weather Hills]] to the far east. The [[Old Forest]], [[Barrow-downs]], [[Midgewater Marshes]] and [[Chetwood]] are all included within its boundaries.\n\n:During the [[War of the Ring]], Bree-land is threatened by both [[Isengard]] and [[Angmar]]. [[Saruman]]'s [[ruffians]] and [[half-orcs]] came up from the south and camp at [[Andrath]] and the \"Bree-fields\", while Angmar's Orcs encroach from the [[North Downs]]. Angmar also temporarily secured the allegiance of the \"Blackwold\" bandit gang, which sets off the events of the Bree-land introduction quests.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Arnor]]\n[[Category:Eriador]]\n[[Category:Regions]]\n[[de:Breeland]]\n[[fi:Briimaa]]\n[[Category:Bree-land]]"}}}
