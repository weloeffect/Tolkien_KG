By {{TA|3019}} she was the oldest woman working there and was well versed in old lore. Upon seeing the illness-stricken [[Faramir]], she said that she wished there was still a king in Gondor, remarking \"For it is said in old lore: ''The hands of the king are the hands of a healer''.\" [[Gandalf]] heard this, and brought [[Aragorn]] to the Houses of Healing, where he was able to heal many of the sick. Ioreth was very talkative, which annoyed Aragorn and Gandalf.<ref>{{RK|Houses}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Ioreth'' means \"old woman\" in [[Sindarin]]; ''[[iaur]]'' (\"old\") plus feminine ending ''[[-eth]]''. In draft, Tolkien had spelt her name ''Yoreth''.<ref name=Joukes>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], \"[[Letter to Mr Joukes|Letter to a Mr. Joukes dated August 28, 1967]]\", published in [[Wayne G.
