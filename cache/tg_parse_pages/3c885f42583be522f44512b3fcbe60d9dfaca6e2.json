There, Éadgifu gave birth to their son Ælfwine, who inherited her mother's unquenchable longing for the sea.<ref name=\"Deo\"/>\n\nHowever, while Ælfwine was still a boy, a fierce people called the [[Forodwaith (The Book of Lost Tales)|Forodwaith]] (i.e. [[wikipedia:Vikings|Vikings]]) attacked Kortirion and laid siege to it, during which Déor died leading a \"desperate sally\" before the walls,<ref name=\"Deo\">{{LT2|VIb}}, p. 313-4</ref> slain by [[Orm]] the sea-captain of the Forodwaith.<ref>{{LT2|VIb}}, p. 318</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''Déor'' is in [[Old English]], meaning \"brave, bold\".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 643</ref>\n\nIn one occurrence, the character was called ''Heorrenda'' before being changed back to ''Déor''.<ref>{{LT2|VIb}}, ''Changes made to names, and differences in names, in the texts of Ælfwine of England'', p. 334</ref>\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | DEO |y| EAD |DEO='''DÉOR'''|EAD=[[Éadgifu]]|}}\n{{familytree | | | |!| | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | ÆLF | | |ÆLF=[[Ælfwine]]|}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n== Inspiration ==\nThe character of Déor was probably inspired by the Old English poem ''[[Déor (poem)|Déor]]'', which also features a minstrel as the eponymous main character.
