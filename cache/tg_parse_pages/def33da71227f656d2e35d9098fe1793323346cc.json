I was very pleased to hear of the pleasure my book has given you. I think I agree with you in the matter of making a film out of the story. There have been some serious negotiations with regard to this, but my experience with scripts and “story-line” has warned me that only an overwhelming financial reward could possibly compensate an author for the horrors of the conversion of such a tale into film. Even when the pictorial part is very good.<br/><br/>Fortunately, my publishers and I retain a legal hold in this matter and nothing can be done without our approval in detail. I am myself a member of the amorphous body of “fandom”: but I am afraid I do not often come across anything nowadays that seems very readable.}}\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Letters|Triode]]"}}}
