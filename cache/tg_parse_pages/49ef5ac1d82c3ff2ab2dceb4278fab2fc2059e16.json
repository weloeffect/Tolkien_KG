Their existence, along with the [[Eä|Universe]] in which they were to live, was conceived in the [[Music of the Ainur]], but the [[Ainur]] had no part in their making. [[Ilúvatar]] alone brought them into being, and they had ''[[fëar]]'' (spirits) of the same type as the Ainur, though far less powerful.\n\n==History==\nUnlike the Ainur, however, the Children were intended to exist as a union of flesh and spirit; their bodies, or ''[[hröar]]'', are as integral to their being as their ''[[fëar]]''. As such, they are also called [[Incarnate]]s.\n\nWhile their status as embodied souls created by Ilùvatar makes them extraordinarily alike, each Kindred of the Children was also bestowed with different gifts from their maker. The Elves received great beauty, near [[immortality]], skill with arts and crafts, and keen memories. Men, on the other hand, were given freedom to act outside the boundaries set by the [[Music of the Ainur]], eventual [[Dominion of Men|supremacy]] over [[Middle-earth]], and [[Gift of Men|mortality]].<ref>{{S|Beginning}}</ref>\n\nElves were the first of the Children of Ilúvatar to appear in [[Middle-earth]]; Men were not to follow until the first rising of the [[Sun]] at the end of the [[First Age]], many thousands of years later. Both Kindreds awoke in the far east of Middle-earth: the Elves at [[Cuiviénen]] and Men in [[Hildórien]].\n\nThe [[Dwarves]], while also incarnates, are not typically called Children of Ilúvatar, for though they were given sapience and independent being by [[Ilúvatar]], they were in fact created by [[Aulë]]. When Eru gave blessing to Aulë's work, he distinguished the Dwarves from Elves and Men by calling them \"the children of my adoption\" while referring to Elves and Men as \"the children of my choice.\"<ref>{{S|Aule}}</ref>\n\n==Parallels between Men and Elves==\n[[File:Sara M. Morello - I will tell him - Andreth and Finrod.jpg|thumb|''Andreth and Finrod'' by [[:Category:Images by Sara M. Morello|Sara M. Morello]]]]\nThe history of Men and their races throughout the Ages, bore some similarities to that of the Elves, especially during the [[First Age]].\n\nBoth Elves and Men originated somewhere in the East ([[Cuiviénen]] and [[Hildórien]]) and then both marched for the [[Westlands|West]] ([[Eldar]] and [[Edain]]) leaving many of them behind ([[Avari]] and [[Men of Darkness]]).\n\nThey were divided mainly into three groups ([[Vanyar]]/[[Noldor]]/[[Teleri]] and [[House of Beor]]/[[House of Hador]]/[[House of Haleth]]) when they reached [[Beleriand]].\n\nEventually some of them ([[Calaquendi]] and [[Númenóreans]]) passed the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] and reached a western place ([[Valinor]] and [[Númenor]]). They advanced and prospered near the [[Light of Valinor]] while their kin were left behind in [[Middle-earth]].\n\nThere, some were corrupted by the [[Sauron|Enemy]] which caused a Fall ([[Fall of the Noldor|Noldolantë]] and [[Downfall of Númenor|Atalantë]]). A part of them returned to Middle-earth and founded realms ([[Exile of the Noldor]] and [[Realms in Exile]]) becoming Kings among their \"lesser\" kin.\n\n==Etymology==\n'''''Eruhíni''''' (sing. ''Eruhin'') is the [[Quenya]] term. It contains the name ''[[Eru]]'', [[the One]] (a name for [[Ilúvatar]]) and ''hína'' (\"child\").<ref name=WJ>{{WJ|AD1}}, p. 403</ref>\n\nThe [[Sindarin]] cognate was '''''Eruchîn'''''.<ref>{{LB|4}}, p. 354 (cf.
