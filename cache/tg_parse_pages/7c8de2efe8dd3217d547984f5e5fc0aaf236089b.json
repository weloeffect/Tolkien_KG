Aldarion, though, felt the call of the sea, and he, along with the [[Guild of Venturers]] of Númenor, built a vast ship, larger than any that had been seen at that time that they called ''Palarran''.\n\nWhen Palarran was finished, Tar-Meneldur felt unquiet and forbade the Queen and Aldarion's sisters from bringing to the ship a bough of ''[[oiolairë]]'', the token of friendship with [[Ossë]] and [[Uinen]]. [[Erendis]], instead of Aldarion's kin, brought a bough to the ship, which first caused the prince to love the maiden.\n\nAldarion sailed the Palarran upon the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] to [[Middle-earth]] several times.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}, pp. 178-179</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Palarran'' means \"Far-Wanderer\" in [[Quenya]],<ref>{{UT|Wife}}, p. 178.
