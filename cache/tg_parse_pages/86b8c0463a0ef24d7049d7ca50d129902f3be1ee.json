The new young King [[Araphor]] repelled the enemy from Fornost and the North Downs.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', entry for King Arveleg I, p. 1040</ref>\n\n===Fall===\nIn {{TA|1974}},<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1974, p. 1086</ref> the forces of the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]] invaded Arthedain before the end of the winter and [[Fall of Fornost|captured]] Fornost<ref name=\"Arvedui\">{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', entry for King Arvedui, pp. 1041-2</ref>. King [[Arvedui]] first resisted on the North Downs until the last, then fled with some of his guard to [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] mines at the northern end of the [[Blue Mountains]] and drowned in the [[Icebay of Forochel]] with the two [[Palantíri]] he had saved from the forces of Angmar in March of the following<ref name=\"TA1975\">{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1975, p. 1086</ref> year<ref name=\"Arvedui\" />.

The [[Elves of Lindon]] led by [[Círdan]], the remaining [[Dúnedain]] of the North<ref name=\"Eärnil\" />, and some [[Hobbits]] from the [[The Shire|Shire]]<ref name=\"Arvedui\" /> joined the [[Host of the West (Arnor)|Host of the West]]<ref name=\"Eärnil\" />. Eärnur fought the Witch-king of Angmar in the plains west of Fornost and [[Battle of Fornost|defeated]] the armies of Angmar, but the Witch-king himself escaped.<ref name=\"Eärnil\" /> After the death of King Arvedui and the defeat of the army of Angmar, the Kingdom of Arthedain ended, because few Dúnedain of the North were left and the population of all the other peoples of [[Eriador]] had decreased. The Dúnedain of the North turned into a secret and wandering people that passed into the shadows.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', entry for Chieftain Aranarth, p. 1043</ref> As a consequence, it is possible that Fornost was abandoned after the the defeat of the army of Angmar.\n\n===Legacy===\nAfter Fornost Erain was abandoned, [[Men]] referred to it as '''Deadmen's Dike''' and feared to go there.<ref name=\"Council\" /> According to [[Barliman Butterbur]], the innkeeper of [[The Prancing Pony]], Fornost was said to be a haunted land. However, the [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]] went there,<ref name=\"Homeward\">{{RK|Homeward}}, p. 933</ref> but it is not known what they did there and how long they stayed there.\n\nIt is possible that Fornost was rebuilt and resettled after [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] [[Reunited Kingdom|reunited Gondor and Arnor]], as Gandalf had announced that King Elessar would go there again one day and fair folk would be riding through [[Bree]] and that many folk used to live at the end of the Greenway on the North Downs.<ref name=\"Homeward\" />\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Fornost.mp3|Ardamir}}\n''Fornost Erain'' is [[Sindarin]] for \"Northern Fortress (of the) Kings\", being a compound of ''forn'' (\"north\") + ''[[ost]]'' (\"fortress\") and ''erain'', the plural of ''[[aran]]'' (\"king\").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 19</ref>\n\nThe [[Westron]] names of ''Fornost Erain'' and ''Fornost'' were \"Norbury of the Kings\"<ref name=\"Homeward\" /> and \"Norbury\",<ref>{{FR|Ordering}}, p. 9</ref> respectively.
