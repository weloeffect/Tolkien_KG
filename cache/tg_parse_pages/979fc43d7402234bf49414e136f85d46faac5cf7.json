The Noldor and their allies possessed insufficient force to assault [[Angband]] directly.<ref name=\"Return\">{{S|13}}</ref> \n\nIn the west [[Fingolfin]] and [[Fingon]] guarded the pass over [[Ered Wethrin]] into [[Hithlum]] from [[Barad Eithel]], while [[Finrod]] and [[Orodreth]] held the pass of Sirion from [[Minas Tirith (Beleriand)|Minas Tirith]] and [[Angrod]] with [[Aegnor]] held the northern slopes of [[Dorthonion]] to the borders of the [[Pass of Aglon|Aglon]]. In the east the [[Sons of Fëanor]] held watch; [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]] held the land between the rivers [[Aros]] and [[Celon]], [[Maedhros]] had his stronghold on [[Himring]] while he guarded the Marches north of that hill and the plains between the rivers Celon and [[Gelion]], [[Maglor]] kept watch over the northern hills of the river Gelion, and [[Caranthir]] in the shadows of [[Ered Luin]].<ref>{{LR|AB}} pp. 127-8</ref>\n\nIt was during the Siege that [[Turgon]]'s people left [[Nevrast]] to build [[Gondolin]].<ref>{{S|15}}</ref> Other Elven cities, [[Brithombar]] and [[Eglarest]] were also established by the [[Sindar]] on [[Falas]], and [[Nargothrond]], the realm of [[Finrod]]. The siege was incomplete, as Morgoth was still capable of sending out various forces of orcs to harass the elves, such as the attack of [[Hithlum]]; but the Noldor were grown strong enough, that these task forces posed no significant threat.\n\nAbout 200 years into the Siege, [[Glaurung]] came forth from Angband, and although he was yet young and not fully grown, many fled in terror. However, Fingon led a group of archers on horseback against him, and Glaurung was forced to return to Angband. After the defeat of Glaurung, a period called [[Long Peace]] began, and [[Beleriand]] prospered greatly during this time.<ref name=Return /> The [[Men]] of the [[House of Bëor]] entered Beleriand and were followed by the [[Haladin]].\n\nYears after the [[Battle of the Pass of Aglon]], the [[Forest of Brethil]] was given to the Haladin. A final band of Men, the [[House of Hador]], came to Beleriand; they were given the lands of [[Dor-lómin]].\n\nAfter about four hundred years, the Siege was broken in the [[Dagor Bragollach]].<ref>{{S|18}}</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Conflicts of the First Age]]\n[[Category:Sieges]]\n[[fi:Angbandin Piiritys]]"}}}
