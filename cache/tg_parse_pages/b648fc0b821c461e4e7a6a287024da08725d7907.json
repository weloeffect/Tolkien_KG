He enquired of Lindo regarding the Sun and Moon. [[Gilfanon]] was among the guests of the [[Cottage of Lost Play]] at that time, and [[Lindo]] remarked that it would be well for Eriol to travel with Gilfanon to his [[House of the Hundred Chimneys]], for Gilfanon could tell him much of such things. Gilfanon joked that one might think Lindo was trying to get rid of two guests at once, but said that he would stay for about a week, and that Lindo could now tell the tale. Pleased, Lindo did so:\n\nAfter the flight of [[Noldoli]] and slaughter of [[Solosimpi]], the Elves and Valar were outraged.\n\n[[Vána]] and [[Irmo|Lórien]] with [[Arien|Urwendi]], [[Silmo]], and many other Valar and Elves unsuccessfully tried to heal the Trees, but they were only wasting the light that remained. [[Manwë]] and [[Aulë]] stopped them and [[Yavanna]] was asked to heal the trees. She agreed but was not expecting success.\n\nShe put forth all her power, but to no avail. However, Vána stayed with [[Laurelin]] and wept when the others had gone in despair. Much to Vána's surprise, a shoot sprang from Laurelin where her tears had fallen, and she called to the folk of Valinor, who rushed to see what had happened. Yavanna was praised for her spells, but she said Vána's tenderness was the true cause of the healing. After some time the branch produced a single golden fruit. Then Aulë with the help of the others made a vessel for the fruit, a ship named by the Valar ''Sári'', meaning the Sun, and by the Elves ''Ûr'', meaning fire. Urwendi and her maidens volunteered to steer the Sun across the sky, and it rose into the heavens and filled the world with light. \n\nBut its flaming was overpowering, and Lórien sang to [[Silpion]] that the Valar were trapped between golden heat and shadows full of death. When he touched its wound, one of the branches produced the gleaming Rose of Silver, from which Aulë made a second vessel, the Ship of the [[Moon]] (''Rána'' or ''Sil''). Silmo longed to sail it, but he could not, and Manwë chose [[Ilinsor]] for the task.\n==See also==\n*[[Of the Sun and Moon and the Hiding of Valinor]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tale of the Sun and Moon}}"}}}
