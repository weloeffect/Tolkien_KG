To [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]], their fair elven faces seemed neither old nor young. While in the [[Grey Company]], they wore cloaks of silver-grey over bright mail.<ref name=\"Passing\" />\n\n==History==\nIn the year {{TA|2509}} the twins' mother Celebrían went on a journey into the south to visit her own mother, [[Galadriel]], in the land of [[Lothlórien|Lórien]].<ref name=\"Arahad\">{{App|Eriador}}, entry for Chieftain Arahad I, p. 1043</ref> In the [[Redhorn Pass]], she was captured by [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]], and tortured<ref name=\"Arahad\" /> in their dens<ref name=\"Meetings\">{{FR|Meetings}}, p. 227</ref>. The twins rode to rescue her, but by the time they reached her, she had received a poisonous wound. Though their father healed her, she would not remain in [[Middle-earth]], and sailed into the [[Aman|West]] the following year.<ref name=\"Arahad\" /> After this loss, Elladan and Elrohir never forgot their mother's torture in the dens of the Orcs and often rode far from Rivendell with the [[Rangers of the North]].<ref name=\"Meetings\" />\n\nIn {{TA|2933|n}},<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2933, p. 1089</ref> they saw [[Arathorn II]] killed by orcs while hunting with him.<ref>{{App|Tale}}, p. 1057</ref>\n\n===War of the Ring===\n{{expansion}}\nIn the early part of the [[War of the Ring]], the brothers' main role was to scout the land and prepare the way for the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]]. Around [[November]] of {{TA|3018}}, they were sent by Elrond on a secret errand. They passed down the [[Silverlode]] into a \"[[Lothlórien|strange country]]\" and were the last to return to [[Rivendell]] in [[December]].<ref>{{FR|South}}, p. 274</ref>\n\nLater, they took a more active part. When [[Halbarad]] rode to [[Aragorn]]'s aid with the [[Grey Company]], Elladan and Elrohir accompanied them and Elrohir gave counsel from [[Elrond|his father]] to Aragorn to \"remember the [[Paths of the Dead]]\".<ref>{{RK|Company}}, p. 775</ref> They followed Aragorn through the [[Paths of the Dead]], fought with him at [[Pelargir]], and took part in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], where they fought with stars bound to their brows. Both were present at a council of Aragorn and his captains, and then accompanied the force that fought in the [[Battle of the Morannon]].\n\nAfter the celebrations and the coronation of Aragorn, the brothers departed [[Minas Tirith]] on [[8 May]]. On [[14 June]] they met with the escort of their [[Arwen|sister]] on her way to [[Gondor]] to marry Aragorn, and together they went to [[Edoras]]. They stayed there for [[16 June|two days]] before setting out for Gondor. They arrived to the City on [[1 Lithe]]<ref>{{app|Chief}}</ref> and the brothers held a silver banner.<ref>{{RK|Steward}}</ref>\n\n===Later fate===\nAfter the War, little is known of the brothers' fate. They returned to their father's house at Rivendell and remained there even after their father had passed across the [[Belegaer|Sea]].<ref name=\"Rec\">{{FR|Records}}</ref> Like their sister [[Arwen]], the sons of Elrond [[Half-elven]] were granted the choice of whether to leave [[Middle-earth]] for the [[Undying Lands]], or remain there and become [[Gift of Men|mortal]] as [[Men]]. They chose, for a time at least, to stay in Middle-earth for reasons unknown.<ref>{{L|153}}</ref> However, due to the fact that shortly before Aragorn died in {{FoA|120}}, he said to Arwen that 'none now walk' in the garden of Elrond, indicating that the last of the [[Eldar]] had departed to [[Valinor]],<ref>{{App|Tale}}</ref> and that [[Celeborn]] dwelt in Rivendell for a while before he eventually departed over the Sea,<ref name=\"Rec\" /> it seems likely that both twins had left Rivendell before or at the time of their grandfather's last trip for the Undying Lands.\n\n==Etymology==\n===Elladan===\n''Elladan'' is [[Sindarin]] for \"Elf-man\", from ''[[el]]'' (\"elf\") + ''[[adan]]'' (\"man\"). It could also be translated as \"Elf-Númenórean\", as ''adan'' refers to the [[Edain]], who later became [[Númenóreans]].<ref name=\"twins\">{{L|211}}, pp. 281-2</ref>\n\n===Elrohir===\n''Elrohir'' is Sindarin for \"Elf-man\" or \"Elf-knight\", from ''el'' (\"elf\") + ''[[rohir]]'' (\"horse-lord\").<ref name=\"twins\" />\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| FIN |y| EAW | | GLN | | TUO |y| IDR | | DIO |y| NIM | |FIN=[[Finarfin]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT|1230}}''</small>|EAW=[[Eärwen]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|GLN=[[Galadhon]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA}}''</small>|TUO=[[Tuor]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA|472}}''</small>|IDR=[[Idril]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|DIO=[[Dior]]<br /><small>''{{FA|470}} - {{FA|506|n}}''</small>|NIM=[[Nimloth of Doriath|Nimloth]]<br /><small>''d. {{FA|506}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | |!| | | | | |!| | | | | |!| | | | | | | |!| | | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | GAL |~|y|~| CEL | | | | EAR |~|~|y|~|~| ELW | | | |GAL=[[Galadriel]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT|1362}}''</small>|CEL=[[Celeborn]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA}}''</small>|EAR=[[Eärendil]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA|503}}''</small>|ELW=[[Elwing]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA|503}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | |,|-|-|^|-|.| | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | CLB |~|~|~|y|~|~|~| ELR | | | ELS | | | | | | |CLB=[[Celebrían]]<br /><small>''b. {{SA|300}}''</small>|ELR=[[Elrond]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA|532}}''</small>|ELS=[[Elros]]<br /><small>''{{FA|532}} - {{SA|442}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|.| | | | | |:| | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | ELL | | ELO | | ARW |~|y|~| ARA | | | | | | |ELL='''ELLADAN'''<br /><small>''b. {{TA|130}}''</small>|ELO='''ELROHIR'''<br /><small>''b. {{TA|130}}''</small>|ARW=[[Arwen]]<br /><small>''{{TA|241}} - {{FoA|121}}''</small>|ARA=[[Aragorn|Aragorn II]]<br /><small>''{{TA|2931}} - {{FoA|120}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |,|-|^|-|.| | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | EDN | | DAU | | | | | | | |EDN=[[Eldarion]]<br /><small>''b. {{FoA|1}}''</small>|DAU=''unknown<br/>daughters''}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Elladan and Elrohir in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Decipher - Elrohir.jpg|Elrohir in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]''\nFile:Decipher - Elladan.jpg|Elladan in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings War in the North - Elladan.jpg|Elladan in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings War in the North - Elrohir.jpg|Elrohir in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Elladan.jpg|Elladan in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Elrohir.jpg|Elrohir in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\nFile:Elladan and Elrohir Born of Hope.jpeg|Elladan and Elrohir in [[Born of Hope|''Born of Hope'']]\nFile:SBG - Elrohir.jpeg|Elrohir in ''[[Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game]]''\nFile:SBG - Elladan.jpeg|Elladan in ''[[Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game]]''\n</gallery>\n'''1979: [[The Lord of the Rings (1979 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1979 radio series)]]:'''\n:Elladan and Elrohir follow [[Halbarad]] and come to [[Aragorn]]'s aid.
