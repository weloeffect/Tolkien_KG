They were believed to have been descended from the same group of Men as the [[Edain]], the [[Atanatári]], with the only difference being that they did not cross the [[Ered Luin]] into [[Beleriand]]. Therefore, the Northmen did not go to [[Númenor]] and, as a result of them not participating in the [[Battles of Beleriand|War]] against [[Morgoth]], their lifespan was considerably shorter than that of the Dúnedain, whose lifespan was enhanced by the [[Valar]] after the [[War of Wrath]].\n\nThe Northmen were a confederation of powerful peoples, who were numerous and dwelt in the plains of Rhovanion, namely between [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]] and [[Celduin]]. Their homes were in the eaves of the Great Forest, having deforested the region of the [[East Bight]].<ref name=\"SecondParagraph\" /> The [[Men of Dale]] and [[Lake-town]] were also counted under the Northmen, as were the [[Woodmen]] of [[Mirkwood]]. Most of Rhovanion had been depopulated after the wars of the [[Easterlings]] and the [[Great Plague]].\n\n==Origins==\n{{seealso|Middle Men}}\nThe Northmen descended from the group of the [[Edain]] who left their kin to reach the West, being always at war with the [[Men of Darkness]].<ref name=\"DM\">{{PM|X}}</ref> The \"Bëorians\" were on the vanguard and the \"Hadorians\" followed on their trail, but the latter were divided while passing through [[Greenwood]]. [[Men of the Vales of Anduin|Some]] Hadorians reached the [[Vales of Anduin]] and turned northwards, while others passed between the northernmost eaves of the Wood and the [[Ered Mithrin]]. Only a few of them reached [[Eriador]] and [[Beleriand]].<ref name=\"relations\" /> As such, the Northmen appear to be akin to the [[House of Hador]] who stayed behind in [[Rhovanion]].<ref name=\"relations\" /><ref>{{UT|8e}}, note 4</ref>\n\n==History==\n===First Age===\nDuring these migrations, many [[Men]] wandered or settled the empty lands between the [[Iron Hills]], the [[Greenwood]], and the [[Inland Sea]].<ref>{{PM|Atani}}</ref> Those Men of [[Rhovanion]] settled near the lands of the [[Longbeards]]. The Men looked at the [[Dwarves]] with awe (although it is said that they had met evil ones in the east)<ref name=\"PM|XNotes\">{{PM|XNotes}}, note 28</ref> and were eager to learn from them. \n\nBy the end of the [[First Age]], the Men who settled between the [[Grey Mountains]] and Greenwood were numerous (compared to the Dwarves) but scattered across villages.\n\n===Second Age===\nAfter the [[War of Wrath]], former [[Orcs]] of [[Morgoth]], now leaderless and reckless, but still numerous, armed, and cruel, turned to the East and started harassing the lands. Those Men who settled in small towns could defend themselves only with [[bows]], fences, and dikes. In the battles that followed, Dwarves and Men were threatened. The Dwarves, outnumbered, were glad to make an alliance with Men. Men chiefly provided food in exchange for Dwarven work in building, road-construction, mining, and the crafting of tools and weapons.<ref name=\"PM|XNotes\" /> At first, this system benefited the Dwarves, as the services they provided to Men required less effort than those offered in exchange. However, Men eventually became wiser and developed skills of their own.<ref name=\"relations\">{{PM|Relations}}</ref>\n\nWith better weapons, protection, and riding skills of their own, Men could watch and defend the plains and vales where no Orc could then venture without danger. Thus, the [[Alliance of Dwarves and Men]] was formed, resulting in mutual respect and also warm friendship.<ref name=\"relations\" /> During this period, the Longbeards adopted the [[Northern Mannish|speech]] of Men, keeping [[Khuzdul|their own language]] to themselves.<ref name=\"relations\" /><ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref>\n\nThe Alliance ended in the [[Dark Years]] when [[Sauron]] sent Orcs to invade the peoples<!-- does \"the peoples\" here refer to the Free peoples? Or was it just referring to the Northmen? I don't have access to the cited book. --> and the Dwarves closed themselves in their mansions. The Northmen also had a war with the savage tribes of [[Easterlings]] which scattered them and diminished their numbers<!-- the Easterlings' numbers or the Northmen's numbers? -->. Those <!-- \"Those\" who? -->who remained there were impoverished, living in caves or in the borders of [[Greenwood]].<ref name=\"relations\" /> [[Rhovanion]] fell under the dominion of [[Sauron]] before being liberated by [[Gil-galad]].\n\n===Third Age===\nThe [[Kings of Gondor]] recognised their common ancestry with the Men of Rhovanion and showed them great favour. For a time, many of them even became subjects of Gondor, as the realm extended beyond the river [[Anduin]]. In c {{TA|1000}}, they were given wide lands south of [[Greenwood the Great]] to serve as a buffer against the [[Easterlings]].<ref name=\"Foster\">{{HM|Guide}}, p. 293-4</ref> They increased greatly during [[Gondor]]'s golden age,<ref name=\"gondor\">{{App|Gondor}}</ref> and east of Greenwood the Great was the \"kingdom of Rhovanion\".\n[[File:Liz Danforth - Vidugavia.jpg|thumb|left|''Vidugavia'' by [[Liz Danforth]]]]\nHowever, some Northmen were hostile to [[Gondor]] and often assailed the kingdom,<ref name=\"gondor\">{{App|Gondor}}</ref><ref>{{TT|IV5}}</ref> Some joined the Easterlings, who resumed their attacks, either because of feuds or because of greed for spoil, as [[Regent of Gondor|Regent]] [[Minalcar]] found out. In the thirteenth century of the [[Third Age]], Minalcar ensured their loyalty by crushing the Easterlings in {{TA|1248}} with the help of Prince [[Vidugavia]], the so-called \"King of Rhovanion\". Minalcar then took many Northmen as officers in the army of Gondor (although the high men of Gondor looked askance at them),<ref name=\"Foster\" /><ref name=\"gondor\" /> and sent his son [[Valacar]] as an ambassador to Vidugavia. Valacar married the daughter of Vidugavia, [[Vidumavi]], and their son, ''[[Vinitharya]]'' (in his mother tongue) succeeded him as King [[Eldacar (King of Gondor)|Eldacar]]. His mixed ancestry caused a civil war in Gondor, the [[Kin-strife]], in {{TA|1447}}.\n\nThe Northmen's existence was a bulwark of [[Gondor]], keeping its northern and eastern frontiers from invasion. They were weakened by the [[Great Plague]], which appeared in the winter of {{TA|1635}} and soon spread to Gondor. The Horsemen suffered because the Plague came with a cold winter and they had only low wooden houses and thronged stables, and because they possessed little skill in the arts of healing and medicine. The Plague resulted in the deaths of half of Rhovanion, and of their horses also. They were slow to recover, but they were undisturbed, since the hostile Easterlings had been equally afflicted.<ref>{{UT|Northmen}}, third and fourth paragraph</ref>\n\nWhen the invasions of the [[Wainriders]] began against Gondor, the Northmen suffered the first assaults. Their scattered remains were recruited by King [[Narmacil II]] who took a great army north into the plains south of [[Mirkwood]]. They were defeated in the [[Battle of the Plains]] ({{TA|1856}}) where Narmacil and [[Marhari]] were killed. Most of the Northmen were reduced to servitude, and all their former lands were occupied by the Wainriders. A few managed to flee to Gondor, others fled over the [[River Running|Celduin]] and were merged with their kin, while the folk of [[Dale]] under [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] and others followed [[Marhwini]] to the [[Vales of Anduin]] and became the [[Éothéod]].<ref>{{UT|Northmen}}, fourth and fifth paragraph</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|1899}}, Marhwini prepared an outbreak against the Wainrider occupation. After helping [[Calimehtar (King of Gondor)|Calimehtar]] in fighting them in [[Dagorlad]], desperate poorly-armed outlaws came out of Mirkwood and roused the slaves. They burned many Wainriders' dwellings, storehouses, and fortified camps of wagons. Most of them perished in the attempt fighting the Wainriders' youths, women, and old men. Marhwini retired to his land beside the Anduin, and the Northmen of his race never again returned to their former homes.<ref>{{UT|Northmen}}, sixth and seventh paragraph</ref> Afterwards, they battled with the enemies alone since Gondor could not help them. Still, they joined the forces of Gondor against [[Angmar]], and many Northmen comprised the army of the [[Battle of Fornost]] ({{TA|1975}}).<ref name=\"gondor\" />\n\n[[File:Donato Giancola - Fram Franson.jpg|thumb|''Fram'' by [[Donato Giancola]]]]\nAfter the evil Kingdom of [[Angmar]] was defeated by Gondor and the remains of [[Arnor]] in {{TA|1977}}, these Northmen moved north. They were skilled horse-breeders and horsemen. In {{TA|2510}} they responded to a plea of help from the trapped Gondorian army at the [[Field of Celebrant]]. After they helped Gondor win this important victory, they were rewarded the province of [[Calenardhon]], which became known as [[Rohan]].\n\nBy the late Third Age, the Northmen were spread throughout the lands east of the [[Misty Mountains]]. However, they had largely ceased to be a united people, as the Kingdom of Rhovanion was no more. Men who were of Northmen descent included the [[Rohirrim]], the [[Men of Dale]] (later known as the [[Bardings]]), the [[Lake-men]], the [[Beornings]], and the [[Woodmen]] of Mirkwood.\n\nIn later centuries, it is mentioned that the Northmen of Dale and Esgaroth were allied with [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] and, with [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] weapons, they drove their enemies back to [[Rhûn]]. However, they did not prevent the enemies from reaching the gates of Erebor during the [[War of the Ring]].<ref name=\"Foster\" />\n\n==Language==\nSince the Northmen were mostly descended from the [[Edain]], their languages were related to [[Adûnaic]] and some languages still bore a great resemblance to [[Westron]]. This language family included the languages of the peoples of the upper [[Vales of Anduin]] (the [[Beornings]] and the [[Woodmen|Woodmen of Western Mirkwood]]), the [[Lake-men]], and the [[Men of Dale]]. The [[Rohirrim]] still spoke their ancestral tongue, giving new names in it to nearly all the places in [[Rohan]]. The [[Kings of Rohan]] used the Common Speech and spoke it nobly like the [[Gondorians]]; a more gracious and antique style of the language.<ref name=\"languages\">{{App|Men}}</ref> The [[House of Eorl|Kings and their descendants]] after [[Thengel]] also knew the [[Sindarin]] tongue - the language of the nobles of [[Gondor]].<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, note 2</ref>  \n\n==Inspiration==\n\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] was possibly inspired by the ancient [[Wikipedia:Norsemen|Northmen]] of northern Europe (These \"Northmen\" appear in his poem \"[[The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm's Son]]\".<ref>{{HB|II}}</ref>) and their language is rendered with [[North Germanic languages|Old Norse]]. A significant difference is that the real Northmen were mostly sea-faring peoples while the Northmen of [[Rhovanion]] were continental.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Forodwaith (people)|Forodwaith]]\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Northmen| ]]\n[[de:Nordmenschen]]\n[[fr:encyclo/peuples/hommes/hommes du nord]]\n[[fi:Pohjalaiset]]"}}}
