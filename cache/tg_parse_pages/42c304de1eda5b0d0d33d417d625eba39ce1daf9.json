Perhaps because Bilbo was proud of ''Errantry'''s metrical devices, he transformed and (incongruously) applied that poem to the legends of the [[First Age]].<ref>{{ATB|Foreword}}</ref> Aragorn's contributions included his request for a [[Elfstone|green jewel]] in the song; Bilbo obeyed, but inaccurately referred to it as an emerald.<ref>{{FR|II1}}, p. 237</ref>\n\n==Division of the poem==\n#An introduction to [[Eärendil]] and the building of his [[Vingilot|ship]]\n#A detailed description of him, the final line of which was supposedly influenced by [[Aragorn]]\n#A description of his fruitless wanderings in search of [[Valinor]]\n#How [[Elwing]] his wife flew to him in the form of a bird and bound the jewel to his forehead\n#How he found Valinor\n#Concerning his stay there\n#How they built a new ship for him, and how [[Varda|Elbereth]] gave him wings\n#How he left Valinor\n#How he passed over [[Middle-earth]] and became a [[Star of Eärendil|star]]\n\n==Metre and assonance==\nThe metre is iambic tetrameter.<ref group=\"note\">Many of the poems in ''The Lord of the Rings'' are in this metre.</ref> The poem is structured according to trisyllabic assonances, inherited from \"Errantry\".<ref name=\"l133\" /> These are units of three syllables in which the first and third syllables of one unit, which are accented, rhyme or off-rhyme with the first and third syllables of another. The off-rhymes are typically assonances, that is, matching vowel sounds, though some only have similar vowels, and often the consonants are similar or the same as well.\n\nFor example,\n\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nThe winds of wrath came <span style=\"color: red;\">driving him</span>,\nand <span style=\"color: red;\">blindly in</span> the <span style=\"color: blue;\">foam he fled</span>\nfrom west to east and <span style=\"color: green;\">errandless</span>,\nun<span style=\"color: green;\">heralded</span> he <span style=\"color: blue;\">homeward sped</span>.\n</poem>\n\nHere \"fled\" rhymes with \"sped\", but in addition, the vowel of \"foam\" is the same as the first vowel of \"homeward\".  Thus the matching units are \"foam he fled\" and \"homeward sped\".  Another pair of matching units is \"driving him\" and \"blindly in\".  Another is \"errandless\" and \"[un]heralded\".\n\nThe pattern is the same throughout the poem. In every set of four lines, the last three syllables of the first line match the second, third and fourth of the second line.  The third and fourth lines have the same kind of matching.  And the last three syllables of the second line match those of the fourth line, usually with an exact rhyme at the end.<ref group=\"note\">The assonances follow the standard [[Wikipedia:Received Pronuncuation|Received Pronuncuation]] of England. Pairs including \"f'''a'''r\"/\"l'''a'''st\", \"p'''a'''ths\"/\"T'''a'''rmenel\", \"bey'''o'''nd\"/\"str'''o'''ng\", \"'''a'''rrows\"/\"dr'''a'''gon\", \"ag'''ai'''n\"/\"aw'''ay'''\" and \"s'''a'''w\"/\"sh'''or'''e\" have the same vowels in RP but not in many American and Canadian pronunciations.</ref>\n\nAn example where the vowels don't match exactly is \"across\" and \"passed\", though the sounds are similar and the \"s\" is repeated.  The first four lines are especially atypical.\n\n==Poem excerpts==\n===First stanza===\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\n[[Eärendil]] was a [[mariners|mariner]]\nthat tarried in [[Arvernien]];\nhe built a [[Vingilot|boat of timber]] felled\nin [[Nimbrethil]] to journey in;\nher sails he wove of [[silver]] fair,\nof silver were her lanterns made,\nher prow he fashioned like a [[swans|swan]],\nand light upon her banners laid.</poem>\n\n===Second stanza===\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nIn panoply of ancient kings,\nin chainéd [[rings]] he armoured him;\nhis shining shield was scored with [[runes]]\nto ward all wounds and harm from him;\nhis bow was made of dragon-horn,\nhis arrows shorn of ebony,\nof silver was his habergeon,\nhis scabbard of chalcedony;\nhis sword of steel was valiant,\nof [[adamant]] his helmet tall,\nan eagle-plume upon his crest,\nupon his breast an [[emerald]].</poem>\n\n===Last stanza===\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nAnd over [[Middle-earth]] he passed\nand heard at last the weeping sore\nof women and of elven-maids\nin [[Elder Days]], in years of yore.\nBut on him mighty doom was laid,\ntill [[Moon]] should fade, an orbéd [[star]]\nto pass, and tarry never more\non [[Hither Shores]] where [[mortals]] are;\nfor ever still a herald on\non errand that should never rest\nto bear his shining lamp afar,\nthe [[Flammifer]] of [[Westernesse]].</poem>\n\n==Inspiration==\n''Eärendil'' derives from Tolkien's earlier poem ''[[Errantry]]'' (published [[1933]]). In the drafts of ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', ''Errantry'' evolved in stages, and reached its final published form after fifteen revisions.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. xxiii</ref> ''Errantry'' was eventually republished in ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]''. Both ''Errantry'' and ''Eärendil'' use a sound pattern of Tolkien's own invention: trisyllabic assonances or near-assonances.<ref name=\"l133\">{{L|133}}</ref><ref name=\"ABcomm\">{{AB|Comm}}</ref> This fact passed into the legendarium, as the Preface to ''The Adventures of Tom Bombadil'' says that Bilbo was probably proud of his metre and used it as a model for ''Earendil''.\n\n==Other versions of the Legendarium==\nAmong the various versions of the poem, there is one version which [[Christopher Tolkien]] believed that his father most likely intended for publication instead of the above version, which was published in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.<ref name=\"Final\" /><ref name=\"F\" />\n\nThe title ''Eärendillinwë'' (sometimes ''Earendillínwë'' with a long ''í'') is a title that appears in various drafts but not in the published text of the ''Fellowship''.<ref name=\"F\" /> The spelling ''Earend'''e'''l'' belongs to earlier versions of the Legendarium, as when the character first appears in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Errantry]]''\n*[[Fragment of an alliterative Lay of Eärendel]]\n*''[[Lay of Eärendil]]''\n*[[Poems in The Lord of the Rings|Poems in ''The Lord of the Rings'']]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.councilofelrond.com/poem/the-short-lay-of-earendel-earendillinwe/ Eärendillinwë], the latest form of the Song of Eärendil, which was not published in ''Fellowship''\n\n{{references|n}}\n\n[[Category:Poems in The Fellowship of the Ring]]\n\n[[de:Lied über Earendil]]\n[[fi:Eärendil, kyntäjä merien]]"}}}
