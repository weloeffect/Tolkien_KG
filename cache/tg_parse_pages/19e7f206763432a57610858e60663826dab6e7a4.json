Tolkien]]. \n\n==Overview==\nIn ''The Shaping of Middle-earth'' the gradual transition from the \"primitive\" [[legendarium|legendaria]] of ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' to what would become ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' is described, and it contains a text which could be seen as the first \"Silmarillion\" - the \"Sketch of the Mythology\".\n\nThree other parts are the ''Ambarkanta'' or \"Shape of the World\", a collection of maps and diagrams of the world described by Tolkien; and the Annals of [[Valinor]] and [[Beleriand]], chronological works which started out as timelines but gradually turned into full narratives.\n\n==Contents==\n* Preface\n\n* I. \"[[Prose Fragments Following the Lost Tales]]\" — brief, uncompleted texts which continue on from ''The Book of Lost Tales''\n\n* II. \"[[The Earliest 'Silmarillion']]\" — or, the \"Sketch of the Mythology\", this is the start of the ''Silmarillion'' proper\n\n* III. \"[[The Quenta]]\" — ''Quenta Noldorinwa'', a further developed version of that which appears in the \"Sketch\"\n** Appendix 1: Ælfwine's translation of the ''Quenta'' into Old English\n** Appendix 2: [[The Horns of Ylmir]]\n\n* IV. \"[[The First 'Silmarillion' Map]]\" — a reproduction of the first map of Beleriand\n\n* V. \"[[The Ambarkanta]]\" — cosmological essays, maps, and diagrams\n\n* VI. \"[[The Earliest Annals of Valinor|The Earliest ''Annals of Valinor'']]\"\n** Appendix: Ælfwine's translation of the ''Annals of Valinor'' into Old English\n\n* VII. \"[[The Earliest Annals of Beleriand|The Earliest ''Annals of Beleriand'']]\"\n** Second version of the earliest ''Annals''\n** Appendix: Ælfwine's translation of the ''Annals of Beleriand'' into Old English\n\n* Index\n\nThe ''Annals of Valinor'' and ''Annals of Beleriand'' show the earliest outline of the chronology of the [[First Age]] as envisaged in the early 1930s. The next volume in the series, ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]'' (1987), outlined revisions to both texts made c. 1937 as \"The Later Annals of Valinor\" and \"The Later Annals of Beleriand\".\n\n==Inscriptions==\nThere is an inscription in the [[Tengwar]] characters in the first pages of every ''History of Middle-earth'' volume, written by Christopher Tolkien and describing the contents of the book. The inscription in Book IV reads:\n\n:\"''Herein are the Quenta Noldorinwa, the History of the Gnomes, the Ambarkanta or Shape of the World by [[Rúmil (elf of Tirion)|Rúmil]], the Annals of Valinor, and the Annals of Beleriand by [[Pengolod]], the Wise of Gondolin with maps of the world in the Elder Days and translations made by [[Ælfwine|Ælfwine the Mariner]] of England into the tongue of his own land.''\"\n\n==From the publisher==\n{{blockquote|The fourth volume that contains the early myths and legends which led to the writing of Tolkien’s epic tale of war, The Silmarillion.<br>\nIn this book, the shaping of the chronological and geographical structure of the legends of Middle-earth and Valinor is spread before us.<br>\nWe are introduced to the hitherto unknown [[Ambarkanta]] or 'Shape of the World', the only account ever given of the nature of the imagined [[Eä|Universe]], accompanied by maps and diagrams of the world before and after the cataclysms of The War of the Gods and the [[Downfall of Númenor]]. The first map of [[Beleriand]] is also reproduced and discussed.<br>\nIn [[The Earliest Annals of Valinor|The Annals of Valinor]] and [[The Earliest Annals of Beleriand|The Annals of Beleriand]] we are shown how the chronology of the [[First Age]] was moulded; and the tale is told of [[Ælfwine]], the Englishman who voyaged into the [[Aman|True West]] and came to [[Tol Eressëa]], the Lonely Isle, where he learned the ancient history of [[Elves]] and [[Men]].<br>\nAlso included are the original 'The Silmarillion' of 1926, and the Quenta Noldorinwa of 1930 - the only version of the myths and legends of the First Age that J.R.R. Tolkien completed to their end.}}\n\n==Publication history and gallery==\n;UK editions\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"125px\" heights=\"125px\">\nFile:Shaping of Middle-earth 1986.jpeg |1986 hardcover\nFile:Shaping of Middle-earth 1988.jpeg |1988 paperback\nFile:Shaping of Middle-earth 1986.jpeg |1991 hardcover\nFile:Shaping of Middle-earth 1989.jpeg |1993 paperback\nFile:The Shaping of Middle-earth (HC2002).jpeg |2002 & 2015 paperback\nFile:Shaping of Middle-earth 2010.png ‎|2010 hardcover\nFile:Shaping of Middle-earth 2024.jpeg ‎|2024 paperback\nFile:Shaping of Middle-earth hc 2024.jpg|2024 hardcover\n</gallery>\n* [[George Allen & Unwin]], hardcover ([[1986]]), pp.&nbsp;380.
