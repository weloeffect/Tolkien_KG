The Dwarves agree to pay him to smuggle them into [[Lake-town]] and get the weapons and supplies they need for reaching the [[Lonely Mountain]]. He takes them in to his home until they plan to leave. When he learns of Thorin's true identity, he becomes worried about the Dwarves' quest, believing the [[Smaug|Dragon]] will destroy everything in its path if awakened.

He is also revealed to be a widower.\n\n:Known by the [[Master of Lake-town]] (and his right hand man [[Alfrid]]) to be the descendant of [[Girion]], the last [[lord of Dale]], and fearing he may be trying to undermine their authority, Bard is under constant surveillance by various spies. He is ultimately arrested at the Master's behest on some vague charge and imprisoned at the end of the film.\n\n'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''\n:Bard escapes from his prison cell during [[Smaug]]'s destruction of Lake-town and attempts to take down the [[Fire-drakes|fire-drake]]. Bain manages to find him and get him the last [[black arrow]], which allows him to finally take down the [[Dragons|Dragon]]. He becomes a hero among the town's survivors and leads them in taking refuge in the remains of [[Dale]]. When [[Thranduil]] arrives with an army of [[Elves]] to attack the mountain, Bard attempts to peacefully come to terms with Thorin. He asks him for a portion of the treasure which Thorin had promised to the people of Lake-town, but Thorin refuses to give them anything while Thranduil's army remains. After this, Bard reluctantly joins Thranduil in his attack. However, the arrival of an [[Orcs|Orc]] army leads all involved to refocus their attention and battle the Orcs instead.\n\n{{references}}\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n| race=northmen\n| name=Bard I\n| died={{TA|2977}}\n}}\n{{seq\n| prow=\n| pvac=None\n| prev=Position established\n| list=1st [[King of Dale]]\n| dates={{TA|2944}} - {{TA|2977|n}}\n| next=[[Bain]]\n| nvac=\n| nrow=\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n\n{{hobbitfilms}}\n[[Category:Bardings]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Hobbit]]\n[[Category:Germanic names]]\n[[Category:Kings of Dale]]\n[[Category:Lake-men]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[de:Bard I.]]\n[[fi:Bard Jousimies]]\n[[fr:encyclo:personnages:hommes:3a:hommes du nord:daliens:bard]]"}}}
