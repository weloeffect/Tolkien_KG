The hills and the scrub-land connecting to the [[Dale]]-lands are also known collectively as the \"Ironfold\". Settled by \"Farin Blackmattock\" in the First Age, the capital \"Járnfast\" was destroyed by the fall of [[Thangorodrim]] and afterwards rebuilt. During the time it features in the game, Járnfast has been damaged by tremors caused by [[Mount Doom]]'s recent eruption. It is also the site of a seal that confines a horde of [[nameless things]] in \"The Howling Pit\" below.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dwarves of the Iron Hills]]\n*[[Lord of the Iron Hills]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Dwarven realms]]\n[[Category:Hills]]\n[[Category:Mountain ranges]]\n[[Category:Rhovanion]]"}}}
