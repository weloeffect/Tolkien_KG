She would water the flowers of Vána with dew gathered from the golden tree [[Laurelin]].<ref name=\"LR\">{{LR|Quenta}}, pp. 264-5</ref>\n\nAfter the destruction of the Two Trees of Valinor by [[Morgoth|Melkor]], [[Laurelin]] managed to produce one last golden fruit before it died away. [[Aulë]] crafted a vessel to hold the golden fruit. Arien was chosen by the [[Valar]] to guide the vessel of the [[Sun]] above the airs of [[Arda]] to give light to the World; [[Tilion]], another Maia and one of Oromë's hunters, was chosen to steer the [[Moon]]. The Moon had already traversed the sky seven times before the Sun was finally ready. The first dawn of the Sun was like a great fire glowing upon the towers of the [[Pelóri Mountains]] of [[Aman]]. [[Morgoth]] was dismayed, and he descended into the uttermost pit of [[Angband]] and his servants withdrew. He sent up dark clouds of smoke to conceal his land from the light of the Sun.<ref name=\"S11\">{{S|11}}</ref>\n\n[[Tilion]] loved Arien and followed her through the night sky. When he occasionally caught up to her, his vessel became singed by her heat.<ref name=\"S11\"/>\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Arien'' is [[Quenya]] for \"Maiden of Sun\".<ref name=Appendix>{{S|Appendix}}, entry ''arien''</ref> It is derived from the root ''as-'', seen also in ''[[Áre|árë]]'' (\"sunlight\"),<ref name=Appendix/> and ''-[[ien]]'' (feminine suffix).\n\nThe [[Adûnaic]] name ''[[Ûrî]]'' refers to \"The Lady of the Sun\".<ref>{{SD|3vi}}, p. 426</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\n=== The Book of Lost Tales ===\nIn the earliest writings, Arien's name was '''''Urwen''''' or '''''Urwendi''''', which translated in \"Maiden of the Sunship\". She was one of Vána's maidens who took care of the tree Laurelin; her task was to water it.<ref>{{LT1|III}}, p. 73</ref> When the [[Two Trees of Valinor]] were destroyed, she offered to steer the Ship of the Sun.<ref name=\"LT1Sun\">{{LT1|VIII}}, p. 118</ref>\n\nIt was told that Urwendi and her maidens, before the rising of the Sun, entered into [[Fôs' Almir|Fôs Almir]] (Faskalan), a bath of flame that would make one pure.<ref name=\"LT1Sun\"/>\n\n=== Later versions ===\nIn ''[[Myths Transformed]]'', which changed the timing of the Sun to have been primordial to Arda's inception, [[Melkor]] wanted to claim Arien as a wife,<ref name=Myths>{{MR|P5II}}</ref>{{rp|380–1}} but when she refused him, he attempted to ravish her.<ref name=Myths/>{{rp|405}} However, she released her spirit and burned Melkor leaving him ashen and grey. The Sun was then left without a guide and caused uneven seasons and periods of excessive heat or cold in [[Arda]].<ref name=Myths/>{{rp|381}} In an alternative version, Melkor assaulted her and tainted the light of the Sun, which caused Arien's (''Arie'' in this version) spirit to flee in anguish and wrath from the world. In other abandoned writings, she was a Maia of [[Varda]].<ref name=Myths>{{MR|P5II}}</ref>{{rp|380}}\n\n{{references}}\n{{ainur}}\n{{cosmology}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Maiar]]\n[[Category:Quenya names]]\n[[de:Arien]]\n[[fr:/encyclo/personnages/ainur/maiar/arien]]\n[[fi:Arien]]"}}}
