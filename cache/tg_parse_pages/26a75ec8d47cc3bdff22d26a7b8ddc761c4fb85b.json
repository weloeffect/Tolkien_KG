I watched from a distance as everybody else, enjoyed the premiere, and watched the characters being taken in by the fans and all that.  But then obviously when the second film came out that was very exciting because I got to see, as well as the rest of the world, Bard the Bowman come to life.  It's been really lovely watching and reading the positive reception around the world, and different fans all really enjoying Bard and liking his story and liking me playing him. So it's been a positive experience so far.|Luke Evans, Collider}}\n{{quote|He has three children and he’s forced into becoming a leader and he doesn’t really want to be a leader. I think he’s happy just looking after his family and just…he doesn’t want a war. His emotions are very human and I guess that will make him quite appealing to an audience.|Luke Evans about Bard, lordoftherings.net}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{WP|Luke Evans (actor)|Luke Evans}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Evans, Luke}}\n[[Category:Actors and actresses]]\n[[Category:British people]]\n[[Category:People by name]]\n[[Category:The Hobbit (film series) cast]]\n\n[[fi:Luke Evans]]"}}}
