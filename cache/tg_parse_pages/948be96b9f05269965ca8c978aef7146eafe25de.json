Then it speaks of Celegorm and [[Curufin]] with Huan hunting the [[wolves]] of [[Sauron|Thû]].  It tells of how Huan spotted [[Lúthien|Lúthien Tinúviel]] on her quest to rescue [[Beren]].  He captured her and brought her before Celegorm, where she, assuming that they were her friends, dropped her raiment of shadow and stood before them in her silver and white dress.  They offered her their help, but did not know that they were the reason that Beren and [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] had gone without more aid.  Curufin, who had fallen in love with her, brought her to [[Nargothrond]] and took her cloak so that she could not escape.  They did not intend to help her, but to let Felagund die in the prisons of Thû and them take over Nargothrond.  The people would not listen to [[Orodreth]], whom Felagund had appointed lord in his absence, and heeded not the fate of Felagund.  But Huan had developed a love for her, and bringing her her raiment of slumber spoke for the first time, and she escaped on his back."}}}
