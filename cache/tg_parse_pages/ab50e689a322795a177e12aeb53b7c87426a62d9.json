[[Melkor]] destroyed the Two Lamps, and where [[Illuin]] (the northern tower) had stood, the inland Sea of Helcar was formed. Many rivers flowed into the Sea of Helcar from the east. [[Cuiviénen]], where the first [[Elves]] [[Awakening of the Elves|awoke]], was a bay on the eastern side of the Sea of Helcar, and it lay under the shadows of the [[Orocarni]] (Red Mountains). During the [[Great Journey]], the Elves travelled north around the Sea of Helcar before turning westward.<ref name=S /> After this, the Sea of Helcar passed out of history.\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn the ''[[Ambarkanta]]'', the Sea of Helcar was depicted as an enormous body of water that stretched from the Red Mountains in the east to the [[Blue Mountains]] in the west.<ref>{{SM|A4}}</ref> After Middle-earth's landscape changed in the [[Battle of the Powers]], the western end of the Sea was depicted as being separated from the [[Great Gulf]] only by a narrow strip of mountainous land called the [[Straits of the World]].<ref>{{SM|A5}}</ref> However, these early depictions predate Tolkien's conception of the wide lands of [[Eriador]], [[Gondor]], and [[Mordor]] that lay east of the Great Gulf.\n\nChristopher Tolkien questioned whether or not the [[Sea of Rhûn]] could \"...be identified with the Sea of Helkar, vastly shrunken\".<ref>{{WJ|Men}} p. 174</ref> In ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'', [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] assumed that Mordor, [[Khand]], and parts of [[Rhûn]] in the Second and Third Ages lay where the Sea of Helcar had been in the First Age, and that the Sea of Rhûn and [[Sea of Núrnen]] were its remnants. However, in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'' (which was published after Fontstad's ''Atlas''), there are references to the Sea of Rhûn and its surrounding geographical landmarks existing as far back as the [[Years of the Trees]] at the time of the [[Great Journey]],<ref>{{PM|Last}} p. 391-392 (note 29)</ref> and [[Melkor]] was said to have created [[Mount Doom]] in Mordor during the \"long [[First Age]]\".<ref>{{PM|Last}} p. 390 (note 14)</ref> Additionally, it is told in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' that the migration of the [[Drúedain]] from [[Hildórien]] brought them westward through lands south of Mordor.<ref>{{UT|Druedain}}, pp. 339-340</ref> In ''[[The Nature of Middle-earth]]'', [[Cuiviénen]] (located on the eastern shores of the Sea of Helcar) is roughly at 200 miles from the Sea of Rhûn,<ref>{{NM|P1vii}} p. 47</ref> or in a more detailed annalistic text on the March of the Quendi [[Cuiviénen]] is at around 450 miles eastward from the Sea of Rhûn.<ref>{{NM|P1vii}} p. 49</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Sea of Ringil]]\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Eastern lands]]\n[[Category:Lakes]]\n[[Category:Rhûn]]\n[[Category:Seas and oceans]]\n[[de:Helcar]]\n[[fi:Helcar]]"}}}
