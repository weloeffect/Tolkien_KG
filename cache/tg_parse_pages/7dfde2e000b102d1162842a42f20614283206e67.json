"'''Vanyarin''',<ref>{{PE|19}}, pp. 88, 128</ref><ref>{{VT|42a}}, p. 26</ref> or '''Vanyarin Quenya''' and also sometimes called '''Quendya''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˈkʷeɲɟa]}}) is the dialect of [[Quenya]] as spoken by the [[Vanyar]] in [[Valimar]], as distinguished from the Noldorin/[[Exilic Quenya]]. \n\n==History==\nThe language Quenya evolved in [[Valinor]], but a separation could also be observed there among the [[Vanyar]] and the [[Noldor]], especially considering that the Vanyar decided to abandon [[Eldamar]] and come closer to the [[Valar]] while the Noldor stayed in closer contact with the [[Falmari]] and [[Telerin|their language]].\n\nThe speech of the Vanyar (being closest to the Valar), had many [[Valarin]] loanwords in their language.<ref name=\"P\"/> Furthermore, their dialect was more conservative than that of the Noldor who were more innovative. \n\nHowever, the Vanyarin loremasters would give their assent to changes introduced by the Noldor in order to be considered genuine Quenya in their common speech community.<ref name=\"V\">{{VT|41}}</ref> One of those changes was the consonant -r in plural words instead of -i, which the Vanyar adopted.<ref name=\"P\">{{WJ|quendi}}</ref>\n\nConcerning the parallel evolution of the two languages, we are told that [[Fëanor]] viewed the matter of the sound change of ''þ'' to ''s'' by his people as a personal insult to the memory of his mother who was called [[Míriel|Þerindë]], and resisted it.<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}</ref> On the other hand, the Vanyar also pronounced the sound ''f-'' very softly, threatening to merge it with ''hw-'', and Fëanor jested them that they would pronounce his name as ''Hwëanáro''.<ref name=\"V\"/>\n\nSince the Noldor came to [[Middle-earth]] and their language became known among the [[Sindar]], the [[Silvan Elves|Silvan]] and afterwards the [[Dúnedain]], Vanyarin was considered a less known, elusive dialect, spoken only in Valinor.\n\n==Variations==\nNot much is known about how distinct the speech of the Vanyar was from that of the Noldor other than some sound changes which occurred only to the latter. All in all however, the two dialects were virtually identical, with few differences of minor importance; at least before the [[Exile of the Noldor]].<ref>{{PE|19}}, p. 70 (footnote 14)</ref>\n\n===Pronunciation===\n;d: Seen in the title of the poem ''[[Aldudénië]]''; intermedial \"d\" does not exist in classical Quenya, which probably was not the case in Vanyarin.<ref>{{webcite|website=Arda|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/quen-eng.htm|articlename=Quettaparma Quenyallo}}</ref> \n;lb: Equivalent to Noldorin /lv/.  While (Noldorin) Quenya as we know it, does not allow /lb/, the word ''[[ulban]]'' (borrowed form Valarin), is associated with the Vanyar. Perhaps Vanyarin phonology did allow /lb/.\n;ndy: This is a particular sound change which we know occurred in the word ''Quenya'' while the Vanyar still pronounced this word ''Quendya'', without the simplification. Presumably other complex clusters simplified in everyday Quenya speech, were retained in Vanyarin.\n;f = ''almost'' hw: Fëanor noted that initial /f/ was so soft (bilabial {{IPA|[ɸ]}}) that it was often confused with /hw/ (labiovelar {{IPA|[ʍ]}}) to Noldorin ears. The Noldor opposed this tendency, helped by influence from the [[Telerin]] language, with which they had contact.  Whether the Vanyar ever actually did merge /hw/ with /f/ is unclear&mdash;it's possible they did not, considering that the equivilent voiced phonemes /w/ (labiovelar {{IPA|[w]}}) and /v/ (bilabial {{IPA|[β]}}) did not merge among the Vanyar.\n;þ (or th): Shortly before the [[Rebellion of the Noldor]], they had begun merging the sound /þ/ (dental {{IPA|[θ]}}) with the sound /s/ (alveolar {{IPA|[s]}}). The Vanyar retained that sound, as did [[Fëanor]] along with [[Sons of Fëanor|his sons]] for a time. V. Þerindë N. Serindë\n;z: Around that time, also the Noldor merged the sound /z/ with /r/. Again, it was something not occurring among the Vanyar. V. ázë N. árë\n;w: The Exiles (after the [[First Age]]) also simplified initial /w/ to /v/. The Vanyar most presumably kept that distinction. Whether [[Finarfin]]'s Noldor in [[Tirion]] also did this is unclear. V. wanwa N. vanwa\n;ñ: After the [[Second Age]] among the Exile, the Noldor simplified the initial sound of /ñ/ (velar {{IPA|[ŋ]}}) to /n/ (coronal {{IPA|[n]}}), but this is not mentioned about Vanyarin. Again, whether this occurred in Tirion is unclear. V. Ñoldo N. Noldo\n\n===Grammar===\nNothing is known about what differences Vanyarin had from Noldorin, other than it retained the final long vowel in accusative (Eldá, ciryá etc), a feature dropped by the Noldor.\n\nOriginally, [[Primitive Elvish]] formed the plural with the ending -î. The Noldor invented the ending -r for words that end in a vowel (Valai > Valar) something that the Vanyar adopted. In adjectives, the -i was assimilated in Noldorin (vanima > vanimë) but it is not known if the Vanyar followed this.\n===Vocabulary===\nQuenya borrowed some words from Valarin, like the names of the Valar and the names ''[[Máhanaxar]]'' and ''[[Ezellohar]]''. The Vanyar had this custom more frequently even in simple words. Some of them are the color words ''[[ulban]]'' (Q. ''[[luin]]''), ''[[ezello]]'' (Q. ''[[laiqua]]''), ''[[nasar]]'' (Q. ''[[carnë]]'') and ''[[tulka]]'' (Q. ''[[malina]]'').\n\nSome other known Quenya words are said to bear some influence from [[Sindarin]] which happened only to the Noldorin exiles. For example ''[[Orcs|orco]]'' derives from ''[[Orcs|urco]]'', but after influence from Sindarin ''[[orch]]''. Such words should be ruled out from the Vanyarin vocabulary.\n\n==Etymology==\n\n''Quendya'' is the archaic name of the word Quenya which Tolkien said was still used among the Vanyar, therefore they would refer to their language as such. Although it still would encompass the dialects of the Noldor and the Teleri.{{fact}}\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', the First Elves were called [[Lindar]] and their language was called [[Qenya]]. The other Elves spoke [[Old Noldorin]] (intead of Quenya) and [[Solosimpin]] (instead of Telerin).\n==See also==\n*[[Exilic Quenya]]\n==External links==\n*[http://www.science-and-fiction.org/elvish/vanyarin_quenya.html Vanyarin Quenya] article by [[Thorsten Renk]]\n\n{{references}}\n{{languages}}\n[[Category:Quenya]]\n[[Category:Quenya adjectives]]\n[[Category:Quenya nouns]]\n[[Category:Vanyar]]"}}}
