Swanfleet\" was the name of the lower part of the river, but it was pointed out as wrong by [[Christopher Tolkien]] (Swanfleet being the fens the river flows into) and it was corrected in later printings.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. xlvi</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nAfter the publication of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] mentioned in an essay about the names of rivers that the Glanduin was part of the southern border of the North Kingdom of [[Arnor]].<ref name=\"AppendixD\"/> This is in contradiction with the statement in Appendix A of ''The Lord of the Rings'' that says that Arnor did not include the lands east of the Greyflood and the Loudwater in which Rivendell and Eregion (Hollin) were located.<ref name=\"Eriador\"/>\n\n==Portrayals in adaptations==\n'''2008: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Glanduin river forms the border between the in-game regions of [[Eregion]] and [[Enedwaith]]. It flows past [[Ost-in-Edhil|Mirobel and Caras Gelebren]] and splits into several streams before joining with [[Mitheithel]] at the Wadewater of [[Swanfleet]].\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Eriador]]\n[[Category:Rivers]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[de:Glanduin]]\n[[fi:Glanduin]]"}}}
