This scene was extended in the latter edition.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Faramir]] and his [[Madril|second in command]] discuss the movement of [[Sauron]]'s and [[Saruman]]'s armies. They know [[Gondor]] is weak.\n\nFaramir has the blindfolds of [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] removed and speaks with them, saying his men tell him they are spies. Sam does not take kindly to this, and Frodo tells Faramir their names. Upon being asked about their ''\"[[Gollum|skulking friend]]\"'', Frodo claims that he and Sam are travelling alone. He then tells Faramir that the two of them left [[Rivendell]] with seven companions. \n{{blockquote|[[Gandalf|One]] we lost in Moria, two were my kin, [[Gimli|a Dwarf]] there was also, and [[Legolas|an Elf]]. And two Men, [[Aragorn]], son of [[Arathorn II|Arathorn]], and [[Boromir]] of Gondor.|Frodo}}\n\nSomewhat surprised by this, Faramir tells them that Boromir is dead, much to the shock of Frodo. \n{{blockquote|His horn washed up on the riverbank, about six days past. It was cloven in two. But more than this, I know it in my heart. He was my brother.|[[Faramir]]}}\n\nA flashback is shown of Faramir standing by a river bank as the funeral boat containing the body of Boromir floats towards him. The scene ends with Faramir sitting alone, holding the cloven [[Horn of Gondor]], deep in thought. \n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers scenes|40]]"}}}
