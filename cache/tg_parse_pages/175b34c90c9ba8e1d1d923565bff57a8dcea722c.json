He worked for [[Barliman Butterbur]] at ''[[The Prancing Pony]]'' with [[Bob]], where he served food and tended to any other needs guests might have. \n\nOn [[29 September|September 29]], {{TA|3018}},<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> [[Travellers|four Shire-hobbits]] came to ''The Prancing Pony''.<ref name=\"Sign\" /> When one of them, [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]], went missing after a night stroll, Nob found him near the house of [[Bill Ferny]].<ref name=\"Strider\">{{FR|Strider}}</ref> Realizing the [[Nazgûl|danger]], Nob helped the Hobbits to disguise their beds, and kept watch at night.

Hammond]], [[Christina Scull]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', page 151</ref> It is also possible that ''Nob'' was a nickname of a person named Robert; Tolkien's review of M. Förster's ''Die Französierung des englischen Personennamenschatzes'' mentions the name ''Nob'' in one line with better known names as ''[[Hob Hayward|Hob]]'' and ''Rob''.<ref>[[J.R.R.
