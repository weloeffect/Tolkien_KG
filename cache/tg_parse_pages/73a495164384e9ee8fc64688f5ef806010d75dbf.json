The title was first given to both [[Beleg]] and [[Túrin]] by the leaderless [[Elves]] and [[Men]] who, upon finding themselves dispossessed through battles and defeats, came to [[Dor-Cúarthol]] seeking the Bow and Helm that were believed to have supposedly fallen during the many battles within [[Dimbar]].<ref name=\"Captains\"/>\n\nAfter the following of the Two Captains had become a great force, word had reached as far as [[Nargothrond]] of their success in hindering and resisting the forces of Angband. So much so that the [[King of Nargothrond]], [[Orodreth]] himself, sent messengers to the Two Captains, offering his aid in any matter that they should have any need in other than in arms. Yet, despite this, he not only forbade the Two Captains from setting foot in Nargothrond, but charged them that they may not drive [[Orcs]] to do so either.<ref name=\"Captains\"/><ref group=note>However, it is very likely a potential possibility that Orodreth must have presumably had revoked this statement eventually, as he potentially never would have allowed Túrin to gain admittance into Nargothrond, let alone allow him become his chief councilor, otherwise.</ref>\n\n{{References|Notes}}\n[[Category:Titles]]"}}}
