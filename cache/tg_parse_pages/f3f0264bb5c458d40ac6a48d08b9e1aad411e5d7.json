Astrid was invented for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'' by [[Amazon Studios]], where she was portrayed by [[Jane Montgomery Griffiths]].<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10582302/fullcredits|articlename=Full Cast & Crew|dated=|website=IMDb|accessed=15 October 2022}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAstrid was from the [[Mordor|Southlands]] of [[Middle-earth]], though her home was attacked by [[Orcs]], and she had to flee with a group of companions. Along with [[Halbrand]], [[Eamon (The Rings of Power)|Eamon]], [[Abigail]], [[Doble]], and two other castaways, Astrid was eventually stranded in the midst of the [[Sundering Seas]] after their ship was destroyed by a [[Nameless things|nameless thing]] known only as \"the worm\".\n\nAfter two weeks at sea, Abigail, spotted [[Galadriel]] swimming near their ship. Believing her to be a fellow [[Men|Woman]], Abigail took pity on Galadriel and helped her onto the wreckage, giving her drinking water. At that very moment, Astrid pointed out that a ship was approaching, though she realized that it was the wreckage of their own ship being dragged along by the worm. In the ensuing attack, all except Galadriel and Halbrand were lost at sea or killed by the worm.\n\n{{References}}\n\n{{Title}}\n\n[[Category:Men from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) characters]]"}}}
