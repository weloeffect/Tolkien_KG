According to the early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', it was referred to as the '''Square of the Palace''', alternately called the '''Square of the King''', the '''King's Square''' and the '''Place of the King'''. Attached to it was the great court of King [[Turgon]].<ref>{{LT2|Index}}, entry \"Square of the Palace\"</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Square was the greatest of all the city, and there rose the [[Tower of the King]] being the tallest in the city, and the palace thereof was white and beautiful. There were fountains before the doors, and two trees, [[Glingal and Belthil|Glingol and Bansil]], of gold and silver. The fountains shot twenty-seven fathoms into the air, and white birds dwelt in the trees, singing beautiful songs.<ref name=Gondolin>{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|160}} In the northwest part was the [[Road of Arches]], which led to the [[Place of the Well]] nearby, while in the north was the beautiful [[Alley of Roses]].<ref name=Gondolin />{{rp|182–3}} In the south, the [[Road of Pomps]] went down to [[Gar Ainion]] and the [[Way of Running Waters]].<ref name=Gondolin />{{rp|186}}\n\nDuring the [[Fall of Gondolin]], the [[twelve houses of the Gondothlim]] suffered great losses, so at some point the surviving warriors gathered in the Square of the Palace. Then, first [[Tuor]] and [[Glorfindel]] cleansed the square, withdraw their men from the entrances and barricaded them.\n\nAfter [[Egalmoth]] came, the enemy's attack increased, with [[Orcs]] and [[Balrogs]] upon [[dragons]] trying to enter from every side. Egalmoth and Tuor went place to place to help in the defence, \"and that stand was the most stubborn-valiant that is remembered in all the songs or in any tale.\" A fire-drake got in from the north, but both lords confronted it, pushing it to the center of the square. [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog lord of Balrogs]] went ahead and beat down Egalmoth, but [[Ecthelion]], just recovered from his fainting, came between them. Stiking his helm into the Balrog's breast and twining his legs with the enemy's, both fell into the fountain of the king and perished.\n\nSeeing the enemy's hesitation, the [[Gondothlim]] attacked, and King [[Turgon]] and his [[House of the King|royal house]] helped to cleanse the square of enemies. However, a fire-drake was pushed to the fountain and its vapors covered all the square, while some warriors were killed by the heat.<ref name=Gondolin />{{rp|182–4}}\n\nThus was destroyed the fountain, and then there was a rally beneath the two trees. There the King proclaimed the fall of Gondolin and asked the survivors to leave the city. Leading them, later Tuor and [[Idril]] gazed the Square of the King being overran by Orcs that killed the remaining citizens and by dragons that beset the tower and burned the trees.<ref name=Gondolin />{{rp|184–6}}\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Gondolin]]\n[[Category:Locations in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Squares]]"}}}
