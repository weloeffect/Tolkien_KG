Tolkien]], drawing of Lake-town where the raft is moored to the shore south of the city</ref> of the mouth of the [[Forest River]] in a calm bay that was formed by the shelter of a rock promontory, which protected the town from the swirl of the Forest River. A long wooden bridge connected the town to the land. Guards were stationed in a hut at the landward head of the bridge. At the lake-ward end of the bridge the town was protected by gates.<ref name=\"Welcome\" /> The bridge to the land could be thrown down to protect the town.<ref name=\"Fire\" />\n\n[[File:Henning Janssen - Master above the Lake.jpg|thumb|left|''Master above the Lake'' by [[Henning Janssen]]]]\n\nLake-town had a market-place, wherein there was a round pool<ref name=\"Welcome\" /> that was connected to the lake by a waterway for boats;<ref name=\"Fire\" /> it was surrounded by wooden quays with steps and ladders that led down to the water. The greatest houses of Lake-town were around this market-place. They included the [[Great House]] where the [[Master of Lake-town]] held a feast.<ref name=\"Welcome\" /> The edge of the town was occupied with quays and, again, ramps, which descended to the water.<ref>The bridge and some ramps are visible in Tolkien's drawing.</ref><ref name=\"Fonstad\">{{HM|AME}}, The Hobbit - Lake-town</ref>\n\n==History==\nIt is not known when Lake-town was built. The name ''Esgaroth'' is mentioned on [[Thrór's Map]], and is said to be an older name, known while Smaug was younger.<ref>{{H|Inside}}</ref> When [[Bilbo Baggins]] came to the town, he noticed old pilings of a (possibly older) greater town along the shores when the waters sank in a drought.<ref name=\"Welcome\" /> It is possible that an original Esgaroth was destroyed sometime in the past, and the later Lake-town was its remnant.<ref name=\"Fonstad\" />\n\nLake-town was inhabited by the [[Lake-men]].<ref name=\"Barrels\" /><ref name=\"Gathering\">{{H|Gathering}}</ref> It is possible that some of them were the descendants of survivors from [[Dale]], like [[Bard|Bard the Bowman]], whose ancestor was its last lord, [[Girion]], whose wife and child had fled down the Running River.<ref name=\"Fire\" /> However as the years passed, Smaug was forgotten and children even doubted about his existence or the tales of older men who sometimes had seen him flying.<ref name=\"Welcome\" />\n\n[[File:Henning Janssen - Abusing Hospitality.jpg|thumb|left|''Abusing Hospitality'' by [[Henning Janssen]]]]\n\nIn the autumn<ref name=\"Barrels\" /> of {{TA|2941}},<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2941, p. 1089</ref> [[Thorin and Company]] escaped from [[Thranduil]]'s halls and [[Thorin]] followed by [[Fíli]], [[Kíli]] and Bilbo decided to enter the town and speak to the Master. The Dwarves were welcomed warmly because the Lake-men were eager to have the [[King under the Mountain]] return. The Dwarves and Bilbo were hosted, rested and pampered before being sent with boats to the ruins of Dale to confront the dragon.<ref name=\"Welcome\" />\n\n[[File:Lída Holubová - The Black Arrow.jpg|thumb|''The Black Arrow'' by [[:Category:Images by Lída Holubová|Lída Holubová]]]]\n\nSome days later, however, the town was attacked by [[Smaug]] and set on fire by his fiery breath, but [[Bard|Bard the Bowman]], who had indirectly learned of a weakness in Smaug's armour, slew the dragon with the [[Black Arrow]]. The town was wrecked by the dragon who had burnt it, fell dead on it and sunk in the lake. However, at least three quarters of its inhabitants escaped to the lakeshore with boats and camped there. The population was angry with the Master who had fled the town soon during the attack in his great gilded boat, praised the courage of Bard and his killing of the dragon and wanted to make Bard, who was descended from Girion, the king of the town. The Master replied that Girion had been lord of Dale, but not the king of Esgaroth and that the people of Lake-town had always elected masters from among the older and wiser among its population. The Master suggested that Bard should go back to his own kingdom in Dale and that those that wish could go with him. He also directed the anger of the population towards Thorin and his company by suggesting that they had woke the dragon who ruined the town and that they should demand compensation from them for the damage and a reward for the help that the population had given to them. Bard responded that this was no time for important plans of change and that he still served the Master, but would consider going north after a while with any who wanted to follow him. Bard sent messengers to king [[Thranduil]] to ask for aid. Thranduil sent ahead supplies by water down the Forest river and marched to them with an army of Elves. Many Elves helped to build huts for the people of Lake-town on the shore as a protection against the coming winter. Then the armed men of Lake-town and an army of Elves marched to the Lonely Mountain.<ref name=\"Fire\" />\n\nBard told Thorin that he still served the Master of Lake-town and that Smaug had destroyed Lake-town and asked Thorin whether he had no thought about the misery and the sorrow of the people of Lake-town. However, Thorin refused to negotiate under the threat of an armed force at his gate and said that he would consider them as foes an thieves as long as an armed force stayed in front of his gate.<ref name=\"Gathering\" /> When an army of [[Dwarves]] from the [[Iron Hills]] arrived and Bard refused to allow them to go to the mountain, the dwarves started to attack and arrows flew, but [[Gandalf]] stopped the opponents and told them that [[Orcs]] and [[Wargs]] were coming. As a consequence, the Dwarves allied with the Men and the Elves against the Orcs and Wargs and the [[Battle of Five Armies]] began.<ref>{{H|Burst}}</ref>\n\nAfter the battle, some of the population of the Long Lake followed Bard to rebuild and resettle the town of Dale. Bard gave much gold to the Master of Lake-town to help the people of the ruined Lake-town, but the Master ran away with most of the gold and starved to death in the [[Waste]].<ref name=\"Stage\">{{H|Stage}}, end of the chapter</ref> Lake-town was rebuilt to the north of its original location,<ref name=\"Stage\" /> because the population feared to go near the dead body of the dragon in the water at the original location.<ref>{{H|Fire}}, last page</ref> The new Master was wiser and very popular, because he got most of the credit for the prosperity due to trade up and down the River Running.<ref name=\"Stage\" />\n\nBy the time of the [[War of the Ring]], the kingdom of Dale under King [[Brand]] reached far to the south and east of Lake-town,<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}, p. 229</ref> but it is not known whether Lake-town remained independent or if it became a part of the kingdom of Dale.\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Esgaroth.mp3|Ardamir}}\nThe name ''Esgaroth'' was seemingly not given a clear etymology in any of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s later writings. A manuscript written after ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' states that ''Esgaroth'' was \"not ''Sindarin'' (though perhaps [[Sindarized]] in shape)\" or was \"not recorded in ''Sindarin''\", similarly to the name ''[[Galion#Etymoloy|Galion]]''.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 54</ref>\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien mentioned in a [[Letter to G.E. Selby (14 December 1937)|letter]] that he wrote on 14 december 1937 shortly after the publication of [[The Hobbit]] that ''Esgaroth'', ''[[Elrond]]'' and ''[[Gondolin]]'' have escaped out of his own mythology with its consistent nomenclature and organized history.<ref>[[Letter to G.E. Selby (14 December 1937)]]</ref>\n\nIn earlier manuscripts from up to the end of 1937 and the beginning of 1938 with additional entries up to 1940 or 1941,<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, introduction</ref> at least two meanings and etymologies of the name ''Esgaroth'' appeared:\n#\"Reedlake\" followed by \", because of reed-banks in west\", deriving from the [[Ilkorin|Ilkorin Elvish]] word ''[[esgar]]'' meaning \"reed-bed\".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 356, entry \"[[ESEK]]\"</ref>\n#\"[?][[Uncommon words#S|strand]]-[[Uncommon words#cite ref-LT2 0-0|burg]]\" from ''esgar'' \"shore\" (not given any designated language, but published in a hastily written entry for the Elvish root SKAR2).<ref>{{VT|46a}}, p. 14</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn a late draft of what would later become the chapter [[Many Meetings]], it is mentioned that \"Esgaroth, and much land to the south of the great falls\" were a part of the realm of King Brand.<ref>{{RS|Rivendell}}, p. 213</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''\n[[File:The Hobbit - The Desolation of Smaug - Lake-town.jpg|thumb|Lake-town in ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit film trilogy]]'']]\n:Lake-town is portrayed much larger than in Tolkien's illustrations, not built on a single square ramp, and having many 'blocks' and canals. It is run by a heavily corrupt Master, aided by [[Alfrid]]. While the other Dwarves set out for Erebor, [[Kíli]], [[Fíli]], [[Dori]] and [[Óin]] stay behind with [[Bard]]'s children [[Bain]], [[Sigrid]] and [[Tilda]] to tend to Kíli's arrow wound. Orc raiders assail the town, but they are repelled by the Dwarves, [[Legolas]] and [[Tauriel]]. Tauriel heals Kíli with ''[[athelas]]''.\n\n'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''\n:The town is destroyed by Smaug, who attacks it as revenge for helping Bilbo and the Dwarves. The remaining Dwarves escape on a barge with Tauriel's help. Bard (with Bain's help) kills Smaug with a windlass. His falling corpse kills the Master and all on his barge.\n\n'''2018: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Lake-town.jpg|thumb|left|Lake-town in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n:The rebuilt Lake-town is a major travel point for adventurers in the North, situated further up the Lake from the old Lake-town. The watery ruins of Esgaroth-of-old (the former Lake-town) are still intact on the [[Long Lake]], with the Bones of [[Smaug]] resting on the remains. A band of brigands pilfer the location for valuables as well as Smaug's Bones.\n\n==External links==\n\n*[http://lingwe.blogspot.se/2012/08/esgaroth-whats-in-name.html Esgaroth — what’s in a name?] at [http://lingwe.blogspot.se/ Lingwë]\n\n{{References}}\n{{companyroute}}\n[[Category:Cities, towns and villages]]\n[[Category:Ilkorin locations]]\n[[Category:Rhovanion]]\n[[de:Esgaroth]]\n[[fi:Esgaroth]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/villes tours et forteresses/rhovanion/esgaroth]]"}}}
