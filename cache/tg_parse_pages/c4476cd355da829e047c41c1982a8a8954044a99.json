It appears in the chapter \"[[Treebeard (chapter)|Treebeard]]\". The initial cry was accompanied by a sound like the rolling beats and booms of solemn drums.\n\n==Text==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nWe come, we come with roll of drum: ta-runda runda runda rom!\n\nWe come, we come with horn and drum: ta-rūna rūna rūna rom!\n\nTo Isengard! Though Isengard be ringed and barred with doors of stone;\nThough Isengard be strong and hard, as cold as stone and bare as bone,\nWe go, we go, we go to war, to hew the stone and break the door;\nFor bole and bough are burning now, the furnace roars - we go to war!\nTo land of gloom with tramp of doom, with roll of drum, we come, we come;\nTo Isengard with doom we come!\nWith doom we come, with doom we come!\n</poem>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n\n'''1981: ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)]]'':'''\n:The Ent's Marching Song is performed by the Ents after they are roused to action by the news of Saruman's treachery. Merry (portrayed by Richard O'Callaghan) and Pippin (portrayed by John McAndrew) ask Treebeard (portrayed by Stephen Thorne) where they are going, to which Treebeard responds by telling the hobbits that they are heading to Isengard with the intent of \"splitting it into splinters, and cracking its walls to rubble\". This is in spite of it likely leading to their own demises. The singing of the ents is portrayed by the [[wikipedia:Ambrosian Singers|Ambrosian Singers]] composed by Stephen Oliver.\n\n'''2002: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''\n:The Ents begin singing the marching song while an infuriated Treebeard (portrayed by Leopold Haverl) leads a brief conversation with Pippin and Merry (portrayed by Robert Roth and Miroslav Noga) about the need to strike against Saruman, bringing retribution and \"judgement\" for his crimes against Fangorn and the surrounding world. (This dialogue includes Treebeard's famous line about there being no curse word strong enough in the tongues of Men, Elves or Ents for Saruman's evil-doing.) The singing of the ents is portrayed by a male choir of the [[wikipedia:Slovak Radio Symphonic Orchestra|Slovak Radio Symphonic Orchestra]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Poems in The Lord of the Rings|Poems in ''The Lord of the Rings'']]\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzegGJjPO4o Rendition from 2000s Slovak radio series] \n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLS2B4OQZww To Isengard music video] ([[1995]] metal song by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgana_Lefay Morgana Lefay] which includes the lyrics in the song)\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wS-uS9pmho The Ent's Marching Song] sung by [[Clamavi De Profundis]]\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Poems in The Two Towers]]\n[[Category:Battle cries]]"}}}
