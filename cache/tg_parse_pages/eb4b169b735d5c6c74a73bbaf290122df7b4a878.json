In the fragmentary legend of Georgius and his page [[Suovetaurilius]] (also known as Suet) there is mention of an outpost called [[Farthingho]] that was established to keep an eye on the neighboring [[Middle Kingdom]].<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'', Foreword</ref>\n\n==The Non-Sequel to the Story==\nAfter ''[[The Hobbit]]'' was published the company of [[Allen and Unwin]] wanted a sequel.  Before and during his writing of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] asked if they would publish ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]''.  The problem was that ''Farmer Giles'' was too short for a stand-alone book.  Tolkien offered to write another story set in the [[Little Kingdom]], about \"the adventures of Prince George (the farmer's son) and the fat boy [[Suovetaurilius]] (vulgarly Suet) and the Battle of Otmoor\"<ref>{{L|36}}</ref> which would add enough material for a book.  Eventually ''Farmer Giles'' would be published but Tolkien never wrote the sequel, which remained only a sketch.<ref>{{L|121}}</ref>\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Farmer Giles of Ham]]\n[[de:Georgius]]\n[[fi:Georgius]]"}}}
