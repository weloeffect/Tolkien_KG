The head landed in a [[Rabbits|rabbit]]-hole a hundred yards away.<ref name=\"Party\"/> Dismayed by his death, the orcs fled.<ref name=\"Concerning\">{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\nWith the rout of the orcs and the death of their king, their short uprisings within Eriador ceased, and eventually their attacks on the region stopped altogether.<ref name=\"Index\"/> The Shire, and Eriador as a whole, would not suffer from any more invasions until the [[War of the Ring]].<ref name=\"Scouring\"/>\n\nBandobras became a hero of Hobbit legend for his feat of arms, and was regarded in [[the Shire]] as one of the greatest Hobbits in history. To commemorate Golfimbul's head landing in the rabbit-hole, the hobbits invented the game of [[golf]].<ref name=\"Party\"/>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nIn the first phase of ''The Hobbit'', Golfimbul was called \"[[Fingolfin]]\" and the conflict was called \"’the '''Battle of the'''’ followed by a cancelled, illegible word of four or five letters that ended in -ll (possibly ‘Bull-’?)\".<ref name=bullroarer>{{HH|Pryftan}}, p. 12 (note 7)</ref> This was immediately changed to the '''battle of the Green Fields of Fellin''',<ref name=Pryftan>{{HH|Pryftan}}, pp. 8-9</ref> before swiftly changing ''Fellin'' to '''''Fao''''' which in turn was changed, likely at once, to '''''Merria''''' before the word was fully written.<ref name=bullroarer/> [[John D.
