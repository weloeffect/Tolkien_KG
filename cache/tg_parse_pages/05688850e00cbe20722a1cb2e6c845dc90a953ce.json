During his journey Aldarion explored the regions [[Lindon]] and [[Eriador]]. The ship is said to have had golden sails .\n\nAs they had returned from the journey Vëantur donated Númerrámar to Aldarion, who within three years from the first journey sailed again to Lindon and was three years abroad.\n\nSoon after that Aldarion made still another voyage, this time lasting four years, and evidently with Númerrámar even if it is not clearly stated, and explored the coasts of Middle-earth southwards all the way to the [[Bay of Belfalas]].<ref name=Wife>{{UT|Wife}}</ref>\n\nThe fourth journey of Aldarion with Númerrámar occurred after a somewhat longer pause, but the records of its durance and bearings are not told.
