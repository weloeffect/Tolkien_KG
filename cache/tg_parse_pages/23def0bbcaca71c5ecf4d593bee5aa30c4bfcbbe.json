Éothain scoffed at the idea that [[Hobbits]] even existed, believing them to be nothing but [[Holbytla|a child's tale]], and argued against the gift of horses to [[Three Hunters|the three companions]].<ref>{{TT|III2}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn one of the last drafts of [[The Riders of Rohan]], Éothain was Éomer's squire,<ref>{{TI|XX}}, p. 401</ref> whereas in a later draft of [[The Ride of the Rohirrim]], he was the captain of Éomer's household éored.<ref>{{WR|3|VII}}, p. 352</ref> No reference to Éothain's rank in Éomer's éored is made in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Éothain'' contains the [[Old English]] elements ''Éoh'' (\"warhorse\") and ''[[Thain|thegn]]'' (\"warrior, chieftain\"). It was a rendition of a [[Rohanese]] name that was never recorded, though the first element is likely translated from ''lô''/''loh'', \"war-horse\".\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Éothain in Adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Decipher - Éothain.jpg|Éothain from [[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Éothain.jpg|Éothain in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n'''[[1981]]: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''\n:[[John Livesey]] plays the part of Éothain.
