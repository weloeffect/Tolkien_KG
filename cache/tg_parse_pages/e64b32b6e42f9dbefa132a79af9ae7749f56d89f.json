As with all of the series it consisted of six characters in each of six ''[[Tyellë|tyeller]]'' or 'grades'.  This particular series took its name from the first of its signs, ''[[calma]]'' (literally meaning 'lamp', but here simply representing the character 'c' or 'k').\n\nThe Calmatéma was applied either to the third or fourth series of the Fëanorian writing system.  The [[Quenya]] language used the third series as the Calmatéma while [[Westron]]  used the fourth.  In either case half of the symbols in this series had one bow or ''[[lúva]]'' while the other half had two bows.  All bows in this series curved upwards and to the left from a stem, or ''[[telco]]'', which was either lowered, raised, or shortened.  If the Calmatéma was the third series all bows were open; if the Calmatéma was the fourth series all bows were closed with a bar across their opening.\n\nThe names of the letters in Tengwar were established in Quenya and had become standardised by the [[Third Age]].  The first four signs in the third series, the Calmatéma for Quenya, were ''[[calma]]'', ''[[anga]]'', ''[[harma]]'' and ''[[anca]]'', each represented a variant of the basic 'k' sound: 'k', 'g', 'ch' and 'gh', respectively.  The fifth sign, ''[[noldo]]'' (earlier ''ngoldo''), represented 'ng', while the sixth, ''[[anna]]'' was commonly used for consonantal  'y'.  In Westron, where the Calmatéma was the fourth series, the first four signs had the Quenya names ''[[quesse]]'', ''[[ungwe]]'', ''[[hwesta]]'' and ''[[unque]]'' although they represented the same 'k', 'g', 'ch' and 'gh' sounds.<ref>{{App|Letters}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Lettering]]"}}}
