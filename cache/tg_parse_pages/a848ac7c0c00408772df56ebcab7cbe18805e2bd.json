Tolkien''''' is an art book edited by [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]], published in [[2015]].\n\nThe work reproduces, with extensive commentary, some 190 illustrations (sketches, maps, tengwar and cirth specimina) by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] concerned with ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n\nAmong the illustrations 101 are previously unpublished, and 42 are published in colour for the first time.\n\n==From the publisher==\n{{blockquote|To celebrate the 60th Anniversary of the publication of The Lord of the Rings, a sumptuous full-colour art book containing the complete collection of almost 200 sketches, drawings, paintings and maps by J.R.R. Tolkien.\n\nAs he wrote The Lord of the Rings, J.R.R. Tolkien’s mental pictures often found expression in drawing, from rough sketches made within the manuscript to more finished illustrations. Only a few of these were meant for publication; most were aids to help Tolkien conceive his complex story and keep it consistent. Many do not illustrate the final text, but represent moments of creation, illuminating Tolkien’s process of writing and design. In addition to pictorial sketches, numerous maps follow the development of [[the Shire]] and the larger landscape of [[Middle-earth]], while inscriptions in runes and Elvish script, and ‘facsimile’ leaves from the burned and blood-stained [[Book of Mazarbul]], support Tolkien’s pose as an ‘editor’ or ‘translator’ of ancient records.\n\nThe Art of The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien collects these drawings, inscriptions, maps, and plans in one deluxe volume. More than 180 images are included, all of them printed in colour from high-quality scans and photographs, more than half not previously published. Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull, two of the world’s leading Tolkien scholars, have edited the book and provide an expert introduction and comments. Readers who have enjoyed The Art of The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien, with which the new book is uniform, will find much of interest also in The Art of The Lord of the Rings.}}\n\n==Publication history and gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"125px\" heights=\"125px\">\nFile:The art of the lord of the rings.jpg|2015 edition slipcase\nFile:The art of the lord of the rings 2023.jpg|2023 edition hardcover\n</gallery>\n*[[HarperCollins]] hardcover with slipcase ([[2015]]), pp.&nbsp;240.
