These Ruffians had been pouring into the Shire since late {{TA|3018|n}},<ref>{{RK|Homeward}}</ref> and were under the command of the [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins|Chief]], who himself was under the command of [[Sharkey]], who outlawed everything that the Hobbits held dear; food and inns most notably. It did not take long for [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]], [[Peregrin Took]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]] to violate several of ''[[The Rules]]'': \n{{blockquote|You're arrested for Gate-breaking, and Tearin up of Rules, and Assaulting Gatekeepers, and Tresspassing, and Sleeping in Shire-buildings without Leave, and Bribing Guards with Food.}}\n\nThe Travellers were arrested, but managed to talk themselves out of custody, and then subsequently rally the Hobbits to overthrow the Chief. A small group of Men was encountered, and Pippin declared the return of the King to them, and the message that emissaries were on their way. When he was scoffed at, he then declared himself the emissary, as he was not released from Elessar's service yet. The group was routed, but managed to get a message to a bigger contingent in [[Waymeet]].<ref name=\"Scouring\">{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>\n\n===Battle===\nAs twenty Men from [[Hobbiton]] marched towards Bywater, 200 [[Bucklanders]] answered the [[Horn-call of Buckland|call]] of Captain Merry's [[Horn of the Mark|horn]]. In Bywater, barricades were set up at the command of Merry. Meanwhile, the Cottons also joined the group. \n\nWhen Sharkey's Men came, they did not expect a trap. They walked up [[Bywater Road]], to the point where [[Tolman Cotton Senior|Farmer Cotton]] was standing. They threatened him, but found themselves heavily outnumbered, and as the hobbits closed the barricade behind them, also surrounded. Their leader fell by arrows as he tried to strike at Merry. The rest surrendered. \n\nA larger group of Men from [[Waymeet]] arrived the following day. In the meantime, Pippin had set up a rebellion in [[Tookland]], and returned with one hundred Tooks. Merry set up a defensive pocket on a heavily banked part of the Bywater Road. The Men walked straight into the pocket. Some surrendered, some escaped, and about twenty broke out. Six men and two hobbits were killed. The others now became desperate, and didn't care about escaping, only killing. The banks proved too steep to climb, and many fell before Hobbit axes. Merry and Pippin charged from the eastern bank, and Merry killed the leader.<ref name=\"Scouring\" />\n\n===Aftermath===\nIn the end, nearly seventy Men were killed and twelve were taken prisoner, while nineteen Hobbits died and about 30 were wounded. The dead Men were buried in a nearby sand-pit known later as the [[Battle Pit]]. The Hobbits were buried separately, and a stone was placed on their grave with a garden around it. A [[The Roll|Roll]] was made of the names of all the Hobbits who fought in the Battle of Bywater, with Captains Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took listed at the top. \n\n[[File:Matěj Čadil - Hobbiton Befouled.jpg|left|thumb|''Hobbiton Befouled'' by [[Matěj Čadil]] ]]\nAfter the victory at Bywater, the Hobbits marched on to [[Bag End]], where they found Sharkey, who was not simply a bigger ruffian as had been thought, but rather [[Saruman]]. Saruman was ordered away by Frodo, and Saruman revealed that his servant [[Gríma]] killed Lotho. Gríma cut Saruman's throat in a rage for years of oppression and abuse, but was himself shot by Hobbit archers. As the spirit of Saruman rose from its bodily form, it was blown away by a wind from the West.<ref name=\"Scouring\" />\n\nThe following year, preparations were made to restore the damage done by Saruman. Sam spread the blessed soil from the [[Sam's garden box|box of Galadriel]], and planted the [[mallorn]]-seed where once the [[Party Tree]] had stood. 1420, by Shire Reckoning, became one of the best harvest years ever.<ref>{{RK|Havens}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''\n:The Scouring of the Shire appeared in abridged form. The arrest by the Shirriffs is omitted, as is the second part of the battle and it takes place in Hobbiton rather than Bywater.\n\n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''\n:The Battle of Bywater is not featured in the film. However, the scouring of the Shire is referenced in the [[Mirror of Galadriel]] as a vision of a possible future. Hobbits are shown to be enslaved and the [[Ruffians]] are changed to [[Orcs]]; many areas are on fire and the [[Old Mill|New Mill]] is shown.\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Conflicts of the War of the Ring]]\n[[Category:History of the Shire]]\n[[de:Schlacht von Wasserau]]\n[[fi:Virranvarren Taistelu]]"}}}
