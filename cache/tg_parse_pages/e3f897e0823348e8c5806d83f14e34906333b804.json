The river [[Sirith]] joined it to the east, below the [[Warning beacons of Gondor|beacon]] of \"Sirthanc\". The village of \"Erynos\" stood across from the mouth of the Sirith, on the western bank of the juncture. South of the meeting of the rivers the combined river flowed south through the city of [[Pelargir]] and into the [[Anduin]]. The Celos was the domain of the lighthearted River-maid \"Silverfroth\", one of the Five Sisters, though she and her sisters were widely considered a myth by the time of the [[War of the Ring]].\n\n{{references|note}}\n[[Category:Gondor]]\n[[Category:Rivers]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n\n[[de:Celos]]\n[[fi:Celos]]"}}}
