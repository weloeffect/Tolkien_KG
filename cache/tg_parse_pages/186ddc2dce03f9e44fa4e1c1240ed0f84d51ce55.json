Tolkien]]'s novel ''[[The Hobbit]]'', published in [[2007]].\n\nIt contains Tolkien's unpublished drafts of the novel, with commentary by [[John D. Rateliff]]. It also details Tolkien's various revisions to ''The Hobbit'', including abandoned revisions for the unpublished third edition of the work, intended for 1960, as well as previously unpublished original maps and illustrations drawn by Tolkien himself.\n\nAn abbreviated version was published by [[HarperCollins]] in [[2015]] as '''''[[A Brief History of The Hobbit]]'''''.

It's rather along the lines of Christopher Tolkien's editions that make up the History of Middle-Earth series (which I highly recommend if you haven't read them): an edition of the original manuscript of The Hobbit with extensive commentary on how Mr. Baggins' story fits into Tolkien's legendarium. It's a big book filled with the entire text of Tolkien's first draft, along with short essays about everything from rings of invisibility or Tolkien's spiders to a detailed account of just when Tolkien wrote the book (which can actually be reconstructed from available evidence to within a month or two on either end).
