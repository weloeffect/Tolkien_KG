This scene was not featured in the theatrical release of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe scene begins with the [[Uruk-hai]] retreating from the [[Hornburg]], now defeated. The [[Rohirrim]] drives them away until they come to a forest, where [[Éomer]] shouts, \"Do not enter the forest! Keep away from the trees!\" The army halts, and [[Gandalf]] and the rest of the army watch as the Uruk-hai and [[Orcs]] head into the forest, where they hear the [[Huorns]] killing the retreating army of [[Goblins]]. The Rohirrim cheer as [[Saruman]]'s army is at last defeated and Gandalf smiles happily.\n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers scenes|61]]"}}}
