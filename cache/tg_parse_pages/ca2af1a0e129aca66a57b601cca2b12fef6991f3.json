They were known to have inhabited the caves deep within the hearts of mountains as far back as the [[Elder Days]].

After the two fell from the [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm]] into an underground lake, the [[Balrogs|Balrog]] fled through these tunnels. Gandalf pursued it closely, believing that its knowledge of the tunnels was his only hope of escape.

They have a variety of shapes, but most of them are humanoid, only with no eyes or no head at all. They can be found in the [[Drúadan Forest]], having come out of the [[White Mountains]] during the [[Dawnless Day]]; and beneath the [[Iron Hills]], where a horde of [[Morgoth]]'s monsters were sealed away by the Dwarves long ago. The largest concentration of Nameless, however, are within the Foundations of Stone, the deepest level of Moria.
