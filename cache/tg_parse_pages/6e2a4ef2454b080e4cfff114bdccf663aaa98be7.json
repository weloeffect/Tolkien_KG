Tolkien's use of proverbs within his Middle-earth legendarium, particularly focusing on The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, and, to a lesser extent, The Silmarillion. The book examines how these proverbial expressions enrich the narrative and provide insight into the diverse cultures inhabiting Middle-earth.\n\nThe book was first published on November 30, 2016, by Oloris Publishing. The paperback edition spans 314 pages and includes a foreword by [[Peter Kreeft]], a well-known author and professor of philosophy.\n\n==Contents and Themes==\nRowe's analysis highlights that Tolkien crafted unique proverbs for various races—Hobbits, Elves, Dwarves, and Men—to reflect their distinct worldviews and cultural values. For instance, Hobbit proverbs often convey practical wisdom with a touch of humour, embodying their straightforward and rustic lifestyle. In contrast, Elvish sayings tend to be more philosophical, mirroring their immortal nature and deep connection to the world's mysteries. By dissecting these expressions, Rowe illustrates how proverbs serve as a narrative device to deepen character development and immerse readers in Middle-earth's rich tapestry.\n\n==Reception==\nCritics and readers have lauded \"The Proverbs of Middle-earth\" for its insightful and accessible analysis. Jason Golomb from Fantasy Literature awarded the book five stars, stating that it is \"a smart, readable literary analysis\" and that passionate Tolkien fans will \"absolutely adore this book.\"<ref>{{Cite web|articleurl=https://fantasyliterature.com/reviews/the-proverbs-of-middle-earth/?utm_source=chatgpt.com|articlename=The Proverbs of Middle-Earth: The wise speak only of what they know|author=Jason Golomb|dated=2017-02-13|accessed=2025-03-14}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Proverbs of Middle-Earth}}\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]"}}}
