In its eastern part was the lone hill of [[Amon Rûdh]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref> \n\n==History==\nThe plain was guarded by rangers and hidden towers. When [[Sauron]] conquered [[Tol Sirion]], the [[West Beleriand]] was open to his forces. Although uninhabited, the plain was defended by scouts and spies of [[Nargothrond]],<ref>{{CH|6}}, p. 110</ref> the [[Haladin]] of [[Brethil]], and the [[Gaurwaith]]. Under the [[Two Captains]], the Gaurwaith controlled the area around Amon Rûdh, named [[Dor-Cúarthol]] after [[Gorthol|The Helm]] and [[Belthronding|The Bow]].\n\nAfter the capture of [[Túrin Turambar]], the plain was ravaged by [[Orc]] raiders and King [[Orodreth]] protected Nargothrond with ambushes, not wishing to draw Morgoth's attention to his hidden city. That was until Túrin, now known as [[Mormegil]], persuaded him to fight openly, and they managed to clear the Plain from Orcs. The Plain was lost after the [[Battle of Tumhalad]] and the [[fall of Nargothrond]].\n\nYears later, after his Orcs were defeated in [[Brethil]], [[Glaurung]] headed across the plain in a straight line, burning all in his way and poisoning the air.<ref>{{CH|16}}</ref>\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Beleriand]]\n[[Category:Fields, plains and deserts]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[de:Talath Dirnen]]\n[[fi:Talath Dirnen]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/regions/beleriand/talath dirnen]]"}}}
