The [[Edain]] had been offered the isle of [[Elenna]] and flourished there. While the [[Elves]] and the [[Dwarves]] retreated in their respective realms, outside them, \"Middle-earth went backward and light and wisdom faded\".<ref name=\"Ak\" /> According to the ''[[Tale of Years]]'', the dates that concern events in [[Middle-earth]], unlike [[Númenor]], are often uncertain.<ref>{{App|B}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Middle Men]] who did not heed the summons of the [[Valar]] and Morgoth fell back into a primitive state, having no contact with the [[Eldar]] or the [[Edain]]. Instead, some of the [[Easterlings (First Age)|evil Men]] who escaped the destruction of [[Beleriand]] came to the east and became their Kings. For this the Middle Men were neglected by the Valar.<ref name=\"Ak\" />\n\nIt was thanks to the [[Entwives]] that some Mannish folk learned agriculture, and these Men honoured them.<ref>{{TT|Treebeard}}</ref> The primitive [[Northmen]] of [[Rhovanion]] were defenceless against the remnants of Orcs, but they were provided with metal weapons by the [[Longbeards]], who made an [[Alliance of Dwarves and Men|Alliance]] with them.<ref name=\"pmrel\" />\n\nAround {{SA|600}} the [[Númenóreans]] sent ships to Middle-earth and established contact with the Middle Men and started teaching them agriculture, stonecraft and smithying. But it was around {{SA|882}} when King [[Gil-galad]] [[Gil-galad's letter|warned]] the Númenóreans that an evil power was taking shape in the [[East]].<ref>{{UT|Aldarion}}</ref><ref>{{App|Numenor}}</ref>\n[[File:John Howe - The Dark Tower 02.jpg|thumb|[[John Howe]] - The Dark Tower|left]]\nIndeed, [[Sauron]] was ever at work gathering [[Men of Darkness]] in the east and the south,<ref name=\"rings\">{{S|Rings}}</ref> some of whom had been of old corrupted by [[Morgoth]].<ref name=\"pmrel\" /> He established himself in [[Mordor]] around {{SA|1000}}, and he fortified the land with the [[Black Gate]] and the armies of Men whom he corrupted and enslaved. He also built [[Barad-dûr]] near [[Mount Doom]]. \n[[File:Abe Papakhian - Death of Celebrimbor.jpg|thumb|Abe Papakhian - ''Death of Celebrimbor'']]\nSauron attempted to corrupt the prosperous [[Elves]] of [[Eregion]], persuading them to create the [[Rings of Power]]. When the Elves rejected him, they fought [[War of the Elves and Sauron|a bloody conflict against him]], but Sauron destroyed [[Eregion]] and devastated much of [[Eriador]], pushing the Elves back to the [[Blue Mountains]], while the [[Dwarves]] retreated to [[Moria]]. \n==The Dark Years begin==\nWearing a fair and wise guise for the Men who worshipped him as \"Lord of the Earth\", Sauron now dominated most of the [[East]] and the [[South]], and even much of the [[Westlands]]. He gathered all the evil servants of his former master to him, and the [[Orcs]] greatly multiplied under him. Sauron ruled with force and fear, and it was during this time that he started to be known as the Dark Lord and the Enemy by those who saw his power spreading over the world. Not allowing any freedom or rivalry, he desired to destroy the [[Elves]] as well as Númenor. The Elves remembered those years as the \"Days of Flight\" due to Sauron hunting them, and they fled to [[Lindon]], where Sauron could not enter, and some even passed over the [[Sea]] to the [[Uttermost West]].<ref name=\"rings\" /> \n\nOther peoples retreated to the mountains or the woods, in fear.<ref name=\"rings\" /> Reinforced and commanded by his servants, the Orcs invaded the mountains of the [[Longbeards]] again. [[Gundabad]] was re-taken, the [[Grey Mountains]] infested and [[Moria]] lost contact with the [[Iron Hills]]. This also broke their Alliance with the Northmen, who also during those times had war against the Orcs and savage tribes of [[Easterlings]]. The war scattered them and the diminished numbers who remained there were impoverished, living in caves or on the borders of [[Greenwood]].<ref name=\"pmrel\">{{PM|Relations}}</ref>\n\nSome of the [[Men of the Mountains|Men of the]] [[White Mountains]] feared Sauron and started worshipping him.<ref>{{RK|Company}}</ref> Others of their folk migrated northward to the southern dales of the [[Misty Mountains]].<ref name=\"Men\">{{App|Men}}</ref> \n\nBut then the powerful Númenóreans responded to the Elves' plea and sent ships and armies to their support. The alliance, after heavy fighting, managed to reclaim Eriador and pushed the Dark Lord back to Mordor with a handful of Orcs.<ref name=\"rings\" />\n\nAlthough the war was ended, this was not the end of the Dark Days. Sauron directed his power over the far south and east conquering and dominating the savage tribes.<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref><ref>{{UT|Amroth}}</ref>\n===Shadow over Númenor===\nMeanwhile Númenor fell under the [[Shadow]] and the colonists started to oppress the primitive Men of the Westlands, demanding tribute of goods and wealth.<ref name=\"Ak\">{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> Some indigenous folk of Middle-earth were afraid of these [[Black Númenóreans]] and their ships who intended at some point to conquer the land of [[Agar]] and slay its people.<ref>{{PM|Elmar}}</ref>\n\nSauron turned his attention to the west once more, declaring himself \"King of Men\", starting against the Númenórean colonists and their ports. The arrogant Númenóreans, who were traditionally the \"Kings of Men\", saw him as their chief competitor, and once more came against him. King [[Ar-Pharazôn]] took Sauron as a captive to [[Númenor]], further corrupting the Númenóreans, who continued to enslave the primitive Men and even used them as human sacrifices. This corruption eventually resulted in the [[Downfall of Númenor]].<ref name=\"Ak\" />\n\nSauron's spirit escaped to Middle-earth, and returned to Mordor, where he slowly rebuilt his strength. Unable to assume a fair form, he started to rule through terror and force.\n\n==Fall of Sauron==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring - Last Alliance.jpg|left|thumb|Dúnedain attack in Peter Jackson's ''Fellowship of the Ring'']]\nThe [[Faithful]] who escaped founded [[Gondor]] and [[Arnor]] in Middle-earth and gathered Mannish peoples under them, including the [[Oathbreakers|Men of the Mountains]] who formerly worshipped Sauron. Sauron still considered the Númenóreans his most hated enemies and he launched a pre-emptive attack against them. The Númenóreans formed a [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|Last Alliance]] with the [[Elves of Lindon]] and fought Sauron in the [[War of the Last Alliance]], where finally Sauron perished.<ref name=\"rings\" />\n\nSauron's defeat ended the Dark Years and the Second Age, and allowed the Númenórean realms to flourish during the [[Third Age]].\n\n==Other names==\nOther names of this period were the '''Black Years''', '''Days of Flight''' for the Elves who fled to the Sea,<ref name=\"rings\" /> and '''Dark Days'''.<ref name=\"Foster\">{{HM|Guide}}, p. 82</ref>\n\nAt one point [[Aragorn]] mentions the '''Accursed Years''' to the [[Oathbreakers]], which [[Robert Foster]] identifies as another name of that period.<ref name=\"Foster\" /> On the other hand, the [[Encyclopedia of Arda]] considers it a \"''term of uncertain meaning''\", probably referring to the [[Third Age]] when the Oathbreakers were cursed to roam the [[White Mountains]].<ref>{{webcite|author=Mark Fisher|articleurl=http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/a/accursedyears.html|articlename=Accursed Years: The long years of Isildur's curse|dated=|website=EoA|accessed=19 May 2012}}</ref>\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''\n:Some of the Dark Years are seen during the [[Prologue: One Ring to Rule Them All...|Prologue]] to the film accompanied by [[Galadriel]]'s narration. After Sauron forged [[the One Ring]], his power is seen expanding over a map of the [[Westlands]], with flashback scenes of battles and peoples being ravaged and enslaved by [[Orcs]]. The Last Alliance is formed by the [[Free peoples]] as a direct response to Sauron's brutalities.\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Periods]]\n[[Category:Second Age]]\n[[de:Dunkle Jahre]]\n[[fi:Mustat Vuodet]]"}}}
