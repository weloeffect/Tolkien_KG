However, according to prophecy, [[Durin VII]] reclaimed his ancestral throne sometime after {{FoA|171}}.<ref group=\"note\">The mention of Durin's name as a prophecy in the [[Appendix A]], and considering that the Appendix derives from the [[Red Book]] (copied {{FoA|171}}), seems to suggest that he was probably born, or emerged, after that date.</ref>\n\n==List of Kings==\nWhile sixty or more kings might have ruled Khazad-dûm through the ages, only nine have been recorded:\n\n* [[Durin|Durin the Deathless]] - the founder and first King of Khazad-dûm in the [[Elder Days]].\n* [[Durin II]]\n* [[Durin III]] - who was a friend of the [[Elves of Eregion]] and was given the [[Ring of Thrór|first]] of the [[Seven Rings]] by [[Celebrimbor]]. He later sealed the [[Doors of Durin]] when [[Sauron]] destroyed [[Eregion]] in {{SA|1697}}.\n* [[Durin IV]]\n* [[Durin V]]\n* [[Durin VI]] - the king whose people delved too deep into the earth in their search for ''[[mithril]]'' and awoke a [[Durin's Bane|Balrog]]. He was killed shortly after its release in {{TA|1980}}.\n* [[Náin I]] - who was king for less than a year before he too was killed by the Balrog. Durin's folk then fled their ancestral home and Khazad-dûm became known as [[Moria]], the \"Black Pit\".\n**[[Balin]] led a [[Balin's folk|colony]] that attempted to retake Moria in {{TA|2989}}. Balin was a descendant of Durin, but not of the senior male line of descent, while the King of Durin's Folk was [[Dáin Ironfoot]]. As such, Balin ruled only as '''[[Lord of Moria]]''' for five years.\n* [[Durin VII]] - the king who returned to and refounded Khazad-dûm sometime after {{FoA|171}}.\n\n{{notes}}\n{{durinskings}}\n[[Category:Dwarven titles]]\n[[Category:Kings of Khazad-dûm| ]]"}}}
