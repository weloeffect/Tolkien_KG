All except the toughest of the people of Ithlien fled west over the river [[Anduin]], because Ithilien was plagued by invasions of [[Orcs]] from [[Mordor]]. Túrin II had secret refuges, such as [[Henneth Annûn]] built for his soldiers in Ithilien. The most important danger to Gondor was in its south, because the [[Haradrim]] had occupied [[South Gondor]] and there were many armed conflicts along the river [[Poros]].<ref name=TurinII>{{App|Stewards}}, entry for Steward Túrin II, p. 1054</ref>\n\n==Battle==\nIn {{TA|2885}} emissaries of [[Sauron]] stirred up the Haradrim who crossed the Poros invaded Ithilien<ref name=TA2885>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2885, p. 1088</ref> with a large army.<ref name=TurinII/> When King [[Folcwine]] of [[Rohan]] heard of the invasion he fulfilled the [[Oath of Eorl]]<ref name=TurinII/> and sent many men led by his sons Folcred and Fastred to help Túrin II.<ref name=Folcwine>{{App|Mark}}, entry for King Folcwine, p. 1069</ref>\n\nTúrin II defeated the Haradrim invaders with the help of the troops from Rohan in a battle at the [[Crossings of Poros]],<ref name=TurinII/> but Folcred and Fastred fell side by side in battle in Ithilien.<ref name=Folcwine/> \n\n==Aftermath==\nWhile Túrin achieved victory at the crossing of Poros, the Rohirrim suffered the loss of their two oldest princes. Folcred and Fastred were buried together high upon the shore of the river Poros according to the customs of their [[Rohirrim|people]] in a burial mound, which was called ''[[Haudh in Gwanûr]]''. The mound stood there for a long time and the enemies of Gondor were afraid to pass the mound.<ref name=TurinII/> As a consequence of the death of his two older brothers Folcred and Fastred, [[Fengel]], the third and youngest son of King Folcwine became heir to the throne of Rohan.<ref name=Fengel>{{App|Mark}}, entry for King Fengel, p. 1069</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''[[2012]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:A tapestry depicting Folcred and Fastred's last stand is found in Meduseld and can be acquired for use in player houses.\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Conflicts of the Third Age]]"}}}
