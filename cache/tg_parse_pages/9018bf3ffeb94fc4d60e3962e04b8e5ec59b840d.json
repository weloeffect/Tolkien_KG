Tolkien: Author of the Century]]''. Yet they are not the only contributions of his to Tolkien studies. Over the years, he has written and lectured widely on Tolkien-related topics. Unfortunately, many of his essays, though still topical, are no longer available. The current volume unites for the first time a selection of his older essays together with some new, as yet unpublished articles.}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.walking-tree.org/cormareBookInfo.php?number=11 Official product page]\n{{Cormarë}}\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Books by Tom Shippey]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]\n[[fi:Roots and Branches]]"}}}
