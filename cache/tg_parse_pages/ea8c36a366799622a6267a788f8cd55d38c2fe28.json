I looked at Ian’s (performance) more when I needed to. Again, I don’t really know how much I should say, but there were points where it was relevant for me to look very closely at Ian’s performance.|Martin Freeman, Weintraub}}\n{{quote|I think it definitely has an effect on him. Maybe I shouldn't say how much of it is negative or positive, but it's clear that it has a pull on him, that, I guess would be recognizable from The Lord of the Rings. But it takes a different turn, I guess. I suppose, 'cause The Hobbit anyway, is slightly lighter and it's more of a family affair, so it's not quite as dark. But it doesn't mean the stakes aren't there. It definitely still has to matter that he is in possession of this thing. And I think a lot of the time, even he doesn't realize why he wants to hold onto it so much, but there is an unspoken hold that it has on him, an unconscious hold.|Martin Freeman, Collider}}\n\n==Awards==\n* [[2013]] - '''[http://www.mtv.com/ MTV Movie Award]''', Best Hero, ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]''\n* 2013 - '''[http://www.empireonline.com/ Empire Award]''', Best Actor, ''The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey''\n\n==Bibliography, selected==\n===Articles===\n* [[2012]]: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey: Visual Companion]]''\n** \"Foreword\"\n{{references}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{WP|Martin Freeman}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Freeman, Martin}}\n[[Category:Actors and actresses]]\n[[Category:British people]]\n[[Category:People by name]]\n[[Category:The Hobbit (film series) cast]]\n\n[[de:Martin Freeman]]\n[[fi:Martin Freeman]]"}}}
