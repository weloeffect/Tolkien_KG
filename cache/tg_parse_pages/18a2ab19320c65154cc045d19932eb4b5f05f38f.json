Belegaer was narrower in the north than in the south, with its widest part near the equator of Arda. The continent of Aman, home of the [[Valar]], formed the western edge of Belegaer.  \n\nThe full extent of Belegaer after the [[Downfall of Númenor]] is never made clear, but it reached far enough to the north to be ice-covered, and far to the south.\n\n== History ==\nBefore the ruin of [[Beleriand]] at the end of the [[First Age]], the sea was narrow and ice-filled in the north, forming the strait of Helcaraxë, the Grinding Ice. It was thus possible to cross from Aman to Middle-earth on foot, though with difficulty, as did [[Fingolfin]] and his people of the [[Noldor]] when [[Exile of the Noldor|fleeing]] [[Valinor]].\n\nAfter the [[War of Wrath]], Belegaer was widened by the drowning of a large part of Middle-earth, (and possibly parts of Aman). The bridge of ice in the north was removed, removing land access to the western continent. During the [[Downfall of Númenor|Akallabêth]] in the Second Age, the seas were bent and the world was made round. Aman was removed from the world, Belegaer washed \"new lands\", and only the chosen could find the [[Straight Road]] to Valinor. The new western end of Belegaer is never described in the narrative, although there are indications that [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] refugees reached them in search for Valinor.[[File:Angelo Montanini - Belegaer.jpg|thumb|''Belegaer'' by [[Angelo Montanini]]]]\n\n== Islands ==\nBelegaer had several islands and island chains:\n*[[Tol Eressëa]], the Lonely Isle close to the shore of Aman\n*the Twilit Isles or [[Enchanted Isles]] seaward of Tol Eressëa\n*[[Númenor]] (Second Age only)\n*the Western Isles (after the First Age)\n**[[Tol Morwen]]\n**[[Tol Fuin]]\n**[[Himring]]\n*[[Isle of Balar|Balar]], in the Bay of Balar (First Age only)\n*[[Tolfalas]], in the Bay of Belfalas\n*[[Ened]], in the Firth of Drengist\n\n== Bays and inlets ==\nOther features of Belegaer:\n*Bay of [[Eldamar]]\n*[[Bay of Balar]] (First Age only)\n*the [[Great Gulf]] (First Age only)\n*[[Firth of Drengist]] (First Age only)\n*Ice Bay of [[Forochel]] (after First Age)\n*[[Gulf of Lune]] (after First Age)\n*[[Bay of Belfalas]] (after First Age)\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Belegaer.mp3|Ardamir}}\n''Belegaer'' is [[Sindarin]] for \"Great Sea\", from ''[[Beleg (word)|beleg]]''  (\"mighty\") + ''[[aer]]'' (\"sea\").<ref name=\"SilApp\">{{S|Appendix}}, entries ''beleg'', ''eär''</ref> The [[Quenya]] name of Belegaer, never used in primary writing, is '''''Alatairë'''''.<ref name=\"etym\">{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry \"[[AY]]\", see also \"[[AYA(R)]]\"</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nBelegaer is comparable to the real [[wikipedia:Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic Ocean]], which was once known to English cartographers as the Great Western Ocean.<ref>\"The English Atlantic, 1675–1740: An Exploration of Communication and Community\"  by Ian Kenneth Steele, Page 14</ref>\n\nThis is further reinforced by Henry Resnick quoting Tolkien as saying that \"''Middle-earth is Europe''\",<ref>[[Tolkien Journal]] II, 2 p. 1</ref> and [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] noting that \"''Belegaer was comparable to the Atlantic''\".<ref>[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]], ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'', p. 194</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[Category:Seas and oceans]]\n\n[[de:Belegaer]]\n[[fi:Belegaer]]\n[[fr:encyclo:geographie:eaux:belegaer]]"}}}
