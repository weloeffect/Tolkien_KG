To the northwest was the crossing over the river [[Ringló]]. The location is not mentioned in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nTarnost does not appear in the close-up map of Gondor in ''[[The Return of the King]]''.<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref> The first reference is in ''[[The War of the Ring]]'': On the western part of [[the Second Map of The Lord of the Rings]] there is a dot visible in square Q12 at the northern tip of the hills southeast of the crossings of the Ringló,<ref>{{WR|3|XIV}}, p. 434</ref> and [[Christopher Tolkien]] states that the map had penciled note calling it ''Tarnost''.<ref>{{WR|3|XIV}}, p. 437</ref> The second reference appears in ''[[Sauron Defeated]]'': In a manuscript Tolkien stated that \"From [[Erech]] a road ran by [the] sea, skirting in a loop the '''hills of Tarnost''', and so to [[Ethir Anduin]] and the [[Lebennin]]\".<ref>{{SD|Ir}}, pp. 15, 17</ref>\n\n[[Wayne G. Hammond|Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull|Scull]] suggest that ''Tarnost'' appears to be an earlier name for ''[[Ethring]]'', as they share a \"similar position on the published map\".<ref>{{HM|AoL}}, p. 139</ref> However, on the published [[Map of Rohan, Gondor, and Mordor]] Ethring is directly at the crossing over the river Ringló and directly at the road that runs from Erech to [[Pelargir]] instead of the foothills of the mountains of Belfalas, which are further to the south.\n\nTarnost appears on the map of the [[White Mountains]] in ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'', identified by [[Karen Wynn Fonstad|Wynn Fonstad]] as a city<!-- Is Fonstad the source for the notion of a city? (User:Morgan) --> in approximately the same location as on the Second Map of The Lord of the Rings. The nearby hills are also named as the Hills of Tarnost.<ref>[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]], ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'', \"The White Mountains\", p. 89 (1991 edition only)</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nIt has been suggested that ''Tarnost'' is a [[Noldorin]] name, the second element perhaps being ''[[ost]]'' (\"city\").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1420740361.html|articlename=N.
