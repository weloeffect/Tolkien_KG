The company of [[orcs of Isengard]] under his leadership killed [[Boromir]], captured [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] and attempted to bring them to [[Isengard]].\n\n==History==\nOn [[26 February]] {{TA|3019}} Uglúk was the leader of the [[Orcs|Orc-company]] that attacked the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] on the slopes of [[Amon Hen]], slew Boromir and carried off Merry and Pippin.<ref name=\"TA\">{{App|Great}}</ref>\n\nUglúk and his fellow Isengarders were servants of the [[Wizards|Wizard]] [[Saruman]], whom he called the Wise and respected him for his giving of man’s-flesh to eat.  However, not all of his company were from Isengard – the group contained a contingent of Orcs from [[Mordor]] led by [[Grishnákh]] and a party of Northerners from [[Moria]].  Uglúk's orders had been to kill all of the Fellowship except the Halflings, who were to be brought back to Isengard and Saruman alive, captured and unspoiled, as quickly as possible.  Grishnákh's orders were the same, except that his destination was to be Lugbúrz ([[Barad-dûr]]) and [[Sauron]].  The Northerners had no orders; they had come from the Mines for vengeance and killing, followed by a quick return to the north. [[File:Cor Blok - Uglúk.jpg|thumb|left|\"Uglúk\" by [[Cor Blok]]]]Not long after the capture of the hobbits these conflicting aims led to a brief fight in which some of the Mordor-orcs and Moria-orcs were slain.  Uglúk won and was able to impose his will; his Orc-company headed west while Grishnákh's group withdrew.<ref name=\"Uruk\">{{TT|III3}}</ref>\n [[File:Richard Sullivan - Ugluk.jpg|thumb|right| Richard Sullivan - ''Uglúk'']]\nOn the evening of [[26 February]]<ref name=\"TA\" /> Uglúk learned that a single horseman of [[Rohan]] had been spotted but had not been stopped.  Realizing that pursuit by the [[Rohirrim]] would swiftly follow he applied medicine on Merry's wound and forced drinks down both hobbits' throats. He then cut their leg bonds so that they could run with the company.  When the Northerners objected to his plan to keep on running by daylight Uglúk promised that they would run with him behind them, and he ran at the rear to keep an eye on all of his company.<ref name=\"Uruk\" />\n \nDespite the fast pace set by Uglúk on [[28 February]]<ref name=\"TA\" /> an [[Éored]] of mounted [[Men]] began to overtake the Orcs.  Near the [[Entwash]] most of the Northerners broke away and dashed off towards the [[Misty Mountains]].  At the same time Grishnákh returned with a couple of score of fellow Mordor-orcs. Due to the threat from the riders the two Orc-companies combined and headed for the forest.  As they sped along they caught up with the Northerners who perforce rejoined Uglúk's command.\n \nDespite all the speed they could muster the Orcs, now numbering two hundred, were surrounded just three furlongs from the eaves of the forest.  The hemmed-in Orcs began to grumble against Uglúk until he assured them that reinforcements led by an Orc named [[Mauhúr]] were close at hand.  As the night wore on the Riders made a sortie against the Orcs.  Uglúk led his Isengarders to stem the attack, which gave Grishnákh the opportunity to attempt to steal away with the two hobbits.<ref name=\"Uruk\" />\n \nGrishnákh was killed and the hobbits escaped just as Mauhúr tried but failed to break the encirclement.  Merry and Pippin fled into the woods as the Éored attacked at dawn on [[29 February]].<ref name=\"TA\" />  In the ensuing battle Uglúk almost broke through the Riders with a wedge of soldiers, but he was brought to bay at the very edge of the woods and slain by [[Éomer]] in a hand-to-hand sword fight.<ref name=\"Uruk\" />\n \nUglúk died not knowing that the two hobbits he had captured did not have [[the One Ring]].  As [[Gandalf]] later noted, Uglúk's efforts would unwittingly lead to the downfall of Saruman.<ref>{{TT|III5}}</ref>\n\n==Appearance==\nUglúk was a large black orc.<ref name=\"Uruk\" /> Being an Uruk, he was larger and stronger than the other Orcs and, presumably due to an exhaustive training.<ref name=\"Uruk\" />{{rp|449}}, he was not bothered by sunlight. Uglúk bore the symbol of the [[White Hand]] of [[Saruman]]. Like the other Isengard Uruk-hai, Uglúk carried a great bow and a short broad-bladed sword.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Pictures of adaptations of Uglúk===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy - Uglúk.jpg|''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''\nFile:Guardians of Middle-earth - Uglúk Icon.jpg|''[[Guardians of Middle-earth]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Uglúk.jpg|''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''\n:Uglúk was played by [[Brian Haines]].
