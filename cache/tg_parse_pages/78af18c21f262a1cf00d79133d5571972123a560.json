His treachery was uncovered by [[Jon Brackenbrook]], the son of the Captain of Archet. [[Captain Brackenbrook]] was unconvinced of Calder's betrayal because it was Calder who had previously imprisoned the former leader of the [[Blackwolds]], [[List of minor The Lord of the Rings Online characters in Bree-land#Otto the Brigand|Otto]]. [[Captain Brackenbrook]] was eventually convinced by [[List of minor The Lord of the Rings Online characters in Bree-land#Dirk Mudbrick|Dirk Mudbrick]], another soldier in Archet.<ref name=\"SOA\">{{VGC|SAIB}}</ref>\n\nCalder was imprisoned in Archet but escaped along with Otto in the Assault of Archet after killing his jailer [[Ned Pruner]]. Calder was killed at some point during the Assault .<ref name=\"SOA\" />\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cob, Calder}}\n[[Category:Men from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings Online characters]]"}}}
