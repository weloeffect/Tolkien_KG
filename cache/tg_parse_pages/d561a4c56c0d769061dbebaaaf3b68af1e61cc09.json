Pengolodh included it as an appendix to the ''[[Lhammas]]'' because of the implications of ''[[tengwesta]]'' (\"grammar, language\") on thought-transmission, i.e. with the development of language, telepathy became more difficult and all but fell out of use among the \"[[incarnate]]d\" (those beings with ''[[hröa]]'').\n\n==Real world history==\nThe essay was written in c. [[1959]]-[[1960|60]] by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] as a typescript of eight pages, separately paginated, numbered 1-8, and appended to the major work ''[[Quendi and Eldar]]''. The existence of this essay was revealed by Christopher Tolkien in [[Morgoth's Ring]],<ref>{{MR|P5X}}, p.415</ref> published in [[1993]]. It was published and edited by [[Carl F. Hostetter]] for the first time in {{VT|39}}. From the same editor, the essay was later included as a chapter of ''[[The Nature of Middle-earth]]'' ([[2021]]).<ref>{{NM|P2ix}}, pp. 205-216</ref> A related and short manuscript, \"Etymological Notes on the ''Ósanwe-kenta''\", was published in {{VT|41}}. This latest essay is mostly a list of linguistic roots. \n\n== External links ==\n* ''[https://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/langues_elfiques/quenya/osanwe-kenta Ósanwe-kenta]'' (available on the website of [[Tolkiendil (Tolkien society)|Tolkiendil]]) translated in french by [[Damien Bador|D.
