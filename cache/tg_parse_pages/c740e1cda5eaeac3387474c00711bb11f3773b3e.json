The ''Lefnui'' formed the western border of Gondor, because the [[Númenóreans]] had never established permanent settlements in the promontory of [[Andrast]] to its west where they only kept a coast-guard force and beacons at the end of the cape of Andrast.<ref name=\"Rivers\">{{VT|42a}}, entry '''''Levnui''''', p. 14</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe Lefnui played little part in history, though it was remembered by the people of Gondor and the [[Men]] of [[Rohan]].

These sea-going marauders landed at Lefnui's mouth on their mission to overrun and destroy the [[Rohirrim]], though they would eventually be defeated.<ref name=\"Eorl\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Lefnui'' (also spelt ''Levnui'') is a [[Sindarin]] name, which is said to mean \"fifth\". It received its name, because it was the fifth river south of the White Mountains in Gondor counting the rivers westwards from the [[Anduin]] after the rivers ''Erui'', ''Sirith'', ''Serni'' and ''Morthond''.<ref name=\"Rivers\"/>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn the \"working map\" that [[J.R.R.
