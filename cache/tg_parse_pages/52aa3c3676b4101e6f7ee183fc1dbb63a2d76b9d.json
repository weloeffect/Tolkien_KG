Tolkien Created a New Mythology''''' is a scholarly study of the [[Middle-earth]] created by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. The book is written by professor [[Tom Shippey]], first published in [[1982]]. It is one of the most highly regarded books in the Tolkien scholarship.\n\nThe book explores Tolkien's creativity and the sources of his inspiration, discusses the origins of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', shows how they contribute to Tolkien's mythology and how they can be appreciated.\n\nA second edition was published in [[1992]], to incorporate discussions on the ''[[History of Middle-earth]]'' series. And a third edition in [[2003]], to reflect on the new publications and new views on Tolkien studies.\n\nFour Tolkien's poems are included in the appendix, which first appeared in ''[[Songs for the Philologists]]'':\n* \"[[Bagme Bloma]]\"\n* \"[[Éadig Béo Þu!]]\"\n* \"[[Ides Ælfscýne]]\"\n* \"[[Ofer Wídne Gársecg]]\"\n\n==From the publisher==\n{{blockquote|A detailed and fascinating journey to the roots of The Lord of the Rings, by award-winning Tolkien expert Professor Tom Shippey.\n\nThe Road to Middle-Earth is a fascinating and accessible exploration of J.R.R.Tolkien's creativity and the sources of his inspiration. Tom Shippey shows in detail how Tolkien's professional background led him to write The Hobbit and how he created a work of timeless charm for millions of readers. He discusses the contribution of The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales to Tolkien's great myth-cycle, showing how Tolkien's more 'complex' works can be read enjoyably and seriously by readers of his earlier books, and goes on to examine the remarkable 12-volume History of Middle-earth by Tolkien's son and literary heir Christopher Tolkien, which traces the creative and technical processes through which Middle-earth evolved. The core of the book, however, concentrates on The Lord of the Rings as a linguistic and cultural map, as a twisted web of a story, and as a response to the inner meaning of myth and poetry.\n\nBy following the routes of Tolkien's own obsessions – the poetry of languages and myth – The Road to Middle-earth shows how Beowulf, The Lord of the Rings, Grimm's Fairy Tales, the Elder Edda and many other works form part of a live and continuing tradition of literature. It takes issue with many basic premises of orthodox criticism and offers a new approach to Tolkien, to fantasy, and to the importance of language in literature.}}\n\n==Contents==\n<div style=\"-moz-column-width: 400px; -webkit-column-width: 400px; column-width: 400px; -moz-column-gap: 15px; -webkit-column-gap: 15px; column-gap: 15px; -webkit-column-rule: 1px solid #cccccc; -moz-column-rule: 1px solid #cccccc; column-rule: 1px solid #cccccc;\">\n* Acknowledgements and Abbreviations\n* Preface to the Third Edition\n\n* Chapter 1. \"Lit. and Lang.\"\n** Old Antipathies\n** The Nature of Philology\n** Lost Romances\n** \"Asterisk-Reality\"\n** The wilderness of dragons, the shrewedness of apes\n\n* Chapter 2.
