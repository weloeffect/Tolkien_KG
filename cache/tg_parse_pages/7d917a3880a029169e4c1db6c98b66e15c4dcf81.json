[[Aragorn]] sits and sees a boy holding a sword nearby. He tells the boy to show him the sword. As Aragorn examines the sword, the boy tells him his name is [[Haleth (film character)|Haleth]], son of [[Háma]], and that the men are saying the coming battle is hopeless. Aragorn returns his sword to him and tells him that ''\"there is always hope\"''. \n\nAs Aragorn is readying himself for battle indoors, [[Legolas]] enters and apologies to him for [[The Glittering Caves|despairing at the situation earlier]]. Aragorn smiles and tells him there is nothing to forgive. As [[Gimli]] puts on his chainmail shirt, which is too long for him, he remarks that is it ''\"a little tight across the chest\"''. At that moment, they hear a horn sound. \n{{blockquote|That is no Orc horn.|[[Legolas]]}}\n\nAn Elven host led by [[Haldir]] enters [[Helm's Deep]] to the joy of the men of Rohan. [[Théoden]] meets them in surprise. Haldir tells them that the host was sent by [[Elrond]]. Aragorn and Legolas happily greet him as he tells them all that the Elves are ''\"happy to fight alongside Men once more\"''.\n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers scenes|48]]"}}}
