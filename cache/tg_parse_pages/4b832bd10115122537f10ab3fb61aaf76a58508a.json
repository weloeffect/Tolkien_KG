They had crude weapons and few horses for riding, because they mostly used horses to draw their large number of wagons.<ref name=\"Ride\" />\n\n==History==\nAround the time when [[Cirion]] became [[Steward of Gondor]] in {{TA|2489}} the Balchoth migrated from the East and drifted from beyond the Sea of Rhûn to the west. They killed the remnants of the [[Northmen]] that had still lived east of Mirkwood or drove them away up the River Running or into the forest of Mirkwood.<ref name=\"Ride\" />\n\nCirion was constantly concerned about the threat of an invasion from the east. He stationed a few men in the previously abandoned old [[Gondorian]] forts along the river [[Anduin]], especially on the western shore of the [[Undeeps]] in order to keep a watch there, and he sent scouts to the land between the forest of Mirkwood and the plain of [[Dagorlad]]. It was then that news of what happened to the Northmen reached [[Gondor]], but Cirion could not help them.<ref name=\"Ride\" /> \n\nThe Balchoth stayed in the lands between Mirkwood and River Running and often made raids through the forest of Mirkwood. As a consequence, the [[Vales of Anduin]] south of the [[Gladden River]] were largely deserted. The numbers of the Balchoth constantly increased with reinforcements from the [[East]] (in contrast, the Gondorian population of [[Calenardhon]], which was located west of the river Anduin, had decreased).<ref name=\"Cirion\" /> It is possible that [[Sauron]] influenced the Balchoth and the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] to invade Gondor.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}, entry for Steward Cirion, \"his enemies (or the power that moved them)\", p. 1053</ref>\n\nThe Balchoth mustered a large force all along the southern edge of Mirkwood. Cirion found out after the end of the winter in {{TA|2509}} and in March {{TA|2510}} riders were sent north to the [[Éothéod]] to ask for help against the invaders. [[Eorl]], the [[Lord of the Éothéod]], gathered an army <ref name=\"Ride\" /> and left that April.<ref>{{UT|8e}}, Note 30, It took the army of the Éothéod nine days to arrive in sight of the Undeeps on 15 April {{TA|2510}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile the Balchoth<ref name=\"Cirion\" /> had come from the north-east through the [[Brown Lands]]<ref name=\"Eorl\" /> and had built many boats and rafts on the eastern shore of Anduin, crossed the river and drove away the Gondorian defenders.<ref name=\"Cirion\" /> The northern army of Gondor<ref name=\"Eorl\" /> led by Cirion<ref name=\"Ride\" /> marched up from the south,<ref name=\"Cirion\" /> but the Balchoth defeated them in the [[Wold]], cut off from the south<ref name=\"Eorl\" /> and drove north over the river [[Limlight]].<ref name=\"Cirion\" /> There the Gondorian army was surprised by an attack from a host of Orcs from the Misty Mountains and was forced in the direction of Anduin.<ref name=\"Cirion\" /> \n\nSuddenly Eorl arrived from the north with a large host of cavalry of the [[Éothéod]] and attacked the enemy from the rear.<ref name=\"Eorl\" /> In the [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant]],<ref>{{TT|King}}, p. 512</ref> the land between the river [[Celebrant]] and the river Limlight, the enemies were driven south over the Limlight; after that the enemies in the Wold were also routed<ref name=\"Eorl\" /> and the cavalry of the Éotheod pursued and hunted down the fleeing Balchoth over the fields of Calenardhon.<ref name=\"Cirion\" />\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Balchoth'' was the name of those people given by the people of Gondor and consists of the [[Westron]] element ''[[balc]]'' (\"horrible\") and the [[Sindarin]] element ''[[hoth]]'' (\"horde\"). It was actually a generic term for disliked peoples, including the [[Orcs]].<ref>{{UT|8e}}, Note 24</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Images of Easterlings|Images of Easterlings]]\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Easterlings]]\n[[Category:Servants of Sauron]]\n[[Category:Sindarin demonyms]]\n[[de:Balchoth]]\n[[fi:Balchoth]]"}}}
