It appeared most prominently among the [[Dunlendings]], who gave it to their hated neighbours, the [[Rohirrim]], whom they saw as usurping Dunlending lands. Indeed, the only fragment of the [[Dunlendish]] language to survive is the word meaning 'Strawheads', [[Forgoil]], seen in the quote above.<ref>{{TT|III7}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Men]] of [[Rohan]] were not the only 'Strawheads' in Middle-earth. Long before Rohan even existed, during the [[First Age]], the land of [[Dor-lómin]] was home to the people of the [[House of Hador]].<ref>{{S|West}}</ref> Like the Rohirrim, these people were noted for their pale hair (indeed, there are suggestions that the Rohirrim may have been descended from them, or at least shared an ancestor). After the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], their lands were overrun by dark-haired [[Easterlings]]. It was the Easterling leader, [[Brodda]], who coined the name 'Strawheads' for the newly conquered people of Dor-lómin.<ref>{{CH|A2}}, List of Names</ref>\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Epithets]]\n[[de:Rohirrim#Namen und Bezeichnungen]]\n[[fr:encyclo/peuples/hommes/forgoil]]\n[[fi:Olkipäät]]"}}}
