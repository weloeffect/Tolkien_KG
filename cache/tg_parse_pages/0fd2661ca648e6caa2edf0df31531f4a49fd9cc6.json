The Hermit's Hat was invented by [[Amazon Studios]] for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]''.\n\n== History ==\nThe Hermit's Hat was a constellation recognized by the [[Mystics]] that could only be seen somewhere deep within [[Rhûn]], \"where the stars are strange\".<ref group=\"Note\">This is a clear misconception made by the TV show. Even though it is said in [[The Fellowship of the Ring]] (II, 2) ‘the far countries of Rhûn and [[Harad]] where the stars are strange’, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] himself said that the ‘strange stars’ apply strictly only to the Harad, which was located in the southern hemisphere, and not to Rhûn ([[Unfinished Tales]], 4, II, Note 10).</ref>\n\nDuring the late [[Second Age]], a group of three Mystics came west from Rhûn seeking [[Sauron]]. When they found [[The Stranger|a being]] they believed to be Sauron, they told him of the Hermit's Hat. They were later defeated by him after realizing that he was an [[Order of Wizards|Istar]] rather than Sauron. Accompanied by [[Elanor Brandyfoot]], the Istar then departed the [[Grove]] for [[Rhûn]] in order to find out more about the constellation.\n\n==Notes==\n\n<references group=\"Note\" />\n\n[[Category:Concepts from adaptations]]"}}}
