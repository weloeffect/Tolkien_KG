The [[East Road]], the main road through the Shire, ran through the town on its way to [[Michel Delving]]. Two smaller roads also led to Waymeet: one from [[Little Delving]] to the north and one from [[Tookland]] and the [[Southfarthing]] beyond.<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref> Where these roadways came together, a town had grown up, appropriately known as Waymeet.\n\n==History==\nIn the [[War of the Ring]], the ruffians who took over the Shire had a staging post or barracks in Waymeet,<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref> and it was from here that [[Sharkey's Men]] set out for the [[Battle of Bywater]], in which they were soundly defeated by the [[Shire-hobbits]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name refers to the village being at the meeting of three ways.<ref name=\"Nomen\">{{HM|N}}, p. 778</ref>\n\nThe name ''Waymeet'' is a modernised spelling of the older form, [[Waymoot]], which was the spelling preferred by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] in early drafts of ''[[The Return of the King]]''. Though he ultimately modernised the name within the book itself, the map of the Shire in the prologue of ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]] '' was never corrected, and still carries the older spelling of the name.<ref name=\"RC\">[[Wayne G.
