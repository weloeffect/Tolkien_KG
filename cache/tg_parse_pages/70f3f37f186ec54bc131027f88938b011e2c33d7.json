As a member of the [[Lambengolmor]], he was known as the \"Sage of the Noldor\", and counted as the greatest Loremaster since [[Fëanor]] and [[Rúmil (elf of Tirion)|Rúmil]].<ref name=Quendi>{{WJ|Quendi}}, pp. 396-7</ref>\n\nPengolodh escaped the [[Fall of Gondolin]] with [[Tuor]] and [[Idril]], and followed them to the [[Mouths of Sirion|Havens of Sirion]].<ref name=Quendi/> The ''[[Annals of Beleriand]]'' are attributed to him, as well as the edited ''[[Annals of Valinor]]'' (furthering the work of Rúmil).\n\nIt was during his stay at the [[Mouths of Sirion]] that Pengolodh did the majority of his work. Basing on information obtained from the refugees of [[Doriath]], he made copies and extracts of documents written in [[Cirth]],<ref name=Quendi/> possibly preserving them as an active writing system; possibly he must have stayed in [[Lindon]] for at least a while after the [[War of Wrath]], so that the [[Dúnedain]] could copy his work.\n\nLater, in the [[Second Age]], he dwelt in the Kingdom of [[Gil-galad|Ereinion Gil-galad]]. Pengolodh was one of the few Elves admitted into [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]],<ref name=Quendi/> where he might have learned [[Khuzdul]].<ref group=note>The essay \"[[Quendi and Eldar]]\" never explicitly mentions that Pengolodh was taught Khuzdul, but in a different account of his life it is stated that he learned Khuzdul \"''in its archaic form as used in the habitations of the Dwarves in [[Blue Mountains|Ered Lindon]]''\" ({{VT|48a}}, p. 6 (Note 3)).</ref> \n\nUnlike the early [[loremasters]] who did not give much importance to ''[[hwermë]]'', it is said that Pengolodh collected much material concerning gesture-systems.<ref>{{WJ|AD}}, pp. 395, 397</ref> \n\nIt was during the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]] and after the fall of [[Eregion]] when Pengolodh left [[Middle-earth]] for [[Tol Eressëa]], last of the Loremasters to leave Middle-earth.<ref name=Quendi/>\n\nAges later, he accepted [[Ælfwine]] the traveler and taught him about the Elves and the [[Elder Days]]. Some of their discussions were recorded as ''[[Dangweth Pengoloð]]''.\n\n==Works==\nThere are many Elvish texts of unknown author that could be attributed to Pengolodh, but here are listed only those explicitly written by him. It is also unknown how many of his works were included in the [[Translations from the Elvish]].\n\n*''[[Annals of Beleriand]]''\n*''[[Dangweth Pengoloð]]''\n**''[[Of Lembas]]''\n*''[[Eldarinwë Leperi arë Notessi]]''\n*''[[Ósanwe-kenta]]'' (only survives summarized)\n*''[[Quendi and Eldar]]''\n\nFirst written by Rúmil:\n*''[[Annals of Valinor]]''\n*''[[Lhammas]]''\n*''[[Ainulindalë]]'' (narrated to Ælfwine by Pengolodh)\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[Sindarin]] name ''Pengolodh'' is glossed as \"'teaching sage', doctor of lore\",<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, p. 139</ref> consisting of the words ''[[pen]]'' (\"somebody\") and ''[[golodh]]'' (\"lore-master, sage\").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-8990395.html|articlename=S.

Various late essays by Tolkien dealing with linguistics are presented as being the work of Pengolodh, including the remarkable work ''[[Quendi and Eldar]]''.\n\nBecause of Pengolodh's nature as a literary device, he does not appear actively as a protagonist in any of the stories. All information about his life come from biographical notes written by Tolkien.\n\nEarly Tolkien texts stated that, after removing to Tol Eressëa, Pengolodh lived in a village called ''[[Tavrobel]]'' (or ''Tathrobel''). Centuries later [[Ælfwine]] spoke with him there. The figure of [[Gilfanon]], which fulfilled a similar role as a chronicler of the annals of Beleriand in earlier works, probably became this character as well in Tolkien's mind.<ref>{{LR|Appendix}}</ref>\n\n===Possible erasure from the legendarium===\nIn the late 1950s Tolkien apparently decided that the [[legendarium]] is not Elvish, but a Mannish tradition.<ref>{{MR|P5I}}</ref> Dawn M. Walls-Thumma notes that after that point, Pengolodh's name fails to be mentioned by Tolkien in the later works and revisions; for example the ''[[Grey Annals]]'' are attributed to Sindarin and Noldorin sources but Pengolodh is not mentioned; Pengolodh was mentioned in the first draft of ''[[The Annals of Aman]]'', along with [[Quennar]] and Rúmil, but in the second draft only Rúmil remains; Pengolodh's name is also removed in a revision of ''[[The Tale of Years (The War of the Jewels)|The Tale of Years]]'' and while Pengolodh was attributed in the First Phase of [[The Later Quenta Silmarillion|The Later ''Quenta Silmarillion'']], his name is removed from the Second Phase. Walls-Thumma however notes that the texts are still Elf-focused and they still include elements that wouldn't be known by Rúmil alone.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Dawn M.
