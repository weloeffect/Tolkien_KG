During the [[Second Age]], it was decided to open a way to the west side of the Silvertine, which would facilitate contact and cooperation with the [[Elves|Elven]] realm of [[Hollin]].<ref name=\"Dark\">{{FR|Journey}}</ref>\n[[File:Anke Eißmann - The Doors of Durin.jpg|thumb|left|''The Doors of Durin'' by [[Anke Eißmann]].]]\nThe '''Elven Door''' was constructed in cooperation between [[Dwarves]] and [[Elves]], sometime between the founding of Eregion in {{SA|750}}<ref>{{App|SA}}, entry for the year 750, p. 1083</ref> and the descruction of Eregion in {{SA|1697|n}}.<ref name=\"SA\">{{App|SA}}, entry for the year 1697, p. 1083</ref> It was the two greatest craftsmen of the Second Age, the [[Noldor|Elf]] and Lord of Eregion, [[Celebrimbor]], and the [[Dwarves|dwarf]] [[Narvi]] who built the Doors.<ref name=\"Dark\"/>\n\nThese were the days before the [[Dark Years]] of [[Sauron]]'s dominion in [[Middle-earth]], and the friendship between Elven and Dwarven kingdoms was a rare and special event. During this peaceful time the Doors stood open, allowing unfettered trade. But during the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]] (in {{SA|1697}}) the Doors were sealed shut after [[Sack of Eregion|Hollin fell]] to Sauron's forces.<ref name=\"SA\"/>\n\nWhen Khazad-dûm was abandoned in {{TA|1981}}<ref name=\"TA\">{{App|TA}}</ref> the way of opening the Doors was forgotten.\n\nAt some point between {{TA|2845|n}} and {{TA|2950|n}} the Wizard [[Gandalf]] entered the city looking for King [[Thráin|Thráin II]] who had disappeared on journey to Erebor. After his search the Wizard exited through the Doors; however this experience did not help him know how to open the doors from the outside.<ref name=\"Dark\"/>\n\nIn {{TA|2994|n}}, during the settling of [[Balin's Colony]], they were attacked by an onslaught of [[orcs]].<ref name=\"TA\"/> [[Óin]] led a group to the west side of the city hoping to find escape through the '''West-gate''', but instead he found the water up to the doors where the [[Watcher in the Water]] killed him. The Dwarves were trapped, and all perished.<ref name=Bridge/>\n\nIn [[August]] {{TA|3018|n}} [[Gollum]] took refuge in Moria; but when he had at last discovered the way to the Doors he could not get out.<ref name=August3018/>\n\n[[Image:Ted Nasmith - Password Into Moria.jpg|thumb|''Password Into Moria'' by [[Ted Nasmith]].]]\nOn [[13 January]] {{TA|3019|n}}<ref name=January3019/> the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] entered Moria through the Doors, but initially Gandalf could not find out the password to open them. [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry Brandybuck]] unknowingly gave Gandalf the answer by asking, \"What does it mean by ''speak, friend, and enter''?\" When Gandalf realized that the correct translation was \"Say friend and enter\" he sprang up, laughed, and said \"''[[Mellon]]''\", which means \"friend\" in [[Sindarin]], and the Doors opened. Shortly thereafter, the [[Watcher in the Water]] attacked the Fellowship and shut the Doors behind them.<ref name=\"Dark\"/> Afterwards [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] was resettled by Dwarves; it is unknown if the Doors of Durin were ever repaired.\n\n==Appearance==\n[[File:Donato Giancola - The Doors of Moria.jpg|thumb|left|''The Doors of Moria'' by [[Donato Giancola]].]]\nThey were fashioned as flush doors, the jambs invisible to the eye, and matched so perfectly with the mountain rock that when closed the Doors could not be seen. The slabs were made by Narvi out of a grey material stronger than stone, and inlaid by Celebrimbor with ''[[ithildin]]'', which could only be seen in starlight and moonlight.\n\nWhen visible, the fine silver-like inlay showed a hammer and anvil (the emblems of [[Durin]]), a crown and [[Seven Stars]] (probably [[Durin's Crown]]), two trees surmounted by crescent moons (probably symbolizing the [[Galathilion|Tree of the High Elves]]), and a single star (the emblem of the [[House of Fëanor]]). On the top left and right corners there were the [[tengwar]] ''[[Calma]]'' (C) and ''[[Óre]]'' (N) standing for Celebrimbor and Narvi; between their feet was an ''[[Ando]]'' (D) for Durin.\n\nThe inscription on the [[Wikipedia:Archivolt|archivolt]] read:\n<blockquote>''\"Ennyn Durin Aran Moria. Pedo Mellon a Minno. Im Narvi hain echant. Celebrimbor o Eregion teithant i thiw hin.\"''</blockquote>\n\nAs Gandalf first translated it to the other Walkers:\n<blockquote>\"The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria. Speak, friend, and enter. I, Narvi, made them. Celebrimbor of Hollin drew these signs.\"</blockquote>\n\nActually, the inscription gave the password that would cause the Doors to swing open. Gandalf's translation is correct, but the proper translation of the second sentence, also correct, is \"Say 'friend' and enter.\"<ref name=\"Dark\"/>\n\nFrom the inside the Doors could be opened by simply pushing against them, though it usually took the thrust of two to do so. When Moria was inhabited by the Dwarves they kept doorwards inside who would help open the Doors and see that only those with permission could pass.<ref>{{UT|Hunt}}, Note 12</ref>\n\n==A possible inconsistency==\nThe name ''[[Moria]]'' means \"Black Chasm\" in [[Sindarin]] and was said to have been given by the Elves \"without love\".<ref name=Trans>{{App|Translation}}: \"Moria is an Elvish name, and given without love; for the Eldar... were not dwellers in such places of choice\"</ref> Some statements seem to imply that the name Moria for Khazad-dûm was only widely used after it fell to [[Durin's Bane]],<ref>{{S|Sindar}}: \"afterwards in the days of its darkness called Moria\"</ref><ref>{{FR|South}}:\"Khazad-dûm, the Dwarrowdelf, that is now called the Black Pit, Moria in the Elvish tongue.\"</ref> although others suggest the name was merely given by the Elves as a result of their lack of love for underground dwellings.<ref name=Trans /> The possibly derogatory nature of this name has led some to question why it appears on doors that were made in a time of friendship between Elves and Dwarves,<ref>{{HM|RC}}, pp. 281-2</ref> but Tolkien has never said that Dwarves find it derogatory and they use it at the end of the Third Age, even talking about its wonders.<ref>{{FR|Council}} \"Glóin sighed. 'Moria! Moria! Wonder of the Northern world!'\"</ref> For a more detailed discussion of potential explanations, see [[Possible inconsistencies in the legendarium#Doors of Durin|Possible inconsistencies in the legendarium]].\n\n==External links==\n*\"[http://lingwe.blogspot.se/2013/01/a-jewish-analogue-to-doors-of-durin.html A Jewish analogue to The Doors of Durin]\" by [[Jason Fisher]]\n*\"[http://lingwe.blogspot.se/2013/04/another-analog-to-doors-of-durin.html Another analog to the Doors of Durin]\" by [[Jason Fisher]]\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Doors and gates]]\n[[Category:Moria]]\n\n[[de:Türen von Durin]]\n[[fi:Morian Länsiportti]]"}}}
