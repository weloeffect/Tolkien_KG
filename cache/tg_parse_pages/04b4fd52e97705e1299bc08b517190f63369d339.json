Tolkien's three volume epic, The Lord of the Rings. Action focuses on the early periods as the Fellowship attempts to move the Ring from the Shire to the vicinity of Mordor. One player controls the forces of Sauron, the Dark Lord; while the other player controls the Fellowship characters and their allies. \n\nThe game uses special cards and plastic markers to implement deployment and hidden movement. The cards and markers even allow certain combats to be resolved without revealing the identities of the combatants. The Fellowship player attempts to avoid, deceive, and misdirect the Enemy player while moving towards Mordor. The Enemy player attempts to force the Fellowship player into combat where the Ring can be retrieved for its rightful master, Sauron of Mordor. \n\nThe rules are organized for a standard scenario and basic game; however optional rules are included for simpler and advanced games.\n\nThis game contains: \n*21\"x26\" full color mounted mapboard of Tolkien's Middle Earth \n*222 illustrated playing cards \n*65 plastic playing pieces \n*40 diecut counters \n*Rulesbook, card displays, charts and tables\n\n==External links==\n*[http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1187/the-fellowship-of-the-ring The Fellowship of the Ring] at [http://boardgamegeek.com/ BoardGameGeek]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fellowship of the Ring (board game), The}}\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Board games]]"}}}
