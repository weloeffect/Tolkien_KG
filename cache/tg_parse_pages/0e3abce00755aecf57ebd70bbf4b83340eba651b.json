He was most notable for his actions at the start of the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] and his later relationship with [[Túrin]].\n\n== History ==\nGwindor was born in [[Nargothrond]]<ref name=NRG/> to [[Guilin]], and was the brother of [[Gelmir (son of Guilin)|Gelmir]]. He was reckoned as a bold leader, and the scout who scoured most far afield of the folk of Nargothrond.<ref>{{LB|1d}}</ref> He was betrothed to [[Finduilas]] the daughter of [[Orodreth]]. \n\n=== Battle of Unnumbered Tears and thralldom===\nHis brother was lost during the [[Dagor Bragollach]], and wishing to avenge this loss, he joined the [[Union of Maedhros]] and followed [[Fingon]] to battle.\n\nDuring the assault, Gwindor led a small company of Elves of Nargothrond stationed at [[Barad Eithel]]. But the hosts of [[Morgoth]] were prepared; they brought his brother, still alive, then mutilated and slew him in front of the company. At the sight of Gelmir's mangled corpse, he charged on the plains of [[Anfauglith]], and thus beginning the battle of [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]. It is said that Morgoth trembled as his company pounded on his gates, but he had ambushed the company within Angband itself, and all but Gwindor were slain.<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>\n\nHe spent fourteen years as a captive slave in Angband where the strength and beauty of his body were ruined. At some point, he received a small sword from another Elf who worked in the forges and, while working in a [[Thrall-Noldoli|stone-gang]], turned suddenly on the guards. Though he lost a hand in that fight, he managed to escape and fled southwards, eventually reaching [[Taur-nu-Fuin]].<ref>{{CH|9}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Ted Nasmith - Beleg is Slain.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Beleg is Slain'']]\nAs Gwindor lay exhausted, he was found by [[Beleg]] who was looking for his friend [[Túrin]]. Gwindor helped Beleg locate the [[Orc]]-band that had captured Túrin, and they freed him. But Túrin thought Beleg was an Orc and killed him before realizing his mistake. Gwindor consoled Túrin in his grief and led him to Nargothrond.\n\n=== Return to Nargothrond ===\nTúrin was admitted in the Elven realm thanks to Gwindor, but now Gwindor was worn out and did not have the power he once had before his capture. \"Agarwaen\" (Túrin's name while he stayed there) gained much influence among the Elves of Nargothrond and even Finduilas fell in love with him, a fact that Gwindor accepted without bitterness for Túrin. Believing that Finduilas would save Túrin from his fate, Gwindor revealed Agarwaen's identity to Finduilas, while he tried to persuade Túrin to return her feelings.\n\nBut when Túrin talked about open warfare upon Morgoth's forces, Gwindor could see the incoming doom of Nargothrond approach and counselled against this, only to be ignored. Orodreth the [[King of Nargothrond]] built a bridge, which not only eliminated the defence provided by the river [[Narog]], but also revealed the location of the Kingdom.\n\nIndeed, Gwindor was right and [[Glaurung]] with a band of Orcs came. The Elves were driven towards the plain of [[Tumhalad]], where most of them, including King Orodreth and Gwindor, were slain in [[Battle of Tumhalad|battle]]. Before dying, he assigned the protection of Finduilas to Túrin, and that she alone could save him from the Curse of Morgoth; however his [[foresight]] did not come to be, as Túrin failed to protect her.<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{Pronounce|Gwindor.mp3|Ardamir}}\nThe name is not explained, however in ''[[The Etymologies]]'', the name-element ''-dor'' (a compounded form of [[Noldorin]] ''[[taur]]'') has the sense of \"king, master\".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry \"TA\", \"TA3\"</ref>\n\nIt has been suggested that the first element of the name could be ''gwind'' \"pale blue\".<ref>{{webcite|website=EoA|articleurl=http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/g/gwindor.html|articlename=Gwindor}}, citing {{LR|Etymologies}}, entry \"WIN\"</ref>\n<!-- Another possibility from The Etymologies could be gwing \"spindrift\" -->\n\nIt has been suggested by Paul Strack and David Salo that the ''Gwindor'' is a [[Sindarin]] name could be derived from a combination of the elements ''[[gwain]]'' (\"new\") + ''[[-dor]]'' (\"lord\").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3281252999.html|articlename=S.

He then stood beside Túrin in protecting the dwelling of Galweg from the ransacking Orcs until he was felled by an arrow to the eye.<ref name=foaloke/>\n\n=== Lays of Beleriand ===\nIn ''[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]'', after escaping from the mines of Melkor, Flinding first crossed the [[Plains of Drouth]] before entering Taur-nu-Fuin. There his feet were entangled and he became enmeshed in its mazes, and he was taken by madness and wandered witless until he was heard by Orcs and pursued. The Orcs eventually found him, \"grovelled fainting\" and \"cowering\" and took him back to their camp. There he saw their spoils, countless chained captives (including Elfin maids), and Túrin held in baleful bonds. While in a bleeding swoon, the Orcs threw Flinding on the \"dung and slough\" of their lair, but he then escaped \"as a crawling worm on belly cowering\". \n\nBeleg insisted that Flinding show him the way to the Orc camp, which Flinding initially declined, stating that fear fettered him, and he would prefer to die in the dark, dazed and forwandered, than return to that anguish; he even claimed that he did not know the way. Beleg then admonished Flinding, reminding him of the might, mirth and renown of the Gnomes of Nargothrond. At this, Flinding fought the fear in his heart and started to lead Beleg to the Orc camp.<ref name=beleg>{{LB|1c}}</ref>\n\n=== Later works ===\nIn ''[[The Earliest Annals of Beleriand]]'' he is renamed to '''''Findor''' son of Fuilin'', and then a final time to ''Gwindor son of Guilin''.<ref>{{SM|7In}}, p. 312, note 40</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Children of Húrin]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Noldor]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n\n[[de:Gwindor]]\n[[fi:Gwindor]]\n[[fr:encyclo:personnages:elfes:noldor:gwindor]]"}}}
