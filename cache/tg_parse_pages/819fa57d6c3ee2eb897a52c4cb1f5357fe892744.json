[[Glaurung]], the [[Father of Dragons]], was the first of the species.<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref> He first appeared during the late [[First Age]], but the Urulóki were known to have survived even after the [[War of Wrath|downfall]] of the Dark Lord [[Morgoth]], troubling the [[Dwarves]]. Another dragon considered to be of the fire-drakes during the [[Elder Days]] was [[Ancalagon|Ancalagon the Black]].\n\n[[Smaug]], the last of the truly powerful dragons, was slain by [[Bard]] in the late [[Third Age]].<ref>{{HM|H}}, ''passim''</ref> We can be sure that he was not the last of the fire-drakes, though, because [[Gandalf]] refers to fire-breathing dragons in the time before the [[War of the Ring]], nearly eighty years after Smaug's death.<ref>{{FR|I2}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn \"[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]\", the first tale of the [[legendarium]], multiple Fire-drakes are mentioned. Most of the time it is not clear if they are different from the [[Iron Dragons]], although some of them are clearly living creatures, like the \"creature of fire with [[Balrogs]] upon it\" or the Fire-drake that dried the [[Fountain of the King]].<ref>{{LT2|III}}, pp. 181, 184</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Dragons]]\n[[Category:Servants of Melkor]]\n[[de:Drachen]]\n[[fi:Lohikäärmeet]]"}}}
