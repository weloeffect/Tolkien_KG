Its predecessor was a seedling of [[Nimloth of Númenor|Nimloth]], planted in [[Minas Ithil]], that was destroyed before the end of the [[Second Age]].\n\nThe White Tree also appears on the [[livery of the heirs of Elendil]], which was worn by the [[Guards of the Citadel]] of Minas Tirith,<ref>{{RK|MT}}, p. 753</ref> on the [[standard of Elendil]],<ref>{{RK|Company}}, p. 789</ref> and on the royal banner of Gondor.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}, p. 1052</ref>\n\n==History==\n===First White Tree===\nThe first White Tree came from a fruit that [[Isildur]], at great personal risk, managed to steal from [[Nimloth (tree)|Nimloth]] the Fair, the White Tree of [[Númenor]], before that one was destroyed at [[Sauron]]'s insistence. He suffered many wounds during this mission, and he came near death, but when the first leaf opened in the spring, Isildur was healed.\n\nThis sapling was brought to [[Middle-earth]] on Isildur's ship, and it was eventually planted in [[Minas Ithil]] before his house. But when Sauron returned to Middle-earth, he launched a [[First Fall of Minas Ithil|sudden attack]] in {{SA|3429}} that captured Minas Ithil, and he burned the White Tree. Isildur escaped, taking with him again a sapling.<ref>{{App|B1}}</ref><ref name=rings>{{S|Rings}}</ref>\n\n===Second White Tree===\nIn the year {{TA|2}}, Isildur planted the seedling of the White Tree in [[Minas Anor]] in memory of his brother, [[Anárion]].<ref name=rings/><ref name=B2/>\n\nThis White Tree lasted until {{TA|1636}}, when the [[Great Plague]] struck [[Gondor]], killing King [[Telemnar]] and his children among many others.<ref name=B2/>\n\n===Third White Tree===\n{{seealso|Dead Tree}}\n[[File:J.R.R.

Then he discovered (with [[Gandalf]]'s help) a sapling of the White Tree in the high hallow upon the slopes of [[Mindolluin]], above Minas Tirith. This sapling he reverently planted in its place, and he took it as a sign that Arwen would arrive soon. In June of {{TA|3019}} the sapling bloomed.<ref>{{RK|VI5}}</ref><ref group=note>There is an inconsistency in dates: according to ''[[Appendix B]]'', Elessar found the sapling on [[June 25]]; however the chapter ''The Steward and the King'' states that \"when the month of June entered in it was laden with blossom\", implying here that Aragorn planted the sapling ''before'' June began.</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | |TEL| | | | | LAU=[[Laurelin]]|TEL=[[Telperion]]<br><small>Destroyed by [[Morgoth]] and [[Ungoliant]]</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | }}\n{{familytree | | | |GAL| | | | | GAL=[[Galathilion]] on [[Túna]]<br><small>Made in the image of Telperion</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | |!| | | | | }}\n{{familytree | | | |CEL| | | CEL=[[Celeborn (White Tree)|Celeborn]] of [[Tol Eressëa]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | |!| | | | | }}\n{{familytree | | | |NIM| | | NIM=[[Nimloth (tree)|Nimloth]] of [[Númenor]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | |!| | | | | }}\n{{familytree | | | |G1| | | | |G1=<small>[[#First White Tree|First Tree of Gondor]] ([[Minas Ithil]])<br>{{SA|3320}} - {{SA|3429|n}} (planted by [[Isildur]])</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | |!| | | | | }}\n{{familytree | | | |G2| | | | |G2=<small>[[#Second White Tree|Second Tree of Gondor]] ([[Minas Anor]])<br>{{TA|2}} - {{TA|1636|n}} (planted by Isildur)</small> }}\n{{familytree | | | | |!| | | | | }}\n{{familytree | | | |G3 | | | | |G3=<small>[[#Third White Tree|Third Tree of Gondor]] ([[Minas Tirith]])<br>{{TA|1640}} - {{TA|2872|n}} (planted by [[Tarondor (King of Gondor)|Tarondor]])</small> }}\n{{familytree | | | | |!| | | | | }}\n{{familytree | | | |G4 | | | | |G4=<small>[[#Fourth White Tree|Fourth Tree of Gondor]] (Minas Tirith)<br>Since {{TA|3019}} (planted by [[Aragorn|Elessar]])</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n==Inspiration==\nThe White Tree has been compared to the medieval legend of the [[Wikipedia:Dry Tree|Dry Tree]].<ref>[[John Garth]], ''[[The Worlds of J.R.R.
