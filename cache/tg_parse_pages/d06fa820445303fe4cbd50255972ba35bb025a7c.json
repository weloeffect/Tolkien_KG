Tolkien]]'s works. If there was a specific type of \"fan\" he would equate to, it would probably be one of those big wind machines film studios use. He has decided to dedicate his time to spreading the word about the Professor's masterpieces and to working with the community in developing media and content related to the myths. He is by no means advanced in the Lore of Tolkien's works but only wishes to contribute to the community the only way he knows how; through technology. If you have anything web/technology related to J.R.R. Tolkien you need help with please let him know and he would be happy to help.\n\n===Contact information===\n* '''Email:''' {{nospam|hyarion|gmail.com}}\n* '''Discord:''' Hyarion\n* Or always on his [[User_talk:Hyarion|talk page]].\n\n===What he does here===\nMainly maintenance and behind the scenes work. I leave the real work to the scholars out there.\n\n===Current projects===\n* See [[Tolkien Gateway:Projects]]\n\n===Subpages===\n* [[User:Hyarion/Reviews|Reviews]]\n* [[User:Hyarion/Collection|Collection]]\n** [[User:Hyarion/Collection/Books|Books]]\n* [[User:Hyarion/For Sale|For Sale]]\n\n\n\n[[Category:Tolkien Society members]]"}}}
