In the [[Third Age]], Círdan gave the ring to [[Gandalf]] for his labours.<ref name=\"TA\">{{App|TA}}</ref> \n\nAccording to the ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', at the start of the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]] Celebrimbor gave Narya together with the Ring [[Vilya]] to [[Gil-galad]], High King of the [[Noldor]]. Gil-galad entrusted Narya to his lieutenant [[Círdan]], Lord of the Havens of [[Grey Havens|Mithlond]], who kept it after Gil-galad's death.<ref>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref> \n\n{{blockquote|Take this ring, master, [...] for your labours will be heavy; but it will support you in the weariness that you have taken upon yourself.
