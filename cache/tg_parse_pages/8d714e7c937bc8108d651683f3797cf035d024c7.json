The main road, which crossed the Sirion at the [[Ford of Brithiach]] to [[Himring]], cut Dimbar in half; to the north of the road the land climbed to the vales of the [[Crissaegrim]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>\n\nNo settlements or inhabitants were mentioned in Dimbar.<ref>[[Robert Foster]], ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', entry \"Dimbar\"</ref>\n==History==\nDuring a battle with [[orcs]], [[Huor]] and [[Húrin]], at a very young age, became lost and desperate in a mist in Dimbar. They were found by [[Thorondor]], and would be the first mortals to see [[Gondolin]].<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], [[Orcs]] from [[Taur-nu-Fuin]] built a road through [[Anach]] and the land was overrun by Orcs. [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]] and [[Beleg|Beleg Strongbow]] would lead raids against them.<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>\n\nAfter [[Morgoth]] had freed [[Húrin]], he came to the land of Dimbar. There he stood before the silent cliffs of the [[Echoriath]] and cried out for [[Turgon]] to hear him. But Húrin had been followed and was heard, and his words told Morgoth where Turgon dwelt.<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Dimbar'' is [[Sindarin]] from ''[[dem]]'' (\"sad\")<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry \"DEM\"</ref> and ''[[-mbar]]'' (\"dwellingplace, home\").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entry ''bâr''</ref>\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Beleriand]]\n[[Category:Regions]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[de:Dimbar]]\n[[fi:Dimbar]]\n[[fr:encyclo:geographie:regions:beleriand:dimbar]]"}}}
