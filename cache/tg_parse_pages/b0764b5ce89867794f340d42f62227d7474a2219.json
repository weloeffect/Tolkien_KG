He was often said to be remarkably similar to [[Elendil]], his grandfather. (Considered \"one of the greatest, the fairest of the seed of Elendil.\")<ref name=\"Gladden\">{{UT|Gladden}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Middle-earth]], he stayed by his father's side, and fought with him in the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. Isildur had sent [[Aratan]] and [[Ciryon]] to [[Minas Ithil]] to guard against a possible escape, therefore, after the [[Battle of Dagorlad]], Elendur alone accompanied his father into [[Mordor]].  Elendur was not present at the final fight with [[Sauron]] on the slopes of [[Mount Doom]]<ref>{{UT|Gladden}}, note 11</ref> where his grandfather was killed and his father avenged him. Being the most trusted of his sons, he was the only among his brothers with knowledge of [[the One Ring]] possessed by Isildur.<ref name=\"Gladden\"/>\n\n===Death===\nAfter the war, in {{TA|2}}, Elendur with his brothers and 200 knights and soldiers, escorted his father back to [[Rivendell|Imladris]]. They passed [[Dagorlad]] and sought to follow [[Anduin]] upstream until [[Amon Lanc]]. From there, they followed old Sylvan paths on the eaves of [[Mirkwood|Greenwood]]. On [[5 October]], when they were at the [[Gladden Fields]], the company was attacked by [[Orcs]] coming from the [[Misty Mountains]], but led by servants of [[Barad-dûr]]. \n\nCiryon was dead and Aratan was dying, and orcs overran them from all sides. Though Isildur had sent [[Ohtar]] away to preserve the shards of [[Narsil]], the King still bore the [[Elendilmir]] and the Ring, about which Elendur knew. He argued with his father, thinking it was wise for him to flee and abandon them.  Isildur did eventually flee, but was pierced by arrows after he swam across the Anduin. Elendur took command of what remained, and was slain with his troops.<ref name=\"Gladden\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Elendur'' is a [[Quenya]] name. Its meaning is not glossed. [[Helge Fauskanger]] suggests it was probably intended to mean \"Elf-servant\", but literally means \"Star-servant\".<ref>{{webcite|author=Helge Fauskanger|articleurl=https://folk.uib.no/hnohf/quen-eng.htm|articlename='''Elendur'''|website=Quettaparma Quenyallo|accessed=27 January 2022}}</ref> The [[Edain]] found it difficult to determine whether words and names containing the element ''el'' referred to the stars or to the Elves.<ref>{{WJ|Author}}, Note 10, p. 410</ref> The first element, ''[[elen]]'', was likely taken from his grandfather's name, where it was intended to mean \"Elf\".<ref name=L297>{{L|297|118}}</ref> The second element, ''[[-ndur]]'' was likely taken from his father's name, where it means \"servant\" from the verb \"to serve\".<ref name=L297/>\n\nThe later [[Elendur (King of Arnor)|King of Arnor Elendur]] was likely named after him.\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | ELE | | | | | |ELE=[[Elendil]]<br/><small>''{{SA|3119}} - {{SA|3441|n}}''†</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | |,|-|-|-|-|^|-|-|-|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | ISI | | | | | | | | ANA |ISI=[[Isildur]]<br/><small>''{{SA|3209}} - {{TA|2}}''†</small>|ANA=[[Anárion]]<br/><small>''{{SA|3219}} - {{SA|3440|n}}''†</small>}}\n{{familytree | |,|-|-|-|v|-|^|-|v|-|-|-|.| | | |:| |}}\n{{familytree | ELE | | ARA | | CIR | | VAL | | GON |ELE='''ELENDUR'''<br/><small>''{{SA|3299}} - {{TA|2}}''†</small>|ARA=[[Aratan]]<br/><small>''{{SA|3339}} - {{TA|2}}''†</small>|CIR=[[Ciryon]]<br/><small>''{{SA|3379}} - {{TA|2}}''†</small>|VAL=[[Valandil (King of Arnor)|Valandil]]<br/><small>''{{SA|3430}} - {{TA|249}}''</small>|GON=[[Kings of Gondor|''Kings of<br/>Gondor'']]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | ELD | | | | |ELD=[[Eldacar (King of Arnor)|Eldacar]]<br/><small>''{{TA|87}} - {{TA|339|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | ARA | | | | |ARA=[[Arantar]]<br/><small>''{{TA|185}} - {{TA|435|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn early manuscripts Elendur was named \"Kiryandil\" and his date of birth was {{SA|3318}}, which made him and not [[Meneldil]] the last man born in Númenor.<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, Commentary</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Elendur.jpg|thumb|Elendur in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2019: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The three elder sons of Isildur appear during an extended flashback set during the [[Siege of Barad-dûr]] in the year [[Second Age 3440|S.A. 3440]].
