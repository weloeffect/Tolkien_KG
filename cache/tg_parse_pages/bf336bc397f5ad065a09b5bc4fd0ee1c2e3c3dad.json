Hailed by critics worldwide, part one of the movie trilogy was a box-office smash, one of the most successful films of the decade. Peter Jackson's \"fierce, imaginative movie takes high-flying risks and inspires with its power and scale,\" wrote Newsweek. \"In every way this is moviemaking on a grand scale,\" wrote the San Francisco Chronicle, while Time proclaimed the \"grandeur, moral heft and emotional depth\" of the film, which received thirteen Academy Award(R) nominations. \n\nIncluding more than 300 photographs from all three films, most unique to this book, and exclusive interviews with all the cast and crew, Brian Sibley's fascinating book takes every fan inside the process of adapting J.R.R. Tolkien's masterwork for the screen. For the first time in history, three major movies were made at the same time, a triumphant and monumental undertaking that took the world by storm. Here can be found details about the hundreds of dedicated artists, craftspeople and cast and crew members who labored for years -- adding authenticity at every stage -- to bring one of the greatest stories ever told to an eager film audience. Sibley takes us inside the process of filmmaking to show us how the magic is made -- from the director, writers and actors to wardrobe, makeup, miniatures, music and digital special effects, it's all here.\n\n{{quote|It was tiring, physically and mentally, but never dull. Three movies, one big story, and so much variety: one day shooting scenes of intimate heart-wrenching drama, the next, vast battle scenes involving hundreds of extras. Every day brought an opportunity to create something new on this enormous canvas that is The Lord of the Rings.|Peter Jackson}}\n\n{{lordoftheringsfilms}}\n\n{{title|italics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lord of the Rings: The Making of the Movie Trilogy}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings (film series) tie-in books]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
