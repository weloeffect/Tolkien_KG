The atlas was however published before ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', where it was revealed that the [[Sea of Rhûn]] existed already in the [[First Age]], as an apparently different body of water than the Sea of Helcar.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''1982-1997: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''\n:The river that flows northeastwards from the southern part of the western ''Ephel Dúath'' is called ''Dúaduin'' on a map of the plateau of Gorgoroth and the western part of ''Nurn''. A smaller river that flows southeast in the direction of the western part of Lake Núrnen from a source in the mountain spur that branches off to the northeast in the southern part of the western ''Ephel Dúath'', a source in the mountain spur that branches off to the southwest from the eastern part of the ''Ered Litui'' and a source roughly in the middle of the gap in between those mountain spurs is called ''Ruinen'' on that map.<ref>{{ICE|3112}}, Color Terrain Map by Pete Fenlon</ref> The longest river in ''Mordor'' that flows (southeastwards and then) southwestwards from the northern part of the mountain spur that branches off to the southwest from the eastern part of the ''Ered Litui'' to Lake Núrnen is called ''Sirilith'' in the Geographic Features section of the Mordor Gazetteer that was made by MERP fans. A river that flows (southeastards) from the southern part of the mountain spur that branches off to the southwest from the eastern part of the ''Ered Litui'' to Lake Núrnen is called ''Caranduin'' in that Gazetteer. A river that flows (northwestwards and then) northeastwards from the eastern part of the southern ''Ephel Dúath'' to Lake Núrnen is called ''Culduin'' in that Gazetteer. A river that flows northeast from the [[Nargil Pass]] (in the central part of the southern part of the Ephel Dúath) to Lake Núrnen was called ''Nargil River'' in that Gazetteer. The Gazetteer also includes ''Gurthrant River'' as an alternative name of the ''Dúaduin'' and states that the ''Dúaduin'' and the ''Ruinen'' flowed into Lake Núrnen.\n\n'''2014: [[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]:'''\n:Queen [[Marwen]] is the queen of the Tribesmen of Núrnen and rules over the Sea of Núrnen.\n\n'''2022: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'':'''\n:In the second [[Adrift|episode]], when [[Bronwyn]] tries to warn the [[Men|Southlanders]] of [[Tirharad]] in [[Waldreg|Waldreg's]] tavern of the ruin of [[Hordern]], Waldreg notes that '''Crookfinger Lake''' has always been spewing vapors, possibly referring to Lake Núrnen as it is the only and the most well known body of water nearby. The dark and damp forested lake that [[Arondir]] was suddenly seized from may possibly be a sub lake of Crookfinger Lake.\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sea of Nurnen}}\n\n[[Category:Lakes]]\n[[Category:Mordor]]\n[[Category:Nurn]]\n[[Category:Seas and oceans]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n\n[[fr:/encyclo/geographie/eaux/mordor/mer_de_nurnen]]"}}}
