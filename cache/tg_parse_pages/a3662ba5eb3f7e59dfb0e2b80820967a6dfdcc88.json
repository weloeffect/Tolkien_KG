The mouth of the bay was in the southwest, between the Blue Mountains and the Cape of [[Forochel]], which separated most of the bay from [[Belegaer]].<ref name=UTMap>{{UT|Map}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nA long time ago before a people known as the [[Forodwaith (people)|Forodwaith]], who were used to endure the bitter cold of the realm of [[Morgoth]] settled in the far north. In the [[Third Age]] a remnant of these people was known as the [[Lossoth]] or the Snowmen of Forochel. The Lossoth lived on the Cape of Forochel most of the time, but they also camped on the southern shore of the bay at the feet of the Blue Mountains.<ref name=Eriador>{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', p. 1041 and footnote to the Snowmen of Forochel</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|1974}} the kingdom of [[Arthedain]] was overrun by the forces of [[Angmar]]. King [[Arvedui]] fled to the north, first to the [[Far Downs]], then near the northern end of the Blue Mountains and finally, driven by hunger, to a camp of the Lossoth at the shore of the bay. Partly from fear and partly from pity these people fed and sheltered the king and his men. Then, in March<ref name=Eriador/> of {{TA|1975|n}},<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1975 p. 1086</ref> a ship from [[Círdan]] reached the Icebay to take Arvedui and his party onboard. After they set sail a storm arose which crushed the ship in the ice and the king, his men, and all the mariners perished in the sea.<ref name=Eriador/>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nOn Christopher Tolkien's [[General Map of Middle-earth]] the label \"Ice Bay of Forochel\" was placed in the water in the smaller southern lobe of the bay.<ref>[[Christopher Tolkien]], [[General Map of Middle-earth]]</ref><ref>{{FR|Map}}</ref> When [[Christopher Tolkien]] redrew his map, he placed the label on the shore just below the smaller southern lobe of the bay and added an arrow after the label that pointed to the larger northeast part of the bay.<ref name=UTMap/> Christopher Tolkien stated that he had little doubt that the water with the label \"Ice Bay of Forochel\" on his original map was only a small part of the full immense Bay of Forochel.<ref>{{UT|IMap}}, footnote to Cape of Forochel</ref> The full extent of the Icebay is shown on J.R.R. Tolkien's [[The First Map of The Lord of the Rings]] and on Map IA that was redrawn by [[Christopher Tolkien]] based on this map and published in ''[[The Treason of Isengard]]''.<ref>{{TI|MI}}, p. 303</ref>\n\n== Portrayal in adaptations ==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Icebay of Forochel.jpg|thumb|right|Icebay of Forochel in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Icebay was the smaller body of water, the larger bay was not featured in the game. It contained many small islands and icebergs, including Sâri-surma, lair of the Gaunt-lord Drugoth the Death-monger. The wreckage of [[Arvedui]]'s ship ''Thoroval'' was located in some ice off the coast of the north-western shore. It was haunted by the shade of the king, who had cursed himself in his final moments.\n\n{{References}}\n\n{{Navigation\n| title=Icebay of Forochel\n| north-west=[[Cape of Forochel]]\n| north=[[Cape of Forochel]]\n| north-east='''[[Forodwaith (lands)|Forodwaith]]'''\n| west='''[[Belegaer]]'''\n| east='''[[Forodwaith (lands)|Forodwaith]]'''\n| south-west=[[Ered Luin]], [[Lindon]]\n| south=[[Hills of Evendim]], [[North Downs]].
