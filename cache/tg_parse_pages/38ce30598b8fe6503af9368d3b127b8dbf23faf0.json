''[...]'' Greatest of the forests of the Northern world.

It was previously called Greenwood the Great ([[Sindarin|S]]: ''Eryn Galen'') until the Shadow of the influence of Sauron fell on it. It was named the [[Eryn Lasgalen|Wood of Greenleaves]] ([[Sindarin|S]]: ''[[Eryn Lasgalen]]'') when the shadow was lifted after the defeat of Sauron.\n\n== Geography ==\nMirkwood seems to have had much the same boundaries as it did at the end of the Third Age for most of its history. It was roughly rectangular in shape: stretching from the foothills of the [[Grey Mountains]] in the north to the [[North Undeep]] in the south, and from the east edge of the vale of [[Anduin]] to the [[Lonely Mountain]].\n\nIt was bisected by the ancient [[Old Forest Road]]. Later, when this road became unusable, a second path through the forest was made to the north. Between the two paths lay the [[Mountains of Mirkwood]]. The [[Forest River]] cut through the forest's northern end from its source in the western Grey Mountains, joined in the centre by the [[Enchanted River]] which flowed north from the Mountains of Mirkwood.\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Map of Wilderland.jpg|thumb|right|Map of [[Rhovanion|Wilderland]] by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] showing the northern part of Mirkwood.]]\nSouth of the Old Forest road the [[East Bight]] created the ''Narrows of the Forest'', only one hundred miles across. South and west of the narrows was the a hill called [[Amon Lanc]].\n\n== History ==\n=== First Age ===\n[[File:Lída Holubová - Mirkwood 2.jpg|thumb|Nandor in Mirkwood (art by [[Lída Holubová]]]]\nOriginally called Greenwood the Great, the forest may have once formed part of the vast primeval woodland which covered most of [[Middle-earth]] during the [[Years of the Trees]] in the [[First Age]], possibly linked to Lothlórien across the Anduin.<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}} p. 252</ref> The [[Eldar]] passed through the area on their [[Great Journey|journey]] to [[Valinor]] and it was first populated at this time by the [[Nandor]]. Unwilling to cross the [[Misty Mountains]], these Elves settled also in the wooded valleys of the river Anduin. They multiplied and were joined by wandering [[Avari]], becoming known as Silvan or Wood-elves.\n\nThe Old Forest Road was constructed very early in Greenwood's history by the [[Durin's Folk|Longbeard]] [[Dwarves]] to carry traffic between their territory in the Misty Mountains to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], and the [[Iron Hills]].This road would be later abandoned as the [[Orcs]] of the [[Misty Mountains]] and [[Grey Mountains]] took [[Mount Gundabad|Gundabad]] and the surrounding region, cutting off communication between Khazad-dûm and the Iron Hills and Erebor.<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref>\n\n=== Second Age ===\nIn around the year {{SA|750}}, the [[Sindar|Sinda]] prince, [[Oropher]], removed from [[Lindon]] to Greenwood where he was taken by the Silvan Elves as their lord. This forested region to the east of the [[Anduin]] is where [[Silvan Elves]], of [[Nandor]] descent and the [[Avari]], lived.<ref>{{PM|Second}}</ref> Oropher built his halls at [[Amon Lanc]] and was accepted as the leader of the Wood-elves of Greenwood, later the [[Elves of Mirkwood]], forming the [[Woodland Realm]].\n\nDuring the First and Second Age, the [[Northmen]], such as the ancestors of the [[Woodmen]], had been allies of the [[Longbeards]] and the [[Dwarves]] of the hills surrounding the Greenwood, and were enemies of the [[Orcs]] and [[Easterlings]].<ref>{{PM|Relations}}, third, fourth and seventh paragraph</ref> The Woodmen maintained friendly relations with the Elves of the Greenwood.<ref name=UT>{{UT|Gladden}}, ''The sources of the legend of Isildur's death'', first paragraph</ref>\n\n=== Third Age ===\nThe first millennium of the [[Third Age]] probably saw the creation of the East Bight by men living in the eastern eaves of the forest. These men may have formed part of the [[Rhovanion|Kingdom of Rhovanion]] led by [[Vidugavia]]. Men, such as the [[Éothéod]], and [[Hobbits]] also lived in the vale of Anduin and were likely responsible for the retreat of the forest's western border.\n[[File:Marya Filatova - Thranduil 2.jpg|thumb|\"[[Thranduil]]\" by [[Marya Filatova]]]]\nAt the beginning of the Third Age, [[Thranduil]] replaced [[Oropher]] as king of the Woodland Realm. Probably as a result of massive losses at the [[Battle of Dagorlad]] the Silvan population of Greenwood was diminished and became mainly concentrated in the hills then known as [[Mountains of Mirkwood|Emyn Duir]]. At the beginning of the second millennium of the Third Age, a mysterious being came to Amon Lanc in the south of Greenwood the Great, and there built the stronghold known as [[Dol Guldur]]; \"hill of sorcery.\" This was the magician known as the Necromancer, who was later revealed to be none other than Sauron himself, and from his fortress tower a shadow of nightshade began to spread across the woodlands. The story of Sauron's darkening of Greenwood the Great mirrors events in the [[First Age]], when he occupied the highland forests of [[Dorthonion]], north of [[Beleriand]]. That region, too, fell under his shadow, and was also known as [[Taur-nu-Fuin (Dorthonion)|Taur-nu-Fuin]]. From that time on, the Elves came to refer to the Greenwood as Taur-nu-Fuin, the forest under nightshade, rendered into the [[Mannish]] tongue as 'Mirkwood'.\n\nAround the [[Third Age 1636|same time]] as the [[Great Plague]] devastated [[Gondor]] and [[Eriador]], the [[Shadow]] grew deep in Greenwood and evil things reappeared. Later the wise noted this coincidence and considered it a sign of Sauron's return.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>\n\nIndeed, by the time of [[Cirion]] (c. T.A. 2500), [[Dol Guldur]] controlled the [[Balchoth]], a tribe of [[Easterlings]] who dwelt east of Mirkwood; often they made raids through the forest up to the [[Vales of Anduin]], until they were all but deserted, until [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant|defeated]].<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref>\n[[File:Alan Lee - The Elvenking's Gate.jpg|thumb|''The Elvenking's Gate'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]\nSauron's arrival caused a darkening of Greenwood, and at this point it became known as Mirkwood. The children of [[Shelob]], giant [[spiders]], as well as bats and orcs in Dol Guldur's service occupied the forest and it became thicker, darker and covered in cobwebs.<ref>{{H|Flies}}</ref>\n\nThis caused Thranduil to lead the Silvan population of Mirkwood to migrate north for the last time, north of the forest river. The Wood-elves specifically dwell  apparently exclusively in the [[Elvenking's Halls]] at the eastern end of the Forest River. The ancient Old Forest Road was abandoned by men and Dwarves alike, with a new but seldom used path being made further from Dol Guldur and the Hobbits near the forest's eastern border migrated away.\n\nMirkwood remained a place of fear throughout the Third Age, though the kingdoms of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] and [[Dale]] flourished briefly in the time of the [[King under the Mountain|Kings under the Mountain]]. This prosperity was ended by the arrival of the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Smaug]] who brought yet further desolation to the area north-eastern Mirkwood. Small homesteads of 'Woodmen' are also recorded as living in the western edge of the forest south of the old road in {{TA|2941|n}}.<ref>{{HM|H}}, \"Map of Wilderland\"</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|2850|n}}, [[Gandalf]] visited Mirkwood and entered Dol Guldur, this time in secret. The Grey Pilgrim discovered that the Necromancer was none other than Sauron, who had regained his powers, millennia after the Battle of Dagorlad.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2850, p. 1088</ref>\n\n[[File:Galadriel dol guldur bfmeII.JPG|thumb|left|Galadriel casts down the walls of Dol Guldur]]\n[[File:Peter Pracownik - Five of Coins.jpeg|thumb|[[Thorin and Company|Thorin's Company]] in Mirkwood]]\nIn {{TA|2941}}, as [[Thorin and Company]] were going on the [[Quest of Erebor]], the shadow over Mirkwood was lifted, albeit temporarily. While Thorin and Company were journeying to Erebor, the [[White Council]], prompted by the [[Wizards|Wizard]] [[Gandalf]]'s discovery of the true identity of Sauron drove him from Dol Guldur. Gandalf also planned the successful [[Quest of Erebor]], which resulted in the slaying of Smaug in the same year. The combination of these two events allowed the re-established kingdoms of Erebor and Dale and the flourishing of the Woodland Realm and of a confederacy of Woodmen led by the [[Beornings]]. The Darkness of Mirkwood was lifted for a while.\n\nOnly ten years after these events in {{TA|2951}} Sauron, now based in [[Mordor]], sent [[Khamûl]] and two other [[Nazgûl]] to reoccupy Dol Guldur.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2951, p. 1089</ref>\n\nOn 21 March {{TA|3018|n}}, [[Aragorn]] who had captured [[Gollum]] in the [[Dead Marshes]] arrived with Gollum in Mirkwood.<ref>{{UT|Other}}</ref>\n\nTwo days later, on 23 March {{TA|3018|n}}, Gandalf arrived in Mirkwood<ref name=Note6>{{UT|Other}} note 6</ref> and began to interrogate Gollum.<ref>{{UT|Other}} and note 4</ref>\n\nOn 29 March {{TA|3018|n}}, Gandalf left Mirkwood.<ref name=Note6/>\n\nOn 20 June, Orcs attacked the Elves of Mirkwood and Gollum was able to escape from his captivity.<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3018, June 20, p. 1093</ref> Afterwards Legolas leaves Mirkwood to travel to Rivendell to attend the Council of Elrond and to report that Gollum has escaped.<ref>{{FR|Council}}, p. 255</ref>\n\nOn 11, 15 and 22 March {{TA|3019|n}},<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019, March 11, March 15 and March 22, pp. 1093-1094</ref> forces from Dol Guldur assaulted the realm of Lórien, but they were repulsed each time because of the valor of the Elves of Lórien and by the power of Galadriel, but the woods on the borders of Lórien were seriously damaged.<ref name=Great>{{App|Great}}, p. 1094</ref>\n\nOn 15 March {{TA|3019|n}}, the day of the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] in front of Minas Tirith,<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019, March 15, p. 1094</ref> forces from Dol Guldur invaded the realm of Thranduil in Mirkwood.

They divided the forest between them so that the realm of Thranduil encompassed the northern part of the wood down to the [[Mountains of Mirkwood]] and that the realm of Celeborn encompassed the southern part of the wood south of the [[Narrows of the Forest]], which was named East Lórien by Celeborn. Thranduil and Celeborn gave all the wide forest between the Mountains of Mirkwood and  the Narrows of the Forest to the [[Beornings]] and the [[Woodmen]].<ref name=Great/>\n\n=== Fourth Age ===\nThough initially they prospered as the darkness was lifted, the elves of the Wood of Greenleaves were destined either to depart for Valinor or fade into rustic forest spirits. The forest probably then ultimately fell under the dominion of Men, the descendants of the Beornings and the men of Dale.\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Mirkwood'' is an English name, which means \"gloomy wood\".

In its storyline, Celeborn and Galadriel organize a military campaign against Dol Guldur while the Fellowship still resides in Lothlorien (not to be confused with the later battle during the War of the Ring). The announced goal is to saw chaos into Orc forces by destroying as many of their troops, weapons and supplies as possible, to delay an inevitable assault upon Lothlorien. The true purpose, however, is to distract the Eye of Sauron from the company departing down the shores of Anduin. An assault by the Golden Host of the Galadhrim is successful despite minor losses and after establishing multiple camps throughout southern Mirkwood arrives at the walls of the fortress itself. However, without the White Lady they do not have the means of bringing down the walls, so the Elves prepare to swiftly fall back beyond Anduin before the main forces of the Enemy arrive.\n\n'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''\n:Mirkwood is the setting of one the missions in the game, where [[Eradan]], [[Farin]] and [[Andriel]] have to rescue [[Radagast|Radagast the Brown]] from a giant spider.\n\n'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:'''\n:Mirkwood is featured in the [[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug|second Hobbit film]], with its scenes being shot both on set in the studio and on location.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Taur-nu-Fuin (Dorthonion)]]\n{{references}}\n{{companyroute}}\n[[Category:Forests]]\n[[Category:Regions]]\n[[Category:Rhovanion]]\n[[de:Düsterwald]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/forets/rhovanion/foret noire]]\n[[fi:Synkmetsä]]"}}}
