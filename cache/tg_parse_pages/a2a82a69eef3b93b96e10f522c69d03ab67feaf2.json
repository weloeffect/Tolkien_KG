Now silent are those courts\nRuined the towers, whose old shape slowly fades\nAnd no feet pass beneath their broken ports\n\nI need no call of clamant bell that rings\nIron tongued in the towers of earthly kings\n\nTake a ride on, ride on,\non your rotting horse\non that deadly ground\nTake a ride, ride on,\non your rotting horse\nwith a pounding sound.\n\nHere on the stones and trees there lies a spell\nOf unforgotten loss, of memories more blest\nthan mortal wealth.\nHere undefeated dwell the fog immortal\nunder withered elmes,\nAlalminore one in ancient realms\n</poem>{{References}}\n[[Category:Songs by Summoning]]"}}}
