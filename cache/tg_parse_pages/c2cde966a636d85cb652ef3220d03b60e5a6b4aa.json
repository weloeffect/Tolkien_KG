The [[Corsairs]] attacked trade ships, fishing vessels, and the [[Gondorian Military Forces#Gondorian Naval Forces|Gondorian Navy]], as well as the Gondorian coast.  The Steward's most trusted counselor was a man the people called [[Thorongil]].   He was very concerned about what the Corsairs could do to the coasts, and voiced his worries often to Ecthelion.  Finally Ecthelion gave him permission to tackle this menace.<ref name=\"Gondor\">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>\n\n==The Attack==\nIn {{TA|2980|n}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> when all was prepared Thorongil led his small naval task force into the Gulf of Umbar to the Havens, and catching the Corsairs unprepared and unaware, they burned and destroyed many of their ships.  During the battle Thorongil slew the [[Captain of the Haven]] upon the quays, and then withdrew his forces with little loss.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThanks to the brilliance of Thorongil, the threat of [[Umbar]] was definitely diminished. Many of their ships were destroyed along with many of their sailors.  Thorongil would have received much praise and honor for his victory, but when the returning victors reached [[Pelargir]] he refused to return to [[Minas Tirith]].  He sent a message of farewell to [[Ecthelion II|Ecthelion]], saying: \"Other tasks now call me, lord, and much time and many perils must pass, ere I come again to Gondor, if that be my fate.\"  Though no one could guess what those tasks could be, or by whom he was summoned, they did know whither he went.  For he took a boat and crossed the [[Anduin]] river, and there he said farewell to his companions and went on alone; and when he was last seen he was headed toward the [[Ephel Dúath|Mountains of Shadow]].  This Thorongil turned out to be the young [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]].<ref name=\"Gondor\"/>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Conflicts of the Third Age]]"}}}
