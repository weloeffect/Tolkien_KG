They were repairing the wall on 8 March, when [[Gandalf]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] with Ingold’s permission passed into the townlands of [[Minas Tirith]] on their journey from [[Rohan]] to the city of Gondor.<ref>{{RK|MT}}</ref>\n\nLess than five days after Gandalf had passed through, an army from the [[Rhûn|East]] had crossed the River [[Anduin]] and broke the Rammas. Ingold’s guard was the last to escape from the host, reporting to Minas Tirith that the northward road had been taken by the enemy. Due to Ingold’s news, it was thought that the [[Rohirrim]] could not come to Gondor’s aid.<ref>{{RK|Siege}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n'''''[[Ingoldo]]''''', or ''i·[[Noldor|Ñoldo]]'', was the [[Amilessë|mothername]] of both [[Finarfin]] and his son [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]]. It became a frequently given name in [[Númenor]]; in the [[Third Age]] in Gondor, it was shortened to Ingold under influence of [[Westron]].<ref>{{PM|XINotes}}, p. 360, note 30</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Ingold in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game - Ingold.jpg|Ingold from [[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Ingold.jpg|Ingold in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n\n'''2001-2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'':'''\n:A Decipher card identifies one of the Gondorians of Minas Tirith in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' as Ingold.\n\n'''2015: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Ingold is first met defending the northern gate of [[Rammas Echor]] where he tasks the player with slowing the enemy's advance and repelling the attacks on the wall, but eventually retreats to Minas Tirith.

After King [[Aragorn|Elessar]] charges Steward [[Faramir]] with cleansing the evil of [[Minas Morgul]], Ingold and his men traverse the plateau of [[Gorgoroth]] and enter the [[Morgul Vale]] from the east.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:Dúnedain]]\n[[Category:Gondorians]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]"}}}
