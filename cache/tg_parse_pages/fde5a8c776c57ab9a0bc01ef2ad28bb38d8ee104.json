Its only small fertile region was called '''Raj''' (“Paradise”), and as such this name was also commonly used for the entire land. The river Rijesha flowed through the region. Bozisha-Dar, known as Harshport in the [[Westron|Common Speech]], was a major port city located at the place where the river met the sea. Its old cultural capital was Tresti, where the local cult of a moon goddess was centred around a well.\n\n:Far Harad was already a strong kingdom by the time the Númenóreans landed, though after its king was assassinated on the orders of [[Fifth of the Nazgûl|Akhôrahil]] of [[Ciryatanor]] it was ruled by a council of regents for thousands of years. For a long time, the region resisted Sauron, but by {{TA|2000}} a new cult arose that replaced traditional moon goddess worship with a new Sun God whose symbol was a [[Eye of Sauron|burning, lidless eye]]. The well of Tresti was sabotaged, and the city was abandoned in {{TA|2178}}. In {{TA|2194}}, Far Harad became a kingdom again under the cruel Sun Lords. Only after the [[Battle of the Morannon|defeat of Sauron]] was Tresti rebuilt and a new king crowned.<ref>{{ICE|3800}}, pp. 6-9</ref><ref>{{ICE|2026}}, pp. 66-68</ref> \n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Regions]]\n[[Category:Southern lands]]\n\n[[de:Weit-Harad]]\n[[fi:Taka-Harad]]"}}}
