The latter, named [[Elmar]], he wedded mostly against her wish and had many sons, of which the youngest was Hazad. Elmar warned Buldar, however,that though ehe was forced to live with him she would have her vengeance: [[Tal-Elmar|one]] of her bloodline would arise in Agar and bring about the downfall of Buldar's folk.<ref>{{PM|Elmar}}</ref>\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| BUL |y| ELM |~|~|~|~|~|~|y|~| HUS |BUL='''BULDAR'''<br /><small>''fl. {{SA}}''</small>|ELM=[[Elmar]]<br /><small>''fl. {{SA}}''</small>|HUS=''Unknown husband''<br /><small>''fl. {{SA}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| |,|-|^|-|.| | | | | | | |!| | | |}}\n{{familytree| CHI | | HAZ |y| WIF | | UNK | | | | |CHI=''Unknown children''|HAZ=[[Hazad Longbeard]]<br /><small>''fl. {{SA}}''</small>|WIF=''Unknown wife''<br /><small>''fl. {{SA}}''</small>|UNK=''Unknown children''}}\n{{familytree| | | | | |,|-|^|-|.| | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | | | SON | | TAL | | | | | | |SON=''Sixteen sons''|TAL=[[Tal-Elmar (character)|Tal-Elmar]]<br /><small>''fl. {{SA}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nIn a penciled note added to the manuscripts, J.R.R.
