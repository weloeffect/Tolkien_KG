I think it is v. kind indeed of you all the same to allow me to come and stay. I will be as little nuisance as possible (I know too much to suppose that I shall be none); and I resemble a hobbit at any rate in being moderately and cheerfully domesticated, though no cook. I cannot tell you how much I am looking forward to it, the first thoroughly agreeable prospect I have had since I was ill in October I suppose George got back safely after his astonishing dash to O. and back! I can only hope that the cargo proved worth the effort. Still I cannot really fear that, if your appetite (and his) could last so long, it will not find plenty to its taste in the second half. It's pretty well a crescendo until at least [[The Field of Cormallen|Chap. 4 of the last \"book\"]]. It is on the rallentando and coda [i.e. the winding down of the story, and the hobbits' return to the Shire] that I am specially anxious for your opinion.|J.R.R.
