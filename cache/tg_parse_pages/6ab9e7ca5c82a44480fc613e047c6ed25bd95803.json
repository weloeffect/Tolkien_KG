Tolkien’s Middle-earth contains a rich assortment of people, cities, and creatures – as well as a deep, intertwined history that spans thousands of years. In this beautifully illustrated, leather-bound volume, best-selling author and Tolkien scholar David Day presents four decades of research and writing on the lands and inhabitants Middle-earth. Sections of this A-to-Z dictionary are devoted to discussion of the battles, history, beasts, and heroes of Tolkien’s stories, and are accompanied by black-and-white illustrations. This comprehensive volume on Tolkien’s world also includes an appendix of three primary legends that served as sources for Tolkien’s creations – the Volsunga saga, the Nibelungenlied, and Richard Wagner’s Ring Cycle—and more than 200 black-and-white illustrations.}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Encyclopedia of Tolkien, An}}\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Books by David Day]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]"}}}
