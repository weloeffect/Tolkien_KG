He awakes and appears to be second-guessing his plan to lead them to ''her'', before [[Gollum]] reminds him they will be able to take the ring back for themselves. As Sam awakes, he hears Sméagol's plan to take the ring ''\"once the Hobbitses are dead\"''. In a rage, Sam attacks him. Frodo awakes and Sam tells him that Gollum means to murder them. Knowing they need a guide to get to [[Mordor]], Frodo refuses to send Gollum away. \n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King scenes|06]]"}}}
