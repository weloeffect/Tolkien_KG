Tolkien's fictional world of Middle-earth is filled with an ongoing struggle between good and evil, centered on a set of rings forged by Elves and an evil sorcerer. The Ring Legends of Tolkien recounts stories and conflicts surrounding the Rings of Power. Insightful commentary by Tolkien scholar David Day discusses how people, tactics, and weapons were used to obtain and control the rings, and also how the legends of Middle-earth relate to the real-world mythology on which Tolkien based his famous literary creation. Maps and full-color illustrations help bring this rich universe to life, making it an invaluable reference book for Tolkien fans of all ages.}}\n\n{{title|italics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ring Legends of Tolkien}}\n[[Category:Books by David Day]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]"}}}
