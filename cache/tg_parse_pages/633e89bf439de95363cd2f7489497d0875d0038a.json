During the scouting expedition to the [[Front Gate]] of the Lonely Mountain the crows were considered \"ominous\" and [[Balin]] distrusted them,<ref>{{H|Doorstep}}</ref> though later he called them merely \"nasty suspicious-looking creatures at that, and rude as well\".<ref>{{H|Gathering}}</ref>\n\nThe most feared variety in the [[Westlands]] of [[Middle-earth]] was the large type known as ''[[crebain]]''.  On [[8 January]] {{TA|3019|n}} the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]] entered [[Hollin]]<ref name=\"Great\">{{App|Great}}</ref> and were spied upon by these large crows from [[Fangorn Forest|Fangorn]] and [[Dunland]].<ref>{{FR|II3}}</ref>  The [[Rohirrim]] were aware that [[Saruman]] made use of ''crebain''; on [[30 February]]<ref name=\"Great\"/> [[Éomer]] told [[Aragorn]] that Saruman's \"birds of ill omen are abroad in the sky\".<ref>{{TT|III2}}</ref> Crows may actually just be another name for Ravens as they looked and acted exactly the same. (Balin certainly distinguished between them, preferring Ravens over Crows.)\n\n==Etymology==\nA [[Quenya]] word for \"crow\" is ''quáko'', derived from [[Primitive Quendian]] ''k(a)wāk''.<ref>{{WJ|AD}}, p. 395</ref> Another Quenya word for \"crow\" is ''korko'', and the [[Noldorin]] cognate of the same meaning is ''corch''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 362 (root [[KORKA|KARKA-]])</ref> In [[Gnomish]], one of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s very early conceptions of an [[Elvish|Elven]] language, the word for \"crow\" is ''crunc'' (pl. ''crunghin'').<ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 27</ref>\n\n[[Adûnaic]] also had its own terms for a crow, specifically  ''khô'' in \"common\" gender singular (\"crow\", as a species/creature), the plural ''khôi'' (\"crows\"), and the dual (pair-plural) ''khôwat'' (\"a pair of crows\"). Tolkien's notes on Adûnaic vocabulary and grammar also indicate that the more archaic forms of the term were likely ''khaw'', later ''khâw'', eventually evolving into ''khâu'' (with the Adûnaic diphtong ''âu''), while the plural of these older forms would apparently be ''khâwî(m)''. However, both ''khâu'' and ''khâwî(m)'' would likely be declensions in the subjective case of the noun, rather than in the nominative case. The objective case of the noun would be ''khôwu''.<ref>{{SD|3}}, p. 426</ref><ref>[https://folk.uib.no/hnohf/adunaic.htm Adûnaic - The Vernacular of Númenór], \"Adûnaic Wordlist\", Ardalambion (folk.uib.no) by Helge Fauskanger</ref><ref>[https://eldamo.org/content//words/word-2014215641.html Adûnaic - \"khô\"], \"Adûnaic Words\", Eldamo.org by Paul Strack</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s plot notes for the second phase of writing ''[[The Hobbit]]'', there was no distinction between crows and ravens as ominous birds.<ref>{{HH|PNB}}, p. 362</ref>  When the scouting party went to view the [[Front Gate]] [[Balin]] did not like the ravens nearby, stating that they looked \"like spies of evil\".<ref>{{HH|Lonely}}, p. 472</ref>  However, when the Company needed to learn of the death of [[Smaug]] Tolkien \"rehabilitated\" the ravens, making them friendly to the Dwarves, and replaced all negative raven-references with crows.<ref>{{HH|Lonely}}, note 4, p. 479</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Gorcrows]]\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Birds]]\n[[Category:Servants of Melkor]]\n[[Category:Servants of Saruman]]\n[[Category:Servants of Saruman]]\n[[de:Krähen]]\n[[fi:Varikset]]"}}}
