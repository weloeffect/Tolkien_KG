He was also one of two companions (along with [[Ulbar]]) who rode with the prince after the voyage in {{SA|882}} as they journeyed to the [[White House]] of Aldarion's wife [[Erendis]].  While Ulbar rode on to his home in [[Hyarastorni]], Henderch stayed the night, but was awakened early by Aldarion.  Due to Erendis' cold reception Aldarion angrily decided to ride on to the home of his kinsman.\n\nAfter witnessing Aldarion's leave-taking from his wife and daughter [[Tar-Ancalimë|Ancalimë]], Henderch rode with him to Hallatan's.  As they drew near, he and Aldarion beheld the happy homecoming that Ulbar's wife had prepared for her husband.  As the prince's mood grew bitter he changed his mind and did not ride on to the house of Hallatan.  Instead he determined to return to [[Armenelos]].  He bade Henderch farewell so that he might ride on alone.  Henderch said that it was not fitting; Aldarion agreed but did so anyway.  Thus it was Henderch who witnessed the final meeting between Aldarion and Erendis.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nHenderch's name is [[Sindarin]] but difficult to translate.
