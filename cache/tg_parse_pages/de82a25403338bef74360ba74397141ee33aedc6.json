It appears in their first full-lenght album, [[...Where the Shadows Lie]], released in [[2002]].\n==Lyrics==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nThe southern end of the Misty Mountains \nWaters of Entwash and Limlight \nThere it stands, the mighty wood of great age \nHiding secrets from the early years \nOnce so green and great that it reached \nAll over the Eriador \nHuge tracts of lost lands \nBeleriand covered by this great vast forest \n\nCreatures hiding in the deepest shadows \nKeeping the darkest ones away \nGreat guardians, fathers of woods \nDefending their ancient pride \nLong ago they wandered the land \nNowadays there's left only a few \nOthers crushed by the armies of unlight \n\nIn Fangorn there lives the eldest one \nThe eldest of the ents \nThis forest named after him \nFangorn, Treebeard \n\nThe guardian of his lands \nThe oldest being in Arda \nSo much evil he has seen \nSo much shadows in his dreams \nWith his heart full of grief \nHe trusts and still believes \nTo his kingdom so serene \nFor his entlings and him \n\nHear me my fellow ents \nIt's time to march into the battle \nThe evil has raped our lands too much \nSo many brothers gone by the darkness \n\nEvery orc under the banner of the hand \nWill be crushed by our hate and anger \nEvery Uruk who stands against our power \nWill be teared apart form his life \nThe white hand of Saruman \nAll his glory soon beaten down \nAll the walls and towers of Isengard \nDestroyed by the entish wrath \nDie, die uruk-hai! \n\nThe war is over and all is silent \nRavens fly to Isengard \nTall creatures with the shape of a tree \nMarching north with victory \nTheir work is now finished \nEnts have crushed their enemy \nDead uruk's every where \nReign of Saruman gone for good\n\n</poem>\n[[Category:Songs by Battlelore]]"}}}
