It was especially notable during the time [[Túrin Turambar]] spent in Brethil and as the location of [[Haudh-en-Elleth]], the burial mound of Finduilas.\n\nThe Crossings of Taeglin was also the most well-known location of the [[Drúedain]]'s [[watch-stones|watch-stone]] statues, each depicting a large Drúadan squatting over a dead [[Orc]].<ref>{{UT|Druedain}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[Haladin]] travelled westward in search of a new home until they came to the Forest of Brethil, which at that time was claimed by King [[Thingol]]. Thanks to [[Finrod Felagund]]'s negotiations on their behalf, Thingol agreed to grant Brethil to [[Haleth]] and her people on the condition that they guard the Crossings of Taeglin.<ref>{{S|West}}</ref>\n\nOverly open tactics deployed from [[Nargothrond]] by Túrin and the [[Elves of Nargothrond|Elves]] revealed its location to Morgoth. In {{FA|495}}, messengers came to the city and warned that Orcs were gathering in the [[Pass of Sirion]].<ref name=\"SilmOfTurin\">{{S|21}}</ref> The Crossings of Taeglin were situated at a pivotal center point on the road south from the Pass, separating the region from Nargothrond.<ref name=\"SilmMap\" /> Shortly after the messengers left the city, Orcs invaded Brethil in order to secure the Crossings for their southward advance. The Men of Brethil fought against the invasion, but [[Handir]] Lord of Brethil was slain and the defeated Men retreated into the forest. The Orcs, now in control of the Crossings, continued strengthening their forces in the Pass of Sirion.<ref>{{CH|11}}</ref>\n\nThe forces of Morgoth were unleashed from the north and [[Fall of Nargothrond|Nargothrond fell]]. Many Elves of the fallen city were rounded up by the Orcs to be slaves of [[Angband]], including [[Finduilas]] daughter of the slain King [[Orodreth]] and close friend of Túrin. On their way to Angband, the Orcs were stopped at the Crossings of Taeglin where they were attacked by Men of Brehtil. However, the Orcs killed their captives before they could be rescued and the Men found Finduilas pinned to a tree. A month later, Túrin, who had been searching for Finduilas, learned about her death from [[Dorlas]] and the other Men of Brethil. They brought him to the mound next to the Crossings where her body was buried, which they named [[Haudh-en-Elleth]], and he fell to the ground in despair. Then Túrin stayed with the Men in Brethil and prevented Orcs from using the Crossings while he guarded the mound of Finduilas. During this time, the Orcs learned to fear the Crossings of Taeglin and refused to draw near.<ref>{{CH|13}}</ref>\n\n[[Nienor]], in search of shelter after losing her memory from a spell of [[Glaurung]], entered the Forest of Brethil over the Crossings of Taeglin. Meanwhile, Túrin came to the Crossings to look for Orcs and found her collapsed on Haudh-en-Elleth. Three years later,<ref>{{GA|315, 322}}</ref> Túrin went out to find and kill Glaurung. Nienor became fearful and went after him. When she approached the Crossings and saw Haudh-en-Elleth, a feeling of dread came over her and she ran along the river until coming to the bodies of both Glaurung and Túrin. Finally released from Glaurung’s spell and wrongly believing that Túrin had died, she cast herself into the river over the [[Cabed-en-Aras]].<ref name=\"SilmOfTurin\" />\n\nMadness came over Túrin when he learned what had happened and he went to the mound of Finduilas, crying for her counsel. It was then that [[Mablung]] with a company of Elves of [[Doriath]] came over the Crossing of Taeglin and found him there. However, Túrin ran from them before throwing himself on his sword.<ref name=\"SilmOfTurin\" />\n\nAfter the deaths of Nienor and Túrin, their father [[Húrin]] was released from Morgoth’s captivity. He eventually came to the Crossings of Taeglin and found the [[Stone of the Hapless|memorial stone]] for his children at the place where they died. [[Morwen]] his wife was there waiting for him. They spoke one last time before she died and he made a grave for her near the grave of their children. Then he left over the Crossings, wandering towards the ruins of Nargothrond.<ref>{{S|22}}</ref> \n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Beleriand]]\n[[Category:Roads and streets]]\n[[Category:Fords]]\n[[de:Teiglin-Stege]]\n[[fi:Teiglinin ylityspaikka]]"}}}
