He was the father of [[Peregrin Took]].\n\n==History==\n===Family===\nPaladin was born in {{SR|1333}} being the son and heir of [[Adalgrim Took]], and a great-grandchild of the [[Gerontius Took|Old Took]]. He married [[Eglantine Banks]], and they had several children together: [[Pearl Took|Pearl]] (born {{SR|1375|n}}) followed by [[Pimpernel Took|Pimpernel]] ({{SR|1379|n}}) and [[Pervinca Took|Pervinca]] ({{SR|1385|n}}). [[Peregrin Took|Peregrin]] ({{SR|1390|n}}) was younger, but would be Paladin's heir.<ref name=\"Took\">{{App|Took}}</ref>\n\n===Becoming Thain===\nPaladin was a direct descendant of the [[Gerontius Took|Old Took]], one of his great grandsons. He was member of a junior branch of the Took family, where [[Hildigrim Took|Hildigrim]] was head of that branch.<ref name=\"Took\"/> He became a farmer, farming the lands around [[Whitwell]] near [[Tuckborough]].<ref>{{RK|MT}}</ref> Never did he expect to become Thain as at the time of his birth the Thainship was in the hands of, [[Isumbras Took IV|Isumbras IV]], his great uncle. Isumbras IV's succession appeared secure since he had both a son and grandson, [[Fortinbras Took II|Fortinbras II]] and [[Ferumbras Took III|Ferumbras III]]. However, Ferumbras III died without an heir in {{SR|1415}} and Fortinbras II had had no other sons, so the Thainship passed to Paladin, the most senior male-line relative.<ref name=\"L214\">{{L|214}}</ref> \n\nIn {{SR|1401}} he attended [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]] with his children.<ref name=\"Took\"/>\n\n===War of the Ring===\nPaladin never agreed with [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]]' attempt to take over [[the Shire]] as he believed that if anyone were going to the \"Chief\" it should be the legitimate [[Thain of the Shire]], therefore Paladin and the other Tooks stood up to Lotho and his [[Ruffians]]. The [[Took Family|Took]]s hid in their deep dwellings of [[Great Smials]], and the ruffians could not get them, and if any ruffians were found in the [[Tookland]] they were shot and killed, an act which led the ruffians to become harsher.<ref name=\"Scouring\">{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>\n\nAt this time, Paladin's son [[Peregrin Took|Peregrin]] and [[Travellers|three other hobbits]], were lost in the [[Old Forest]] by all accounts. Their return was unexpected, but Paladin fully embraced their suggestion to drive out the Ruffians. He sent a hundred Tooks with his son to the [[Battle of Bywater]], and commanded the remainder of his troops cleaning up the area south of the village.<ref name=\"Scouring\"/>\n\n===Death===\nPaladin died in {{SR|1434}} at the age of 101, and after having been Thain for nineteen years, he was succeeded by his son who became Thain Peregrin I.<ref name=\"Took\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Paladin'' is derived from Latin ''palatinus'', which means \"palace officer\".<ref name=\"IE\">{{HM|IE}}, The Giving of Names, p. 192</ref> It was used for the twelve peers of [[wikipedia:Charlemagne|Charlemagne]],<ref name=\"IE\"/> the emperor of the [[wikipedia:Carolingian Empire|Carolingian Empire]], an empire in Western and Central Europe that was dominated by the [[wikipedia:Franks|Franks]].\n\nA \"[[wikipedia:Paladin|paladin]]\" is a high office which existed in medieval Europe - which entered into many tales - and was a noble office held by an honourable and valiant knight.\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start|style=white-space: nowrap;}}\n{{familytree | | | | | OLD | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |OLD=[[Gerontius Took|The Old Took]]<br/><small>''{{SR|1190|n}} - {{SR|1320|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|-|-|.| | | | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | ISE | | ISU | | | | HIL |y|ROS  | | | | | | |ISE=[[Isengrim Took III|Isengrim III]]<br/><small>''{{SR|1232|n}} - {{SR|1330|n}}''</small>|ISU=[[Isumbras Took IV|Isumbras IV]]<br/><small>''{{SR|1238|n}} - {{SR|1339|n}}''</small>|HIL=[[Hildigrim Took|Hildigrim]]<br/><small>''{{SR|1240|n}} - {{SR|1341|n}}''</small>|ROS=[[Rosa Baggins]]<br/><small>''{{SR|1256|n}} - unknown''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |!| | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | FOR | | | | | | ADA | | | | | | | | |FOR=[[Fortinbras Took II|Fortinbras II]]<br/><small>''{{SR|1278|n}} - {{SR|1380|n}}''</small>|ADA=[[Adalgrim Took|Adalgrim]]<br/><small>''{{SR|1280|n}} - {{SR|1382|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |!| | | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | FER | | DAU | | PAL |y| EGL | | ESM | FER=[[Ferumbras Took III|Ferumbras III]]<br/><small>''{{SR|1316|n}} - {{SR|1415|n}}''</small>|DAU=''3 daughters''|PAL='''PALADIN II'''<br/><small>''{{SR|1333|n}} - {{SR|1434|n}}''</small>|ESM=[[Esmeralda Took|Esmeralda]]<br/><small>''{{SR|1336|n}} - unknown''</small>|EGL=[[Eglantine Banks]]<br/><small>''unknown''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | |,|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|(| | | | | |!| |}}\n{{familytree | | | PEA | | PIM | | PER | | PIP | | | | MER | PEA=[[Pearl Took|Pearl]]<br/><small>''{{SR|1375|n}} - unknown''</small>|PIM=[[Pimpernel Took|Pimpernel]]<br/><small>''{{SR|1379|n}} - unknown''</small>|PER=[[Pervinca Took|Pervinca]]<br/><small>''{{SR|1385|n}} - unknown''</small>|PIP=[[Peregrin Took|Peregrin I]]<br/><small>''{{SR|1390|n}} - {{SR|1484|n}}+''</small>|MER=[[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Meriadoc]]<br/><small>''{{SR|1382|n}} - {{SR|1484|n}}+''</small>|DA2=''3 daughters''}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Paladin Took II in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:PaladinTook.jpg|''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\nFile:Paladin Took II - The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying.jpg|''[[The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying]]''\n</gallery>\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Thain Paladin Took II is found at the [[Great Smials]] in [[Tuckborough]].
