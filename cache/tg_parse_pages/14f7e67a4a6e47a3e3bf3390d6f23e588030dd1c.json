As they came within (what they thought) a days journey to the feet of the [[Misty Mountains]], [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] asked \"Is that ''The'' Mountain?\". [[Balin]] explained that the Mountains ahead were merely one obstacle in the path towards the [[Lonely Mountain]].\n\n[[Gandalf]] informed the party that hidden somewhere before them was the valley of [[Rivendell]] and that he had told his Elf-friends to expect their arrival. Gandalf led the way on a path - it seems - he knew very well. Just as the Dwarves and Bilbo were growing anxious, they came across unexpected valleys. Gandalf continued to lead them and eventually they saw a fair valley far below them. Following a slippery journey down a zigzag path they entered Rivendell, where the Elves greeted them with song and laughter from within the trees.\n\nAt last they came to the [[Rivendell|Last Homely House]],<ref>Around [[15 June|June 15]] {{TA|2941}} or earlier</ref> where they stayed (quite happily) for at least fourteen days. \n\nOn midsummer eve,<ref>[[Lithedays|1 Lithe]]</ref> [[Elrond]] inspected the swords which [[Thorin]] and Gandalf had acquired from the [[Trolls' cave]]. The runes on Thorin's sword named it [[Orcrist]], the Goblin-cleaver; the runes on Gandalf's sword read [[Glamdring]], Foe-hammer - both were ancient blades forged in [[Gondolin]]. Elrond then inspected [[Thrór's Map]], he found Moon letters which read: \"Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks, and the setting sun with the last light of [[Durin's Day]] will shine upon the keyhole.\"\n\nOn [[Mid-year's Day]]'s morning, the adventurers departed from Rivendell for the Misty Mountains and the land beyond.\n{{References}}\n[[Category:The Hobbit chapters|Short Rest]]\n[[de:Eine kurze Rast]]\n[[fi:Lyhyt lepo]]"}}}
