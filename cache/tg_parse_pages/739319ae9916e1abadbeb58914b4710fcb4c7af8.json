Tolkien’s maps of The Hobbit, Beleriand, Middle-earth and Númenor – re-illustrated by John Howe – are presented as full colour foldout posters and accompanied by a richly detailed text by Brian Sibley.\n\nEach poster-sized foldout map has been re-imagined in full colour by John Howe, the world-renowned Tolkien artist who has worked on Peter Jackson’s Academy Award-winning Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Rings of Power TV series as well as the forthcoming Warner Bros animated film, The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim.\n\nThe maps are accompanied by a fascinating and authoritative, fully illustrated 160-page text written by Brian Sibley, author of the Sunday Times bestselling The Fall of Númenor and leading expert on The Lord of the Rings (he adapted the work for the acclaimed 1981 BBC radio dramatisation), which recounts the story behind each map and provides a richly detailed glossary of every name, place and event.\n\nDesigned to complement the growing range of hardback editions of J.R.R. Tolkien’s work, this brand new edition is the perfect companion for every fan wishing to learn more about the world of Tolkien’s Middle-earth.}}\n\n{{Publishedmajorbooks}}\n{{title|italics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Maps of Middle-earth, The}}\n[[Category:Map books]]\n[[Category:Fiction books]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
