This scene was not featured in the theatrical release of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Gandalf]] and [[Pippin]] ride to stop the burning of [[Faramir]] at the hands of [[Denethor]], but are waylaid by the [[Witch-king]] riding atop a [[fell beast]]. The wizard commands that he go back to the abyss, however, the [[Nazgûl]] mocks him and says to him ''\"This is my hour\"''. Pippin draws his sword but screams at the shriek of the Ringwraith, and Gandalf is thrown off [[Shadowfax]] as his staff is broken; the wizard appears doubtful and defeated as the Witch-king tells him ''\"You have failed. The world of Men will fall\"''. As the black captain raises his sword at Gandalf, the horns of [[Rohan]] sound loudly in the distance. Rohan had come. He pauses, before flying away upon the fell beast. \n\n==Differences==\nThe encounter between Gandalf and the Witch-king in the books occurs immediately after [[Grond (battering ram)|Grond]] is used to break the [[Great Gate of Minas Tirith|Gate of Gondor]].<ref name=\"RK Siege p. 829\"/> The dialogue between the two characters follows the books closely, however the two do not engage in any conflict (for example, the breaking of Gandalf's staff does not occur), and Gandalf shows no fear of the Lord of the Nazgûl.<ref name=\"RK Siege p. 829\">{{RK|Siege}}, p. 829</ref> Furthermore, Pippin was not with Gandalf during the encounter.<ref>{{RK|Pyre}}, p. 850</ref> \n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King scenes|45]]"}}}
