It contains [[:File:J.R.R. Tolkien - A Spring Harvest Note.png|a prefatory note]] by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. \n\n==History==\nThe poems were edited by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. Despite some claims to the contrary,<ref>[[John Garth]], ''[[Tolkien and the Great War]]'', \"Tol Withernon and Fladweth Amrod\", page 246</ref> [[Christopher Wiseman]] was not involved in editing. He later told [[John D. Rateliff]] he was credited alongside Tolkien at the latter's request, since they were the only two surviving members of the \"Great Four\".<ref name=\"Biblio\">[[Wayne G. Hammond]], [[Douglas A. Anderson]], ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography]]'', \"Books Edited, Translated, or with Contributions by J.R.R. Tolkien\", B3: A Spring Harvest</ref>\n\nSeveral fragments of the poems were reproduced in [[John Garth]]'s ''[[Tolkien and the Great War]]'', who notes that while this collection predated the flurry of soldier's poetry - much of it published by Erskine - it had the same disenchantment and desillusion as most others.<ref>[[John Garth]], ''[[Tolkien and the Great War]]'', \"Postscript. 'One who dreams alone'\", pages 301-3</ref> Also, some poems were reproduced in [[Mark Atherton]]'s book ''[[There and Back Again: J.R.R. Tolkien and the Origins of The Hobbit]]''. Atherton notes that [[Douglas A. Anderson]] is currently working on a new edition of ''A Spring Harvest''.<ref>[[Mark Atherton]], ''[[There and Back Again: J.R.R.
