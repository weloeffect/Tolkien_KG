Art by [[:Category:Images by Amani Warrington|Amani Warrington]]]]\n{{quote|Now the Valar took to themselves shape and hue; and because they were drawn into the World by love of the Children of Ilúvatar, for whom they hoped, they took shape after that manner which they had beheld in the [[Vision of Ilúvatar]], save only in majesty and splendour. Moreover their shape comes of their knowledge of the visible World, rather than of the World itself; and they need it not, save only as we use raiment, and yet we may be naked and suffer no loss of our being. Therefore the Valar may walk, if they will, unclad, and then even the [[Eldar]] cannot clearly perceive them, though they be present. But when they desire to clothe themselves the Valar take upon them forms some as of male and some as of female; for that difference of temper they had even from their beginning, and it is but bodied forth in the choice of each, not made by the choice, even as with us male and female may be shown by the raiment but is not made thereby.|[[Ainulindalë]]}}\n\n'''''Fana''''' is a [[Quenya]] term used to describe the physical form which is taken on by the [[Ainur]] when they desire to have tangible bodies.<ref name=Notes>{{RGEO|Notes}}, pp. 60, 66</ref> \n\nUnlike the [[Children of Ilúvatar]], the Ainur take on a body by choice, wearing or going without physical form as mortals wear or can go without clothing.<ref name=ai>{{S|Ainu}}</ref> Being inherently spiritual beings, ''[[ëalar]]'', they did not need material bodies to be whole in that fashion that ''[[fëar]]'', the spiritual component of [[Incarnate]]s, need to be joined with ''[[hröar]]''.<ref name=MR>{{MR|P3I3}}, p. 165 (commentary on §18)</ref> \n\nThis physical form equivalent to the ''hröa'' is known as a ''fana'', which originally meant \"veil, raiment\".<ref name=Notes /> However, the ''fana'' differs much from the ''hröa'': it does not belong to the nature of the Ainur, even when it is also made of physical matter. Thus the High Elves personally knew that the ''fanar'' were not illusions, but a physical way that the Valar had to communicate with them.<ref name=Eldarin>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 179</ref> \n\nAlthough the Ainur are angelic beings of spirit, they each possess a specific gender, male or female, and this gender is part of who they are regardless of whether or not they take on a ''fana''. When they do take on a physical form it is a representation of their gender. [[Manwë|Manwë Súlimo]], for example, takes for himself a ''fana'' in the form of a male, that of a great king. His wife, [[Varda|Varda Elentári]] clothes herself with the ''fana'' in the form of a great and beautiful queen.<ref name=Valaquenta>{{S|IIb}}</ref> A more known example are the [[Istari]], who came to [[Middle-earth]] with the ''fanar'' of old wise men.<ref name=Eldarin />\n\nMost of the Ainur do assume a physical body, but some of the them, such as [[Ulmo]], rarely assume a physical form.<ref name=Valaquenta /> Sometimes an Ainu can be hurt or injured to the point they are limited or unable to assume a physical form. For example, after [[Sauron]] was caught in the [[Downfall of Númenor]], he was unable to ever take on a fair form again; and after his loss of [[the One Ring]] at the end of the [[Second Age]], he was not able to take any physical shape for many years.<ref>{{S|IV}}</ref>\n\nIn one description, the ''fanar'' of the great Valar were said by the Eldar who had dwelt in Valinor usually to have had a stature far greater than that of the tallest Elves, and when performing some great deed or rite, or issuing commands, to have assumed an awe-inspiring height.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 175</ref> In another, they presented themselves in the forms of Elves and Men (though they could assume other and wholly alien shapes), and appeared usually as persons of majestic (but not gigantic) stature; the High Elves said that these forms were always in some degree, variable according to the occasion, 'radiant', as if a light from within suffused the ''fanar''.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 180</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Concepts]]\n[[Category:Quenya nouns]]"}}}
