The Ringwraiths' breath was poisonous and could overpower those affected by it.\n\nThis evil blight caused their victims to slip into a dark cold sleep and never recover. Those stricken by the malady murmured in their sleep until a grey shadow fell on their faces as they fell into the darkness.\n\n==History==\nAfter the [[Witch-king]] led [[Sauron's attack on Osgiliath]], news of a \"Black Shadow\" reached [[Eriador]] and [[Gandalf]] felt a sense of dread.<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref>\n\nIn the evening of [[29 September]] {{TA|3018}},<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3018 September 29</ref> [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] left [[the Prancing Pony]] and went for a stroll in [[Bree]]. He saw and followed (or was drawn by) a dark shadow, but then fell unconscious. [[Aragorn|Strider]] stated that Merry had been overcome by the Black Breath.<ref>{{FR|Strider}}, pp. 172-3</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Siege of Gondor]] many were wounded and those stricken by the Black Shadow were brought to the [[Houses of Healing]], but the healers could not find a remedy. In the last retreat before the city of [[Minas Tirith]] was besieged, [[Faramir]] fell under the shadow while fighting to hold his outpost, and after being struck with an arrow was brought to the Houses of Healing on [[13 March]] {{TA|3019|n}}.<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019 March 13</ref><ref>{{RK|Siege}}, p. 810</ref> It appears that both Merry and [[Éowyn]] were exposed to the Black Breath when they fought the [[Witch-king]] during the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]<ref>{{RK|Battle}}, p. 841</ref> on [[15 March]] {{TA|3019|n}}.<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019 March 15</ref> Later on that day after the battle Aragorn came to the [[Houses of Healing]] and recognized that Faramir was suffering from the Black Breath. Aragorn used ''[[athelas]]'' to cure Faramir, Éowyn, Merry and others who had been hurt by the Black Breath. This led to the rapidly spread news that the King had returned.<ref>{{RK|Houses}}, p. 860-871</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Magic]]\n[[Category:Nazgûl]]\n[[de:Schwarzer Anhauch]]\n[[fi:Musta Hengitys]]"}}}
