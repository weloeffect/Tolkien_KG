Waldreg was invented for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'' by [[Amazon Studios]], where he was portrayed by [[Geoff Morrell]].<ref>{{webcite|author=The Lord of the Rings on Prime|articleurl=https://twitter.com/PrimeVideo/status/1559940412114083841|articlename=Get to know the Southlanders in #TheRingsOfPower\n|dated=17 August 2022|website=[https://twitter.com/ Twitter]|accessed=17 August 2022}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nWaldreg worshipped [[Sauron]] secretly, and wished for his return to [[Middle-earth]]. Under the instruction of [[Adar (The Rings of Power)|Adar]], he activated a mechanism at the [[Watchtower of Ostirith]], which caused a flood of water to flow into the volcano [[Mount Doom|Orodruin]]. As a result, the volcano erupted, destroying the Southlands and effectively creating the land of [[Mordor]].<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'', \"[[Udûn (episode)|Udûn]]\"</ref><ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'', \"[[The Eye]]\"</ref>\n\nWaldreg later taunted a captive Sauron, whom he believed to be [[Halbrand]]. After leaving Sauron with a [[Wargs|Warg]], Sauron spoke to the Warg using the [[Black Speech]] and ordered it to kill Waldreg. The old man was later devoured by the Warg.\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Men from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) characters]]"}}}
