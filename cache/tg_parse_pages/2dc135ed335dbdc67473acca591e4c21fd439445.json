Most commonly, they were used to represent vowel-sounds, since [[Tengwar|Fëanorian script]] as it was commonly used did not provide characters to represent vowels.  However, some of the tehtar were used to abbreviate writing, such as a bar above a consonant that added a preceding nasal of the same ''[[Témar|téma]]'', or a bar below that indicated consonantal doubling, or a downward hook added to the bow that meant a following 's' (especially favoured in [[Quenya]]).<ref>{{App|Letters}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Lettering]]\n[[Category:Quenya nouns]]"}}}
