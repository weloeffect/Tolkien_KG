Art by [[John Howe]]]]\n'''Westlands''' was a large part of [[Middle-earth]], perhaps referring to the entire north-western region of the wide continent.<ref>{{App|Durin}}, p. 1080</ref><ref>{{App|Languages}}, p. 1127</ref>\n\nOccasionally it may also be used more specifically as a name of [[Eriador]].<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}, p. 4</ref><ref>{{App|SA}}, entry for the year 1701, p. 1083</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe Westlands were the most well known and documented part of Middle-earth, the north-western part of the continent facing [[Belegaer]]. It consisted of huge regions of land, such as [[Beleriand]]/[[Lindon]], [[Eriador]], [[Rhovanion]], [[Gondor]], and [[Mordor]]. The most extreme regions of the Westlands (that perhaps did not belong to them) were alien lands such as [[Rhûn]], [[Harad]], and [[Khand]]. Beyond them, unknown lands lay to the [[East]] and [[South (disambiguation)|South]].{{Fact}}\n\nOf the Westlands, the western portion called Beleriand was drowned at the end of the First Age, and survivors relocated to Lindon and Eriador. Eriador, now the westernmost part of Middle-earth, was bordered by the [[Misty Mountains]] to the East which stretched down south to the [[White Mountains]] and the [[Bay of Belfalas]].{{Fact}}\n\nAcross the Misty Mountains from Eriador was another region of the Westlands, Rhovanion. It extended east to the [[Sea of Rhûn]]. Within Rhovanion, there were the great forest of [[Mirkwood]], [[Fangorn Forest]], and [[Lothlórien]]. To the south was the region of Mordor, encircled on three sides by mountains. To the far north of Rhovanion and Eriador alike was the icy [[Forodwaith (lands)|Forodwaith]].{{Fact}}\n\nThe southern part of the Westlands was around the Bay of Belfalas, including the area of Gondor.{{Fact}}\n\n==History==\nIn the [[Elder Days]], most of the Westlands were covered by an immense forest.<ref>{{FR|Council}}; \"Time was once when a squirrel could carry a nut from tree to tree from Rivendell to the Great Sea...\"</ref>\n\nThe Westlands were populated by almost all known races of Middle-earth: [[Elves]] ([[Eldar]]) and [[Men]] who stayed behind on their way to the [[West]], and who later escaped the destruction of [[Beleriand]]. [[Dwarves]], [[Orcs]] and [[Ents]] also made their realms all over the Westlands.{{Fact}}\n\nDuring the [[Second Age]], many [[Númenóreans]] came and established their settlements. It was then when the huge forests begen to shrink as trees were used to build their ships.<ref>{{UT|Aldarion}}</ref> The [[Fangorn Forest]] and the [[Old Forest]] were the remnants of those days.{{Fact}}\n\nThe Númenórean Realms in Exile, [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]], dominated the Westlands during the Second and [[Third Age]]s. Eventually, most of the Mannish peoples of the Westlands were brought together under the [[Reunited Kingdom]]. Their first King, [[Aragorn|Elessar]], was titled \"Lord of the Westlands\" in the [[Fourth Age]].<ref name=\"KL\" />\n\n==Other names==\nIn the [[Sindarin]] [[King's Letter]], the term \"Westlands\" is translated as '''''i Mbair Annui'''''.<ref name=\"KL\">{{SD|XI}}, pp. 128-9</ref>\n\n==Bays and islands==\n*[[Tol Morwen]]\n*[[Tol Fuin]]\n*[[Himling]]\n*[[Tolfalas]], in the Bay of Belfalas\n*[[Icebay of Forochel]]\n*[[Gulf of Lune]]\n*[[Bay of Belfalas]]\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''1989: ''[[J.R.R.
