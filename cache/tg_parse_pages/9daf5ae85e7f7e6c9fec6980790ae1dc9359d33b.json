It stretched from the [[Firienholt|Firien Wood]] to the confluence of the Mering Sream with the river [[Entwash]], and was therefore located along a part of Rohan's eastern border with [[Gondor]].<ref name=\"Map\">{{RK|Map}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Fenmarch'' is a name in the [[Rohanese|language of Rohan]].<ref name=Nomenclature/> The first element ''fen'' means \"marsh\",<ref name=Nomenclature/> probably a reference to the marshlands along the [[Mering Stream]]. The second element ''march'' is an old word for \"borderland\",<ref name=Nomenclature/> probably a reference to the border with [[Anórien]]. It has the same meaning as the element ''mark'' in [[Riddermark]], a \"borderland\", especially one that serves as a defence of the inner lands of a realm.<ref>{{UT|Eorl}}, p. 306</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nJ.R.R. Tolkien wrote in his [[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings|Nomenclature of ''The Lord of the Rings'']], which he had nearly completed by 2 January 1967 after the publication of the second edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' in October 1965, that the ''Fenmarch'' should have been called the '''Fenmark''', but that he had retained the name ''Fenmarch'', because the name ''Fenmarch'' had been used in the text of ''The Lord of the Rings'' and in the [[Map of Rohan, Gondor, and Mordor]]. He wrote that the name ''Fenmark'' should not be translated in translations of ''The Lord of the Rings'' into other languages.<ref name=Nomenclature/>\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien already used the name ''Fenmarch'' in his manuscripts of what would later become the chapter ''The Muster of Rohan''<ref>{{WR|3|VII}}, text D, p. 349 and Note 9 to text E, p. 356</ref> and on his draft map of Rohan, Gondor and Mordor.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[J.R.R.
