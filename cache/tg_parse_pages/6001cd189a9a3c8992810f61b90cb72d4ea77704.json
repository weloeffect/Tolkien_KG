Tolkien]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Life and works==\nChambers was born on 12 November 1874, at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staxton Staxton] in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire Yorkshire].<ref name=\":0\">Charles Jasper Sisson, \"Raymond Wilson Chambers: 1874-1942\".

Chambers and ''The Hobbit''\", in {{TS|3}}</ref> and a profoundly religious man.<ref name=\":0\" /> Since [[1890]] he studied in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London University College London], receiving his Bachelor's degree in [[1894]] and his Master's degree in [[1902]]. He also was appointed  Quain Student (in [[1899]]), Librarian (from [[1901]] to [[1922]])  and Assistant Professor (in [[1904]]) there.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 1922<ref name=\":0\" /> or [[1923]]<ref name=\":1\" /> he became [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quain_Professor Quain Professor] of English language and literature.\n\nChambers's first published work, ''Widsith: A Study in Old English Heroic Legend'', appeared in [[1912]] and was dedicated to old Germanic heroic poetry, especially to the Old English poem [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widsith ''Widsith'']. In [[1914]] Chambers published his revision of A.J. Wyatt's edition of [[Beowulf (poem)|''Beowulf'']].  Chambers continued to study this poem, and in [[1921]] he published his second book, ''[[Beowulf: An Introduction to the Study of the Poem]]. A'' revised and extended second edition of this book came out in [[1932]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nChambers retired from  the Quain Chair in [[1941]] due to failing health. He died on 23 April 1942 at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swansea Swansea] in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales Wales].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Chambers and Tolkien==\nTolkien likely read ''Widsith: A Study in Old English Heroic Legend'' as undergraduate.<ref name=\":1\" /> By [[28 July]] [[1922]], Tolkien had agreed to review Chambers's ''[[Beowulf: An Introduction to the Study of the Poem]]'' for G.N. Clark, editor of the ''English Historical Review''.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Christina Scull]], [[Wayne G.

Tolkien praised Chambers's scholarship and considered him “the greatest of living Anglo-Saxon scholars”, while Chambers also wrote in praise of Tolkien scholarship, calling Tolkien's lecture [[Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics|''Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics'']] \"the ﬁnest appreciation\" of the Old English poem. Chambers sent his publications to Tolkien, while Tolkien likely sent his publications to Chambers in return. Tolkien also sent Chambers some of his creative works, such as his poem ''[[Doworst]]'' and his drafts of the poem ''[[The Fall of Arthur]].''<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nOn [[24 May]] [[1932]] Chambers sent to Tolkien an inscribed copy of the second edition of ''Beowulf: An Introduction to the Study of the Poem.'' Considering that during that time Tolkien was regularly lecturing on ''Beowulf'' at Oxford and working on a [[Beowulf and the Critics|series of lectures]] on that topic, he would have read the new edition of Chambers's book as soon as possible.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAt that time Tolkien was also in the middle of writing [[The Hobbit|''The Hobbit'']]. It is likely that Chambers's book provided some inspiration for the story, especially for the character of [[Beorn]]. The book included a summary of Russian fairy-tale ''Ivashko Medvedko'', that could inspire the initial name of the character, Medwed. The Anglo-Saxon word ''beorn'' and its possible original meaning \"bear\" were mentioned in this book as well.<ref name=\":1\" /> In mid-August of 1937 Tolkien directed his publisher to send a copy of yet-unpublished The Hobbit to Chambers, and Chambers wrote very enthusiastically about this book. Tolkien also sent to Chambers one of his author's copies of The Hobbit after the book was published.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nLater Tolkien wrote the short story named [[Sellic Spell|''Sellic Spell'']], in which the plot of the ''Beowulf'' is re-told as a fairy-tale. This story might also be inspired by the work of Chambers, who studied parallels between the ''Beowulf'' and various fairy-tales.<ref>Paul Acker, \"Tolkien's ''[[Sellic Spell]]'': A Beowulfian Fairy Tale\", [[Tolkien Studies: Volume 13|''Tolkien Studies'': Volume 13]], 2016, pp. 31-44</ref>\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n*[[1912]]: ''Widsith: A Study in Old English Heroic Legend''\n*[[1921]]: ''[[Beowulf: An Introduction to the Study of the Poem]]''\n==External links==\n*{{WP|Raymond Wilson Chambers}}\n==Further reading==\n*[[Douglas A.
