During the [[Elder Days]] he became a servant of Melko.\n\nWhen the [[Gods]] went to the [[Great Lands]] to attack Melko, he ran north and locked himself in [[Utumna]]. Then the Valar opened the gates and asked him to come forth. However, Melko sent Langon to negotiate with their enemies. His message was full of insolence and false flattery, causing wrath among the Gods.<ref name=\"Langon\">{{LT1|IV}}, p. 102</ref> \n\n== Etymology ==\nAlthough ''Langon'' is never glossed, in the ''[[Gnomish Lexicon]]'' there are two entries that could be related: ''lang'' (\"to blare, clang, ring\"), ''langon'' (\"great bell\").<ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 52</ref> So perhaps the name has something to do with Langon \"blaring forth\" Melko's message.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Gnomish names]]\n[[Category:Servants of Melkor]]"}}}
