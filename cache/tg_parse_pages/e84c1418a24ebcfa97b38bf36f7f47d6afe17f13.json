Fengel sent her away into the dark night and the next day she was found frozen to death at the foot of a tall boulder, in which she had carved a curse against him. King Fengel was furious and ordered Wyrgende's body burned and the stone destroyed, but no man of his company could more her, and every hammer and mattock they set to the stone shattered on contact. Fengel himself assailed the stone with his sword until the blade shattered, and a shard pierced his thigh. The wound festered, and King Fengel died of poisoned blood on the first day of Spring.\n\n{{references|Notes}}\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n| race=rohirrim\n| house=House of Eorl\n| born={{TA|2870}}\n| died={{TA|2953}}\n}}\n{{seq\n| prev=[[Folcwine]]\n| list=15th [[Kings of Rohan|King of Rohan]]\n| dates={{TA|2903}} - {{TA|2953|n}}\n| next=[[Thengel]]\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n{{rohankings}}\n[[Category:Kings of Rohan]]\n[[Category:Old English names]]\n[[Category:Rohirrim]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n\n[[de:Fengel]]\n[[fi:Fengel]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/hommes/3a/hommes du nord/rohirrim/fengel]]"}}}
