It was originally a clearly and carefully made manuscript with revisions in typescript for the first few chapters. When he turned to Silmarillion material again in the early 1950s, the manuscript and typescript became \"covered with corrections and expansions\" much of the result being the material used in the published ''[[Silmarillion]]''.<ref>{{LR|P2VI}}, pp. 199-200</ref><ref>{{MR|P3I}}, p. 141</ref>\n\nThis is part of the material that that was sent to [[Allen and Unwin]] in 1937 as potential other material to publish after the success of ''[[The Hobbit]]''. Edward Crankshaw read some pages and liked certain parts but criticized its \"eye-splitting [[Celtic]] names\".<ref>{{L|19}}</ref> In confusion about what the material was and how it was all related Tolkien came to believe that the material had been read fully and rejected, and began on the sequel to ''The Hobbit'' that became ''The Lord of the Rings'' instead.<ref>{{LB|Note}}, pp. 364-7</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n{{title}}\n[[fi:Quenta Silmarillion (The Lost Road)]]"}}}
