Tolkien]], to be sung to the tune of ''Daddy Neptune''. It is published as the 12th song in ''[[Songs for the Philologists]]'' in [[1936]].\n\nThe song is reprinted with Modern English translation \"Elf-fair Lady\" in ''[[The Road to Middle-earth]]'' by [[T.A. Shippey]]. Corrections made by Tolkien himself (after the printing of the ''Songs'') are noted below.\n\nIt mentions several things that ''might'' be precursory to the [[legendarium]]: ''elf'', ''dwarf'', ''exile'', ''a great gem in the sky''.\n\n==The song==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\n'''Ides Ælfscýne'''\n\nÞa ǽr ic wæs cniht, þa cóm ic on pliht:\nSum mægden mé métte ond mǽlde: <ref group=note>[JRRT corr. from:] Þa mette me mægden ond mælde:</ref>\n'Lá, léofa, wes hál!

Alas! elf-fair lady, and my friend, alas! must never more be separated on earth.\n\nShe kissed me straight away, where the moon was shining, she embraced me and bound me in her grasp. Quickly she took me with her under the gloom, where the shadow-way always flickered\n— where the death-mist always flickered. Alas! elf-fair lady, and my friend, alasl where the shadow-way always flickered.\n\nI don't know where I was, we stepped in a boat, where the sea moaned on the sand. I travelled over the ocean, and hid my thoughts to myself, but always my longing grew stronger\n— always longing grew stronger. Alas! elf-fair lady, and my friend, alas! where longing always grew stronger.\n\nThere the ground was green, and her hound was white, and the wheat on the stalk was golden — in the far-off land, on the silver strand, where the dwarf lurked under the mountains\n— the dwarf lurked under the mountains. Alasl elf-fair lady, and my friend, alas! where the dwarf lurked under the mountains.\n\nI prayed to God, tired of my exile by the dim and dreary waves, where the sun did not shine, but a great gem-stone glowed there in the sky with his beams\n— glowed brightly with his beams. Alas! elf-fair lady, and my friend, alas! glowed there in the sky with his beams.\n\nFifty years later I returned again, poor and hurt, to men and my family. The one who had known me before was now in the mould, and now I dwindle, grey and alone\n— dwindle alone and in pain. Alas l elf-fair lady, and my friend, alas! and now I dwindle, grey and alone. \n</poem>\n\n{{notes}}\n[[Category:Poems and songs in Songs for the Philologists]]"}}}
