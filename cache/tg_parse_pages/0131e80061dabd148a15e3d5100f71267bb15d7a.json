As such, years given for certain events in the Fourth Age differ according to the calendar used. \n\nThe [[Shire-reckoning]] is the calendar system used for all dates in the [[Red Book]], with {{SR|1}} corresponding to {{TA|1601}}.<ref name=Hobbits>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref> Years in Shire-reckoning did not restart at the end of the Third Age; they continued uninterrupted from {{SR|1421}} to {{SR|1422}}, and \"in so far as the Hobbits took any account of the change of Age, they maintained that it began with [[2 Yule]] 1422.\"<ref name=Calendars/> This means that {{SR|1422}} is also {{TA|3022}} and {{FoA|1}} as far as dates in the Red Book are concerned.\n\nHowever, in [[Gondor]] and the rest of the [[Reunited Kingdom]] outside the Shire, the [[New Reckoning]] calendar entered use starting in {{TA|3019}}. Under this calendar, [[25 March]] {{TA|3021}} is the first day of {{FoA|1}}, some 9 months earlier than the new year in the Shire.<ref name=Calendars/> The [[Shire Calendar]] and the [[New Reckoning]] begin their years on different days: 2 Yule for the Shire and 25 March for the rest of the Reunited Kingdom.<ref group=\"note\">As these days are named in the Shire Calendar; their New Reckoning equivalents are 7 [[Narvinyë]] and [[Yestarë]] respectively.</ref> \n\nThere are few dates given in the [[legendarium]] that require the reader to account for this difference, because most dates of the Fourth Age are already explicitly expressed in terms of the Shire Reckoning. For example, [[Legolas]] and [[Gimli]]'s departure from Middle-earth is given as {{SR|1541}}.<ref name=\"Later\"/> The exceptions are both from the [[Note on the Shire Records]] and are as follows:\n\n* Tolkien explains that the text of ''The Lord of the Rings'' descends from a copy of the Red Book made in Gondor that bore the note \"Findegil, King’s Writer, finished this work in IV 172.\"<ref name=Records>{{FR|Records}}</ref> The accompanying text notes the equivalent year {{SR|1592}}, which is {{FoA|171}} in the Shire Reckoning, so this note must have been written with regard to the New Reckoning calendar before 7 Narvinyë.\n* In the same paragraph, Tolkien refers to [[Peregrin Took]]'s retirement to Gondor in \"IV 64.\"<ref name=Records>{{FR|Records}}</ref> We are told elsewhere that Peregrin and his companion [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] arrived in Gondor sometime between the autumn and the ending of {{SR|1484}}, which is {{FoA|63}} in the Shire Reckoning.<ref name=\"Later\">{{App|Later}}</ref> As such, the stated \"IV 64\" must be in reference to the New Reckoning calendar, again, prior to 7 Narvinyë.\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nThe Prologue of the first edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' mistakenly mentions that the [[Third Age]] \"ended with the great years {{SR|1418|n}} and {{SR|1419|n}} of the Shire.\"<ref>{{HM|FR}}, p. \"Foreword\", p. 8</ref> whereas the Age ended in {{SR|1421|n}} and {{SR|1422|n}}.
