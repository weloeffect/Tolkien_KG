The stations were on the summits of outlying hills north of and south of the [[White Mountains]] (''[[Ered Nimrais]]''). The stations kept signal fires in readiness and stabled fresh horses for couriers on their way to the allied kingdom of [[Rohan]] north of or the Gondorian fief of [[Belfalas]] in the south of the White Mountains.<ref name=MT/>\n\nThe beacons north of the White Mountains from the direction of Minas Tirith to the direction of Rohan were on the hills ''[[Amon Dîn]]'', ''[[Eilenach]]'', ''[[Nardol]]'', ''[[Erelas]]'', ''[[Min-Rimmon]]'', ''[[Calenhad]]'' and ''Halifirien'' (or ''[[Amon Anwar]]'')<ref name=MT/> with a distance of 20 to 30 miles between each beacon.<ref name=Map>{{RK|Map}}</ref>\n\nThe locations of the southern beacons are not recorded, but based on the description of them being on the summits of outlying hills along both borders of the White Mountains,<ref name=MT/> the distance of 20 to 30 miles between each of the beacons north of the White Mountains<ref name=Map/> and them having posts with fresh horses for mounted messengers to ride to Belfalas, there may have been as many as ten beacons starting from Minas Tirith west along the southern foothills of the White Mountains and then from the southwestern spur of the White Mountains between the river [[Gilrain]] and the river [[Ringló]] southwest along the mountains in [[Dor-en-Ernil]].\n\n==History==\n[[Isildur]] buried his father [[Elendil]] in a casket in a low mound of grass with a black stone lying before it, which was engraved with the letters ''lambe'', ''ando'', ''lambe'' (which stood for Elendil) on the summit of a hill,<ref name=Eorl>{{UT|Eorl}}</ref> which was called ''Eilenaer'' and was then near the centre of the Kingdom of Gondor.<ref name=Tradition>{{UT|Tradition}}</ref> After that the hill was called ''Amon Anwar'', which means \"Hill of Awe\" in [[Sindarin]].<ref name=Tradition/>\n\n[[File:Mark Fisher - Anorien.png|thumb|300px|left|Anórien and the White Mountains with the beacon hills]]\nIt is not recorded, when the beacons on the northern and the southern side of the White Mountains were constructed. While the [[Palantíri]] were still used for communication between [[Osgiliath]], [[Minas Ithil]], [[Minas Anor]] and [[Angrenost]] without the necessity of messages or signals, no beacon was built on ''Halifirien''.<ref name=Eorl/> Perhaps the oldest beacon on the northern side of the White Mountains was ''Amon Din'', which served as a fortified outpost that kept watch over any movement by enemies from [[Dagorlad]] into [[North Ithilien]] or any crossings of enemies from the east over the river [[Anduin]] into [[Anórien]] at or near the island [[Cair Andros]] and sent warnings of such movements with its beacon to Minas Tirith.<ref>{{UT|8e}}, note 51</ref> The beacons of ''Eilenach'' and ''Min-Rimmon'' were the next two oldest beacons north of the White Mountains. They were built while there were still many people living in Anórien to communicate with the people of Anórien who were charged with watching any approaching enemies from Calenardhon or crossings of enemies over the river Anduin at Cair Andros. It was not allowed to build a beacon on ''Amon Anwar'' while Elendil was still buried there.<ref name=Eorl/> The other beacons north of the White Mountains, ''Nardol'', ''Erelas'', ''Calenhad'' and ''Halifirien'' were probably built after the settlement of the [[Rohirrim]] in Calenardhon,<ref>{{UT|8e}}, note 35</ref> because before their settlement, the population of Calenardhon had decreased so that they could have sent little troops and Gondor did not send troops to Calenardhon as Gondor was increasingly struggling to defend the line of the Anduin and to guard its southern coast.<ref name=Eorl/>\n\nAfter [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward]] [[Cirion]] of Gondor had granted Calenardhon to [[Eorl the Young|Eorl]], the King of the [[Éothéod]], the ancestors of the Rohirrim, and Eorl had returned to the north to get his people to resettle in Calenardhon, Cirion had the casket of Elendil moved to the [[Hallows]] of Minas Tirith, because the hill was now no longer near the centre of the Kingdom of Gondor, but close to the border of the new Kingdom of Rohan. In the beginning the guarding and maintenance of ''Amon Anwar'' was shared by Gondor and Rohan. Later when Gondor declined and the population of the Rohirrim increased, only men from the [[Eastfold]] of Rohan guarded ''Amon Anwar'' and called it ''Halifirien'' in their language.<ref name=Tradition/>\n\nDuring the [[War of the Ring]] the beacons of the North were lit when news came to Minas Tirith from [[Lebennin]] that a large fleet of the [[Corsairs of Umbar]] was coming near to the [[Ethir Anduin|mouths of Anduin]],<ref>{{RK|MT}}, p. 765</ref> and as the Rohirrim rode to Gondor's aid through Anórien they travelled close to all seven beacons north of the White Mountains on their way east to Minas Tirith.<ref>{{RK|Muster}}, p. 804</ref><ref>{{RK|Ride}}, p. 830</ref><ref>{{RK|Ride}}, pp. 833-5</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n\n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''\n:One of the major changes made to the story by [[Peter Jackson]] is that when [[Gandalf]] and [[Peregrin Took]] ride to [[Minas Tirith]], the beacons are ''not'' lit since the despairing [[Denethor II]] has decided not to send messengers to ask for help. In the film, there is a beacon just above the city, and to summon the Rohirrim Gandalf asks Pippin to evade the guards and light it. Once he has done so, the film depicts the other beacons being lit one by one until the last is sighted by [[Aragorn]] who is in [[Edoras]], and it is this (and not the [[Red Arrow]], which is not mentioned in the film) which finally helps him to persuade [[Théoden]] to muster the Rohirrim to Gondor's aid.\n\n:Another change is that in the film, there are at least thirteen Beacon-hills as opposed to the seven described in the book.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', \"[[The Lighting of the Beacons]]\"</ref> In addition, the beacons were depicted as signal fires only (without stables), atop mountain peaks instead of foothills.\n\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Great West Road.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Min-Rimmon]] and [[Calenhad]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:[[Halifirien]] is visible in the distance from the [[Rohirrim]] town of [https://lotro-wiki.com/wiki/Beaconwatch Beaconwatch] in the [[Eastfold]].
