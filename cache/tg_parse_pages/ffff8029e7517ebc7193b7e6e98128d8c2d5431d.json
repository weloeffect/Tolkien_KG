Utumno was [[Battle of the Powers|destroyed]] by the [[Valar]] and Melkor imprisoned in [[Valinor]] for three ages, but on his return to [[Middle-earth]], he took Angband as the seat of his power and raised the towers of [[Thangorodrim]] above its gates.\n\nAngband was besieged by the [[Noldor]] during the early part of the late [[First Age]], but the [[Siege of Angband|siege]] was broken at the [[Dagor Bragollach]]. It was finally destroyed by the forces of the Valar at the very end of the First Age, in the [[War of Wrath]]. \n\n==History==\nMelkor built Angband during the [[Years of the Trees]], originally as an outlying fortress and armoury to his great northern citadel at [[Utumno]]. It was built near the northwestern shores of the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] in the range of the [[Iron Mountains]] as a first defence against any attack on Melkor's realm from the Valar in Aman. It was commanded by [[Sauron]], his lieutenant.<ref name=\"s3\">{{S|3}}</ref><ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Battle of the Powers]], the Valar [[Captivity of Melkor|captured Melkor]] and took him in chains back to [[Valinor]], although beneath the ruins of [[Utumno]] and Angband lay many hidden chambers and vaults in which some of Melkor's servants escaped the Valar's assault. Sauron was one of these, as well as the [[Balrogs]].<ref name=\"s3\" />\n\nAngband re-entered history when Melkor escaped Valinor with the stolen [[Silmarils]]; he chose the ruined fortress as his new capital, and rebuilt the Hells of Iron as a base for the dark reign he intended for the lands of [[Middle-earth]].<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref>\n\nSoon after the [[Return of the Noldor]] to [[Beleriand]] towards the end of the [[First Age]],<ref>{{App|Elves}}, p. 1128</ref> Melkor took [[Fëanor]]'s son [[Maedhros]] by deceit and trickery, and hung him by the wrist from the towers of Thangorodrim above Angband. He was rescued by [[Fingon]] and [[Thorondor]], but lost his right hand.<ref name=\"Return\">{{S|Return}}</ref>\n\nThe third of the great battles in the [[Wars of Beleriand]], the [[Dagor Aglareb]], had profound consequences for Angband. Melkor sent out hosts of [[Orcs]] in the hope of taking the Noldor by surprise, but the Noldor chased these Orcs back to the very gates of Angband, and slew them to the last creature. From then until the Dagor Bragollach in {{FA|455}}, a period of almost 400 years, Angband was surrounded by the Noldor; this is the time known as the [[Siege of Angband]].<ref name=\"Return\" />\n\n==Appearance and Construction==\n[[File:John Howe - Angband.jpg|right|thumb|Angband by [[John Howe]]]]\nAngband was primarily an underground fortress, at least after its initial destruction by the Valar in the Years of the Trees. Like its prototype, Utumno, it had many hidden underground chambers and vaults far beneath the earth that not even the Valar could discover.<ref name=\"s3\" />Multiple tunnels lead to smithing chambers and slave quarters.  The throne room was in the middle of Angband while there were deeper tunnels that lead to his mines. Its main features above ground were the three peaks of the Thangorodrim, mighty towers of ash and slag raised above Angband's gates.\n\nThe peaks of Thangorodrim were hollow, and from them channels and chimneys ran down to the deepest pits of Angband. So, Melkor could produce poisonous clouds and vapours, as indeed he sent against the Noldor in [[Mithrim]] during the first days after their Return.\n\n==Etymology==\n\n''Angband'' is [[Sindarin]], and means \"Iron Prison\" or \"Hell of Iron\", from ''[[ang]]'' + ''[[band]]''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, pp. 348,  350 (entries for [[Sundocarme|roots]] [[ANGA|ANGĀ-]] and [[BAD|BAD-]])</ref>\n\nIn [[Quenya]], Angband was called '''''Angamando''''',<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, ''band''</ref> and means \"Iron-gaol\"<ref>{{VT|45a}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n\nIn [[Qenya]], its name was ''Angamandu'' \"Hell of Iron\" or in plural ''Angamandi''.<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry \"Angamandi\"</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n\n'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''\n\n:The dragon [[Smaug]] is said to have escaped the destruction of Angband at the end of the First Age.<ref>{{ICE|2012}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Caves]]\n[[Category:Evil realms]]\n[[Category:Fortresses]]\n[[Category:Gnomish locations]]\n[[Category:Noldorin locations]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n\n[[de:Angband]]\n[[fi:Angband]]\n[[fr:encyclo:geographie:villes tours et forteresses:angband]]"}}}
