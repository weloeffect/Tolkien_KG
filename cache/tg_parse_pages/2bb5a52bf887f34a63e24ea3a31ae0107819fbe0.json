When the [[Dwarves]] and [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] were hauled before the Great Goblin he questioned them regarding their intentions, while accusing them of being spies, thieves, murderers, and friends of [[Elves]]. When one of his guards showed the Great Goblin [[Thorin]]'s sword, [[Orcrist]], he howled with rage and rushed at Thorin with open mouth. At that moment all of the lights in the cave were extinguished and a flashing sword stabbed the Great Goblin fatally. The company soon realized that it was [[Gandalf]] who had killed the Great Goblin with his blade [[Glamdring]].<ref name=\"Hill\"/>\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe death of the Great Goblin - along with Gandalf's ploy of introducing Thorin's company only a few at a time - tickled [[Beorn]]'s fancy enough to gain the Company access to his hall and hospitality. Once Beorn confirmed their tale he warmed up to true friendship and provided the party with aid, advice, and mounts to ride to the border of [[Mirkwood]].<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>\n\nA further consequence of the Great Goblin's demise was a rekindling of the Orcs' hatred towards Dwarves, which led to preparations for war to secure domination of the North. The Orcs assembled at Mount [[Gundabad]] and were about to sweep southward when they learned of the death of [[Smaug]]. Altering their plans, the Orcs marched by night through the mountains and appeared unexpectedly at [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], almost immediately after the arrival of [[Dáin Ironfoot]], and participated in the [[Battle of Five Armies]].<ref>{{H|Burst}}</ref>\n\n== Portrayal in adaptations ==\n===Great Goblin in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile: The Hobbit (1977 film) - Great Goblin 2.jpg|The Great Goblin in [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1977 film)]]\nFile:The Hobbit - An Unexpected Journey - Goblin King.jpg|The \"Goblin King\" in ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]''\n</gallery>\n\n'''1977: [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1977 film)]]:'''\n:In the animated version of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'', the Great Goblin was voiced by [[John Stephenson]].\n\n'''1980: [[Der Hobbit (1980 German radio series)|''Der Hobbit'' (1980 German radio series)]]:'''\n:The Great Goblin is portrayed by Heinz Theo Branding.\n\n'''1989: [[Hobit (1989 Slovak radio series)|''Hobit'' (1989 Slovak radio series)]]:'''\n:The actor providing the voice of the Great Goblin is uncredited, though it is likely Karol Čálik.\n\n'''2003: [[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|''The Hobbit'' (2003 video game)]]:'''\n:In the console versions, the Great Goblin is mentioned but never seen, since Bilbo is separated from the Dwarves before they meet the Great Goblin. However, he's seen in the GBA version, his appearance closely matching his description in the novel. In the latter version, he immediately orders the execution of Thorin and the others after Thorin pleads his case, instead of after the revelation that he has [[Orcrist]] in his possession, before being killed by Gandalf.\n\n'''2008: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Multiple other goblins claim the mantle of the Great Goblin during the [[War of the Ring]]. A running joke in the game is that none of the claimants can stand up to the original Great Goblin; all end up swiftly defeated and as the next goblin rises up to claim the title, the cycle continues.\n\n'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''\n:The Great Goblin, also referred to as the '''Goblin King''', recognizes Thorin immediately, and is greatly interested in him because of the bounty put on him by [[Azog]]. He is temporarily incapacitated by Gandalf, when he arrives. He emerges again after a chase, and is killed by Gandalf shortly before their escape from Goblin-town.
