In the land were fair valleys filled with woods and meads, and on a wide plain there was a shadowy hill from which sprang the [[King's Tree]]. Faery had two ranges of mountains, the Outer Mountains and the Inner Mountains. In the Outer Mountains, there was a [[Lake of Tears]]<ref>{{SOWM|Lake}}</ref> filled with fiery creatures. Its surface was harder than stone and slipperier than glass.  In the Inner Mountains, there was the [[Vale of Evermorn]] where danced the Elven maidens.\n\nDue to the Fay-star that Smith had eaten (which was transferred to his brow on his tenth birthday), Smith was able to visit Faery and explore its various regions. In the Vale of Evermorn he was allowed to dance with the maidens upon the lawn and eventually in a high place he met the Queen of Faery.<ref>{{SOWM|Smith}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Faerie]]\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Roverandom]]\n[[Category:Smith of Wootton Major]]"}}}
