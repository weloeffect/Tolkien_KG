There were windows high under the eaves on the eastern side of the hall. The floor of the hall was paved with a mosaic of stones in many colours that contained intertwined branching runes and strange devices. Its walls were richly decorated with woven tapestries depicting figures from the history and legends of the [[Rohirrim]], including [[Eorl]] on his horse riding to the [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant]]. In the middle of the hall was a long hearth with a wood-fire. At the southern end of the hall three steps lep up to a raised dais with a great golden chair on which the King of Rohan sat facing the doors.<ref name=King2/>\n\n==History==\nAfter the [[Éothéod]] had settled in [[Rohan]], the [[Kings of Rohan|Second King of Rohan]], [[Brego]], the son of [[Eorl]], built Meduseld on top of the hill of Edoras.

The portico had pillars made from great trees, which were carved with interlacing figures and were gilded and painted. The doors were made of wood and carved with many beasts and birds with jewelled eyes and golden claws. [[Christopher Tolkien]] thinks that the description of the exterior of the hall may have got lost during the redrafting of the material.<ref>{{TI|King}}, pp. 443-4</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nIn many ways Meduseld is inspired by [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] poetry, particularly ''[[Beowulf (poem)|Beowulf]]'', which contains the mead-hall [[Wikipedia:Heorot|Heorot]] — the \"golden hall\" of King [[Wikipedia:Hrothgar|Hrothgar]].<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 402</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=[[John Garth]]|articleurl=http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2014/05/j-r-r-tolkien-beowulf-one-mans-passion-threshold-between-myth-and-reality|articlename=J R R Tolkien's Beowulf: one man's passion for the threshold between myth and reality|dated=29 May 2014|website=[http://www.newstatesman.com/ newstatesman.com]|accessed=29 May 2014}}</ref> The name ''meduseld'' is used in ''Beowulf'' in line 3065.<ref name=RC/><ref name=Road>[[Tom Shippey]], ''[[The Road to Middle-earth]]'', Chapter 4 A Cartographic Plot, The horses of the Mark, p. 141 (3rd edition)</ref> On first seeing Meduseld, [[Legolas]] says of it \"The light of it shines far across the land\"<ref>{{TT|King}}, p. 507</ref> This is a translation of line 311 of ''Beowulf'', ''líxte se léoma ofer landa fela'',<ref name=Road/><ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 397</ref> meaning \"The light of it shines over many lands.\"\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Meduseld in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings (1978 film) - Theoden of Rohan.jpg|[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers - Meduseld.jpg|''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Meduseld.jpg|''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n\n'''2012: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Meduseld has a series of side rooms accessible from the main hall.
