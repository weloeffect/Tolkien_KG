Both the [[House of Bëor]] and the House of Hadar were represented with three generations. In this scheme Hador consistently had five functions:\n* Last of the \"Fathers of Men\" to lead his people into Beleriand\n* Entered into vassalage under Fingolfin within Hithlum\n* Founder of the House of Hador\n* Grandfather of Húrin and Huor\n* Perished while defending Fingolfin in the Battle of Sudden Flame\n\nOn his first conception, Hador \"the tall\" was the leader of one of two houses of Men which entered Beleriand, arriving shortly after the people of [[Bëor]]. His two sons were ''[[Haleth]]'' and ''[[Gumlin]]'', with Gumlin in turn being the father of Húrin and Huor.<ref name=\"q9\">{{SM|Q9}}</ref> The people of his son Haleth were the last of the Edain to remain free in Beleriand, being neither penned in Hithlum nor subjugated by Morgoth.<ref>{{SM|Q13}}</ref> \n\nIn emendations to the earliest concept, Hador's epithet was changed to \"the Golden-haired\", Haleth became an unrelated leader of an independent third people (which were the second to enter Beleriand), and Hador's other son became ''[[Gundor]]''.<ref>{{SM|CQ9}}</ref>\n\nThroughout multiple later revisions the duration of the Siege of Angband increased, and the coming of Men pushed forward with it.  Hador's functions thus remained the same.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Birth\n!Entering Beleriand\n!Death\n!Source\n|-\n|88\n|120\n|155\n|[[The Earliest Annals of Beleriand]] (1st version)<ref>{{SM|7I}}</ref>\n|-\n|190\n|220\n|?\n|[[The Earliest Annals of Beleriand]] (2nd version)<ref>{{SM|7II}}</ref>\n|-\n|190 > 390\n|220 > 420\n|256 > 456\n|[[The Later Annals of Beleriand]]<ref name=LR>{{LR|P2III}}</ref>\n|-\n|390\n|420\n|455\n|[[The Grey Annals]]<ref name=ga>{{WJ|One}}</ref>\n|}\n\nIn ''The Later Annals of Beleriand'', two introductions were of Hador's folk abandoning their own tongue to take the speech of the Elves, and Hador's daughter ''Glorwendel''.<ref name=LR />\n\nIn ''The Grey Annals'', Hador joined Fingolfin after hearing that there was room and need of folk in Hithlum. His folk are described as having come from a northland people who were hardy to endure cold and long wandering; thus they did not fear to at times to go far into the North and keep watch on any movements of the Enemy. The date of his people entering Dor-lómin is specified as the year 423.<ref name=ga />\n\n=== Later legendarium: seven generations ===\nIn ''[[The Later Quenta Silmarillion]]'' the entry of Men into Beleriand was pulled back by over a century to the year 310, and thus four additional generations were required.\n\nIn the initial new conception Hador kept his chronologically later functions as grandfather of Húrin, and death in the Battle of Sudden Flame. Hador's function as a Father of Men was now given to [[Marach]] and three further generations—[[Malach]], [[Magor]], and [[Hathol]]—were inserted between Marach and Hador. In this conception Hador was in Fingolfin's household between the years 405–415, and was granted the lordship of Dor-lómin in 416.<ref name=west>{{WJ|West}}</ref>\n\nIn a final emendation \"Hador Lorindol first lord of Dorlómin\" was moved up to become the son of Malach, and \"Magor Dagorlind the Sword singer in battle\" was moved down as the son of Hathol. While [[Christopher Tolkien]] did not use this last revision for ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', he notes \"that this was not an ephemeral change is seen from the [[Athrabeth]], where Adanel is the sister of Hador Lorindol, not of Magor\". This was also seen in an emendation where Hador replaced Magor, as joining his father Aradan, in talking many of their people westwards, with Hador leading the greater number of his folk down the Sirion to dwell in the vales on the southern slopes of the [[Ered Wethrin]].<ref name=west /> \n\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | MAR | | |MAR=[[Marach]]<br /><small>''{{FA|282}} - {{FA|376|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | |,|-|^|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree| | | | | ZIM |~|~|y|~|~| MAL | | IML |ZIM=[[Zimrahin]]<br /><small>''unknown''</small>|MAL=[[Malach]]<br /><small>''{{FA|307|n}} - {{FA|398|n}}''</small>|IML=[[Imlach]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA|310|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | | | |,|-|-|-|^|-|-|-|.| | | |!| |}}\n{{familytree| BEL |y| ADA | | | | | | HAD | | AML |BEL=[[Belemir]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA|339|n}}''</small>|ADA=[[Adanel]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA|339|n}}''</small>|HAD='''HADOR'''<br /><small>''b. {{FA|341|n}}''</small>|AML=[[Amlach]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA|337|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | |!| | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | BEN | | | | | | | | HAT | | | | |BEN=[[Beren (son of Belemir)|Beren]]<br /><small>b.
