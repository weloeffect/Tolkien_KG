They were a riverside people that dwelt in the [[Gladden Fields]], and were fishermen.<ref name=\"Hobbits\">{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>\n==Characteristics==\nThey were heavier and broader in build than the other Hobbits, and had large hands and feet. Among the Hobbits, the Stoors most resembled [[Men]] and were most friendly to them. Stoors were the only Hobbits who normally grew facial hair.<ref name=\"Hobbits\"/>\n\nWhile few Hobbits could swim and they were known to be afraid of rivers and boats (let alone of the Sea, a token of fear and death for them which few had ever seen), the Stoors preferred flat lands and riversides.<ref name=\"Hobbits\"/>\n\nStoorish characteristics and appearance (large build, heavy feet and a down on the chin), could still be seen among the Hobbits of the [[Eastfarthing]], [[Buckland]] (such as the [[Brandybuck Family|Brandybuck]]s) and the [[Bree-hobbits]]. The Hobbits of the Eastfarthing wore dwarf-boots in muddy weather.<ref name=\"Hobbits\"/>\n\nThe Stoors also had their [[Stoorish|own dialect]] of [[Hobbitish|Hobbit-speech]], owing to the fact that they spent some time in [[Dunland]] and adopted many strange words and names which they took to [[the Shire]], and retained even until the late Third Age.\n\n==History==\nThe Stoors are believed to have lived longer in the southern vales of Anduin.<ref name=\"Hobbits\"/> During the Hobbit [[Wandering Days]], after the [[Harfoots]] had migrated westward in {{TA|1050}}, and the [[Fallohides]] flew north first and then followed them [[Third Age 1150|about a century later]], the Stoors long remained back in their dwelling in the Vale of Anduin, but in {{TA|1150|}}, they, too, migrated west to [[Eriador]].<ref name=\"ThirdAge\">{{App|TA}}</ref>\n\nThey took the [[Redhorn Pass]] and followed a southern route along the course of the [[Loudwater]], where some Stoors branched off and moved to the [[Angle]] of [[Eriador]] south of [[Rivendell]], and many settled long between [[Tharbad]] and [[Dunland]]; most went to Dunland ([[Swanfleet]] near Tharbad)<ref name=\"Hobbits\"/><ref name=\"ThirdAge\"/> which most resembled their old lands. There they came into contact with the [[Dunlendings]]. This contact altered their speech slightly, mostly by picking up a few Dunlending words.\n\nA hundred years later [[Angmar]] began to threaten Eriador and many Stoors of the Angle fled ({{TA|1356}}<ref name=\"ThirdAge\"/>–{{TA|1409}}<ref name=eriador>{{App|Eriador}}</ref><ref group=note>The ''[[Tale of Years]]'' suggests that the migration started or happened around the death of [[Argeleb I]]; ''The North-kingdom'' suggests that it happened during the early reign of [[Araphor]].</ref>) because of the [[Angmar War|wars]] and the evil climate of Eriador; however a few of them returned to the [[Stoor-country]]<ref name=letter>{{L|214}}</ref> in [[Rhovanion]].<ref name=eriador/> \n\nThe Stoors of Dunland moved back north to join the other Hobbits in colonizing [[the Shire]] about {{TA|1630}}<ref name=\"Hobbits\"/><ref name=\"ThirdAge\"/> and settled mostly in the [[Eastfarthing]] and [[Southfarthing]]. Some of these villages might have survived until the [[War of the Ring]], when they were sought out by the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]].<ref name=\"UT|Hunt\">{{UT|Hunt}}</ref> One result of the Stoorish influx was that places that were settled by Stoors had some slight linguistic oddities, due to their time of separation and contact with the Dunlendings. The three original Hobbit-kinds merged and blended in the centuries since the settlement of the Shire, but regional variations remained with Stoorish characteristics seen in [[Eastfarthing]] and [[Buckland]].<ref name=\"Hobbits\"/>\n===Stoors of Wilderland===\nThe Stoors who returned to Rhovanion in {{TA|1356}} settled the [[Gladden Fields]] by the [[Anduin]], becoming a riverland people of fishers.<ref name=eriador/> They lost contact with all other Hobbits and nothing is known about their culture<ref name=L214/> other than what Gandalf inferred from his interrogation with [[Gollum]].<ref name=shadows/> While their cousins in the Shire developed a more settled and elaborate social life, it is possible that they reverted to a more wild and primitive lifestyle.<ref name=L214>{{L|214}}</ref> They made little boats of [[reeds]] with which they sailed the River, they fished, and they even swam<ref name=shadows/> (something not common among the other hobbits).\n\nBy {{TA|2430}} their community was ruled by a \"matriarch\" of high repute; possibly a dominant grandmother who had outlived her husband, as she belonged to a large and wealthy family. Among those Stoors were [[Déagol]] and [[Sméagol]], who rediscovered the [[One Ring]], lost since the dawn of the [[Third Age]].<ref name=L214/><ref name=shadows>{{FR|I2}}</ref> Sméagol caused mischief becoming invisible, learning secrets and later stealing, and eventually his grandmother expelled him from the family and their [[hobbit-hole]].<ref name=shadows/>\n\nBy the [[War of the Ring]] the settlements of the Stoors had been deserted.<ref name=\"UT|Hunt\"/> What became of those Stoors and whether they rejoined their folk in Eriador, no history tells.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Stoor'' is supposed to be a special [[Hobbitish]] word that did not exist in [[Westron]] during the [[War of the Ring]].<ref name=\"N\">{{HM|N}}, entry '''Stoors''', p. 763</ref>\n\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote in his guide for translators for the translation of ''The Lord of the Rings'' into other languages that the name Stoors for the kind of [[Hobbits]] was based on the early English word ''stor'', ''stoor'' (\"large\", \"strong\"), which is now obsolete. He explained that it was a hobbit-word that was not current in Westron.<ref name=\"N\"/>\n\nAn earlier manuscript version of what would later become Appendix F states that the name Stoor seemed to have originally meant \"big\" and that this word was common in the language of Dale.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, manuscript F 2, §24</ref> This version also mentions that Scandinavian stor- means \"big\".<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, manuscript F 2, §56</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Stoors.jpg|thumb|300px|Stoors of Maur Tulhau in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2010: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:An isolated village of Stoors called \"Maur Tulhau\" still exists in northern [[Enedwaith]], which in-game corresponds to the area just north of [[Dunland]] proper. The Stoors of Maur Tulhau prefer to avoid the Big Folk whenever possible, but are still known to them and over the centuries have adopted some elements of Dunlendish clothing and language (which in-game is based on Welsh). They are discovered by [[Grey Company]] and the player on their journey south; later the player helps an adventurous Hobbit Bingo Boffin to establish the contact between Maur Tulhau and their cousins from the Shire proper.\n\n:Three more Stoor villages neighbor Maur Tulhau in [[Swanfleet]], in the area called \"Stoor-vales\". Its inhabitants are friendly with the Men who live in the region.\n\n{{References|n}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://middle-earth.xenite.org/2013/02/06/where-did-gollums-people-come-from/ Where Did Gollum’s People Come From?] by [[Michael Martinez]]\n\n[[Category:Races of Hobbits]]\n[[Category:Stoors|*]]\n\n[[de:Starren]]\n[[fr:encyclo/peuples/hobbits/forts]]\n[[fi:Väkevät]]"}}}
