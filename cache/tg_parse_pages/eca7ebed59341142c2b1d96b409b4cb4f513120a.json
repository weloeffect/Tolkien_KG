Located north-west of [[Needlehole]], it connects the rest of the Shire to the [[Blue Mountains|Ered Luin]] region.<ref name=U33>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://www.lotro.com/update-notes/lotro-update-33-release-notes-en|articlename=Update 33 Release Notes|dated=20 April 2022|website=LOTRO|accessed=}}</ref>\n\nIt is described as 'a sparsely populated region of moor, thicket, and fen that has long been home to Hobbit recluses and troublemakers'.<ref name=U33/> It encompasses the northern part of the [[Westfarthing]] and the western part of the [[Northfarthing]], and also includes the wilderness between the Bounds and the [[Lhûn|River Lune]] in the west and the [[Hills of Evendim|Twilight Hills]] in the north.\n\nThe inhabitants are called \"Yonder-hobbits\" by the inhabitants of the Shire proper, which folk of the Yondershire in turn call the \"Hithershire\".<ref name=\"Quests\">[[The Lord of the Rings Online]], Quests of Yondershire</ref>\n\nIt was settled by [[Blanco]], who continued to wander while his brother [[Marcho]] became fat and comfortable in Michel Delving. Blanco built his home at [[Long Cleeve]], near the source of [[the Water]]. Since the time of [[Bandobras Took]], Long Cleeve has been the home of the [[North-took Family|North-tooks]] and the seat of their leader, the Reeve of the Yondershire.<ref name=\"Sites\">[[The Lord of the Rings Online]], Sites of Yondershire</ref>\n\nAnother important village is [[Nobottle]], founded in the time of [[Thain]] [[Ferumbras Took I]] and located near Needlehole on the edge of the Hithershire. The other two settlements are the hunting village of [[Gamwich]],<ref name=\"Sites\"/> and [[Tighfield]], known for its rope-making.<ref name=FTtG>[[The Lord of the Rings Online]], ''From Tighfield to Gamwich''</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n==External links==\n* {{LOTROW|The Yondershire|link=yes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Yondershire}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings Online locations]]"}}}
