His comic fantasy book series ''Discworld'' frequently parodies, or takes inspiration from, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].\n\n==Bibliography, selected==\n===Articles and short stories===\n*[[1991]]: ''[[After the King|After the King: Stories In Honor of J.R.R.

J. R. R. Tolkien. I wrote a letter to him once and got a very nice reply. Just think how busy he would have been, and yet he took the time out to write to a fan.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/17/books/review/terry-pratchett-by-the-book.html?_r=0|articlename=Terry Pratchett: By the Book|dated=|website=[http://www.nytimes.com/ The New York Times]|accessed=12 March 2015}}</ref>}}\n\nIn another interview Pratchett was asked: \"Why do you feel uncomfortable with being ahead of Tolkien?\" and he replied:\n{{blockquote|I think Tolkien will be around in a hundred years time but I’m not certain that I will.<ref>{{webcite|author=SFX Magazine|articleurl=http://www.gamesradar.com/interview_terry_pratchett/|articlename=INTERVIEW Terry Pratchett|dated=09 July 2008|website=[http://www.gamesradar.com/ GamesRadar+]|accessed=}}</ref>}}\n\n{{blockquote|[W]hen I was young I wrote a letter to J.R.R. Tolkien, just as he was becoming extravagantly famous. I think the book that impressed me was Smith of Wootton Major. Mine must have been among hundreds or thousands of letters he received every week. I got a reply. It might have been dictated. For all I know, it might have been typed to a format. But it was signed. He must have had a sackful of letters from every commune and university in the world, written by people whose children are now grown-up and trying to make a normal life while being named Galadriel or Moonchild. It wasn’t as if I’d said a lot. There were no numbered questions. I just said that I’d enjoyed the book very much. And he said thank you. For a moment, it achieved the most basic and treasured of human communications: you are real, and therefore so am I.<ref name=Book>Terry Pratchett, ''[[Wikipedia:A Slip of the Keyboard|A Slip of the Keyboard: Collected Non-Fiction]]'', \"Cult Classic\", pp. 73, 86</ref>}}\n\nHe also talked about how influential Tolkien has been in modern fantasy in his essay 'Magic Kingdoms':\n{{blockquote|J.R.R. Tolkien has become a sort of mountain, appearing in all subsequent fantasy in the way that Mt. Fuji appears so often in Japanese prints. Sometimes it’s big and up close. Sometimes it’s a shape on the horizon. Sometimes it’s not there at all, which means that the artist either has made a deliberate decision against the mountain, which is interesting in itself, or is in fact standing on Mt. Fuji.<ref name=Book/>}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{WP|Terry Pratchett}}\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:British people]]\n[[Category:Fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Letter receivers]]\n[[Category:People by name]]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pratchett, Terry}}"}}}
