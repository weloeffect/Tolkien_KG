Their story is recounted in an early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. \n\n==History==\nThis folk was under the leadership of [[Galdor of the Tree]].

When the [[Iron Dragons]] knocked down the gate, [[Rog]], the leader of the Hammer, shouted his war-cry and both houses leapt at the foe, and \"there the blows of their great hammers and the dint of their clubs rang to the [[Encircling Mountains]] and [[Orcs]] fell like leaves\". From the walls, the [[House of the Swallow]] and the [[House of the Heavenly Arch]] rained arrows down on the invaders, but there was still great confusion.<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|176}}\n\nAfter the [[House of the Hammer of Wrath|folk of the Hammer]] were completely destroyed outside the walls, the folk of the Tree retreated to the [[Square of the Folkwell]], and guarded its western entrance by the [[Arch of Inwë]] against a horde of [[goblins]]. [[Tuor]] and his soldiers entered the Square from the north, Tuor carrying a wounded [[Ecthelion]]. Here Galdor was his salvation, as he rushed to kill the pursuers with his club. The guard of the Tree and many other houses were able to form a good battalion, which was led to the [[Square of the Palace]].<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|181–2}}\n\nAfter the death of King [[Turgon]], Galdor and many others escaped, following Tuor through [[Idril's secret way]].
