This CD is a 12-song album that contains music inspired by [[The Hobbit]]. The songs themselves contain no references to any [[Middle-earth]] characters such as [[Frodo]] or [[Gandalf]], nor place-names like [[Mordor]] or [[Gondor]]. Previously (2009),[[Soundestiny]] released 4 of these tracks on an EP [[All that Glitters]]. This 2012 album contains a further 8 songs that complete their homage to [[The Hobbit]]. The 3-year gap between these releases occurred because the band released their 2nd LOTR-inspired album [[Winds of Change]] in 2010.\n \n==Lineup==\n*Darryl Grant Potter: vocals, guitar, keyboards, flute\n*Kim Sewell: drums, percussion, vocals\n*Elissa Maclean: vocals\n \n==Guests==\n*Clyde Schipke: guitar on 1, 4 and 9\n*Jo Davie: vocals on 7\n*Alyssa Marie: vocals on 1\n*Andrew Stark: bagpipes on 5\n*Matt Herne: banjo on 2\n \n==Production==\n*Producers: Kim Sewell and Darryl Grant Potter\n*Engineer: Kim Sewell (track 12 by Greg Tschernez and Kim Sewell)\n*Arranger: Darryl Grant Potter\n*Artwork: Lester Cannon\n \n==Track listing==\n1.
