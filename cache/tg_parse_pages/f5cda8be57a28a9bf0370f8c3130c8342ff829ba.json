It was the only lasting Noldorin realm outside [[Lindon]].<ref name=\"rings\">{{S|Rings}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nEregion was located in [[Eriador]]<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, p. 1039</ref> west of the [[Misty Mountains]] near the [[Doors of Durin|West-gate]] of the underground [[Dwarves|dwarven]] realm of [[Moria]].<ref name=\"SA1082\">{{App|SA}}, p. 1082</ref> The northern border of Eregion was a low [[Hollin ridge|ridge]] fourty-five leagues (135 miles) south of the elven refuge of [[Rivendell]].<ref>{{FR|South}}, p. 282</ref> Its southern border was the river [[Glanduin]].<ref>{{UT|6d}}, discussion of the name ''Glanduin''</ref><ref>{{RK|Partings}}, p. 984</ref> The rivers [[Gwathló]] and [[Bruinen]] formed its western border<ref name=\"SA1082\"/> and the mountain cliff of the West-gate of Moria was its eastern border.<ref>{{FR|Journey}}, \"to mark the end of their domain\", p. 303</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\nAfter the end of the [[First Age]], most of the [[Noldor]] who remained in [[Middle-earth]] dwelt in [[Lindon]] under the rule of [[Gil-galad]], their [[High King of the Noldor|High King]].<ref name=\"rings\" /> After some seven centuries, [[Celebrimbor]], the grandson of [[Fëanor]], chose to depart from Lindon and passed eastward, drawn by the promise of mithril in the mines of the Dwarves. Many Elves followed [[Celebrimbor]] and founded the realm of Eregion.<ref name=\"AppB1\">{{App|B1}}</ref> Its capital, [[Ost-in-Edhil]], was founded in {{SA|750}}.<ref name=\"AppB1\" /> It was at this time that [[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]] travelled from [[Lake Nenuial]] and settled in Eregion for a while.<ref name=\"Galadriel\">{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref>\n\nThe Elves of Eregion lived in harmony and trading freely with the [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] civilization of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]]. A high road ran from Ost-in-Edhil to Khazad-dûm, and an unprecedented friendship between the two races began in that time.<ref name=\"rings\" /> Within Eregion, an important society or guild of craftsmen emerged with Celebrimbor as its leader: these were the ''[[Gwaith-i-Mírdain]]'', \"the People of the Jewel-smiths\", and their work was said to be the greatest since the time of [[Fëanor]].<ref name=\"rings\" />\n\n===Creation of the Rings===\n{{main|Rings of Power}}\nIn {{SA|1200}}, the Elves of Eregion became friends with [[Sauron]], under the guise of [[Annatar]], the \"Lord of Gifts\".<ref name=\"AppB1\" /> After Annatar taught and assisted the [[Gwaith-i-Mirdain]] with creating the [[Rings of Power]], he left Eregion. Celebrimbor's smiths proceeded then to forge [[Three Rings|Three]] more on their own with the knowledge already gained from him. Their forging was completed by around {{SA|1590}}.<ref name=\"AppB1\" /> Annatar didn't learn about them, and they were \"unsullied\", free from Sauron's corrupting influence.\n\nWhen Sauron created the [[One Ring]] in {{SA|1600}}, the Elves who wore the Rings of Power heard his voice and realised they had been deceived.<ref name=\"rings\" /><ref name=\"AppB1\" /> In {{SA|1693}}, Celebrimbor sent his three rings away for safekeeping: he gave [[Nenya]] to [[Galadriel]] in [[Lothlórien]], who advised him to send the other two to [[Lindon]], away from Sauron, so he gave [[Vilya]] to [[Gil-galad]] and [[Narya]] to [[Círdan]].<ref name=\"rings\" /><ref name=\"AppB1\" />\n\n===War and destruction===\n[[File:Mark Poole - Eregion.jpg|thumb|''Eregion'' by [[Mark Poole]]]]\n{{main|War of the Elves and Sauron}}\nThe Elves of Eregion did not stand alone against Sauron. From [[Lindon]], [[Gil-galad]] sent a force commanded by [[Elrond]] to lend them aid. Before Elrond could come to Eregion, the Dark Lord demanded that the Rings of Power be turned over to him, and when he was refused he brought his full force against Eregion.<ref name=\"Galadriel\" /> In {{SA|1697}}, [[Ost-in-Edhil]] fell, with [[Celebrimbor]] himself leading a last desperate defence on the steps of the Jewel-smiths' [[House of the Mírdain|guild house]].<ref name=\"Galadriel\" /> He was taken captive by the [[Orcs]], then shot through with Orc-arrows, and by some accounts, Sauron used Celebrimbor's body as a banner as he turned to face Elrond's army approaching from the north.<ref name=\"Galadriel\" />\n\nSauron gathered up the Rings of Power that remained, and laid waste the land of Eregion, bringing an end to its people. The surviving Elves of Eregion seem to have scattered, as there are various accounts of their fates. Some fled northward to join Elrond's host, and that host was itself forced into retreat; some of these Elves of Eregion settled at [[Rivendell]] when Elrond founded it shortly afterwards.<ref name=\"Galadriel\" /> They were joined there by others of their kind who had escaped into the [[Rhovanion|Wild]], and only later found their way to safety. Many of these people seem to have later abandoned [[Middle-earth]] and sailed into the [[West]].<ref name=\"Galadriel\" />\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Eregion.mp3|Ardamir}}\n{{Pronounce|Hollin.mp3|Ardamir}}\n''Eregion'' is a [[Sindarin]] name.<ref name=\"PE17\">{{PE|17}}, entry S '''Eregion''', p. 42</ref> It means \"Holly-region\"<ref name=\"N\">{{HM|N}}, entry '''Hollin''', p. 772</ref> or \"Land of Holly\".<ref>{{S|Index}}, entry ''Eregion''</ref> It was called \"Hollin-land\" or short \"Hollin\" in [[Westron]]<ref name=\"N\"/> by Men.<ref>{{S|Rings}}, sixth paragraph</ref> ''Hollin'' is an old form, still used locally, of \"[[holly]]\".
