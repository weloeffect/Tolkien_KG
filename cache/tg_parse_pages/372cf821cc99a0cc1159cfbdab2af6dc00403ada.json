While some of them were refugees, many were bad men.<ref name=\":0\" /> Before the end of [[Third Age|T.A.]] [[Third Age 3018|3018]] the Bree-landers expelled the new-comers from Bree. Two treacherous Bree-landers, [[Harry Goatleaf]] and [[Bill Ferny]], joined with the ruffians and went off with them.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite DTP|id=LR 6.07.029}}</ref>\n\n=== Battle ===\nEarly in the [[Third Age|T.A.]] [[Third Age 3019|3019]] after a heavy snowfall these expelled Men attacked Bree at night. [[Barliman Butterbur]] suspected that [[Harry Goatleaf]] and [[Bill Ferny]] might let the ruffians in.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn a resulting set-to Bree-landers suffered some causalities. Three of the [[Men of Bree]] ([[Mat Heathertoes]], [[Rowlie Appledore]] and little [[Tom Pickthorn]] from over the [[Bree-hill|Hill]]), and two of the [[Bree-hobbits]] ([[Willie Banks]] from up-away and a member of [[Underhill Family]] from [[Staddle]]) were killed.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, the the ruffians were defeated.\n\n=== Aftermath ===\nAfter this skirmish some of these ruffians retreated to the woods beyond [[Archet]], where they lived as robbers,<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite DTP|id=LR 6.07.030}}</ref> while other, like Bill Ferny, joined their comrades in the [[The Shire|Shire]].<ref>{{Cite DTP|id=LR 6.08.019}}</ref>\n\nDespite their victory, the Bree-landers continued to be troubled by the ruffians, since it wasn't safe on the [[East Road|road]], nobody could travel far and people locked their homes early. The Bree-landers had to keep watchers all round the fence and many men on the gates at night to protect themselves from further attacks.<ref name=\":2\" />\n[[Category:Conflicts of the War of the Ring]]\n[[Category:Bree-land]]"}}}
