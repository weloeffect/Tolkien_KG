Tolkien]] changed this to \"pickles\" in the third edition (1966).<ref>{{HH|Bladorthin}}, note 11, p. 43</ref>  The most usual explanation for the change is that the American plant-life would not fit in his setting of ancient [[Middle-earth]].  However, as pointed out by [[John D. Rateliff]], it may have been simply that Tolkien felt that it was too early in the year for tomatoes and substituted a preserved food instead.<ref>{{HH|NC1}}, note 18, p. 18</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''''':\n:[[Samwise Gamgee]], [[Peregrin Took]], and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] are all cooking tomatoes, along with sausages and bacon, over their campfire at [[Weathertop]] when [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] wakes up. In a panic, Frodo stamps his foot on the fire to put it out before the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] see it, and Pippin complains that Frodo got ash all over his tomatoes.\n\n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''\n:[[Denethor]] asks [[Peregrin Took|Peregrin]] to sing to him while he feasts. He eats tomatoes as [[Faramir]] charges on [[Osgiliath]].\n\n'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]''''':\n:Tomatoes are among the food stocked in the Bag End pantry.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Potatoes]]\n* [[Pipe-weed]]\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Plants]]"}}}
