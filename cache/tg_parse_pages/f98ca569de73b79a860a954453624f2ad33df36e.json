Under the council of [[Manwë]], the Valar marched in force with the aim to end Melkor's authority over [[Middle-earth]] and liberate the newly-awakened [[Elves]] from his influence. It culminated in the siege of Utumno, where Melkor was captured, chained, and imprisoned for three ages of the world. The Elves would never know details about the battle, which is shortly told in the ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]''.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\n[[File:Jacek Kopalski - Ring of Doom.jpg|left|thumb|''Ring of Doom'' by [[:Category:Images by Jacek Kopalski|Jacek Kopalski]]]]\nLong time after the Valar settled in [[Aman]], they held council among themselves and spoke of the coming [[Children of Ilúvatar]], who first would be the [[Elves]]. [[Yavanna]] noted that the time of their arrival was unknown and they should not leave the lands of their future dwelling unprotected. [[Tulkas]] likewise agreed with the necessity of immediate action.\n\nManwë bid [[Mandos]] to speak, and he replied that the Children shall come in this age, and the [[Firstborn]] will walk under the [[stars]]. [[Varda]] then created other stars to help to light the world for the coming of the Elves. Using silver dews from [[Telperion]], she created many new stars, including [[Wilwarin]], [[Menelmacar]], and others. After Varda's long works, the Elves [[Awakening of the Elves|awoke]] in the starlight by the shores of [[Cuiviénen]], the Water of Awakening.\n[[File:Anke Eißmann - Oromë espies the first Elves.jpg|thumb|''Oromë espies the first Elves'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]\nWhile [[Oromë]] conducted his hunting trips on his great steed [[Nahar]], he heard the newly-born Elves singing. He met them and spent time among them, and yet perceived the influence of Melkor among them, as they were afraid of him. Oromë reported these findings to the [[Elder King]], who once again called a gathering of all the Valar to the [[Ring of Doom]], even the far-off [[Ulmo]]. He then proclaimed the counsel of [[Ilúvatar]] in his heart that they \"should take up again the mastery of Arda at whatever cost, and deliver the Quendi from the shadow of Melkor\".\n\nOromë and Tulkas often stayed with the Quendi around Cuiviénen, but after the War was decided, they left for the preparations; in their place, [[Melian]] and the [[Five Guardians]], a group of powerful [[Maiar]], were sent to guard and protect the primitive Elves meanwhile.<ref>{{NM|P1xiii}}, pp. 95, 99</ref>\n\n===Battle===\nThe [[Valar]] first came to [[Middle-earth]] on {{YT|1090}}. The titanic conflict between the Valar and Melkor now began in earnest, with the hosts of the West confronting the hosts of [[Melkor]] in the North-west of Middle-earth, and all that region was broken by this engagement. But the first victory of the hosts of the West was swift, and the servants of Melkor fled before them to [[Utumno]]. Then the Valar passed over Middle-earth, and over the next two years, they set a guard about [[Cuiviénen]] to protect the Elves from battle. There the young Elves only felt the shaking of the Earth, and saw the north alight by mighty fires. Thus the Valar began the siege of Utumno, long and grievous it was and many battles were fought before its gates of which all is but a rumour to the Elves.\n\nAfter seven [[years of the Trees]], the gates of Utumno were broken and its halls unroofed, and Melkor took refuge in the uttermost pit. The last of his servants were host of [[Balrogs]], who as a tide of flame assailed the standard of [[Manwë]]. The wind of his wrath withered their fire, and he slew them with the lightning of [[Sword of Manwë|his sword]].<ref>{{AA|50}}, p. 75</ref> Melkor stood at last alone, and [[Tulkas]] arrived and wrestled with him and bound him with the chain [[Angainor]] that [[Aulë]] had wrought.<ref>{{AA|47-50}}</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\n[[File:Roger Garland - Melkor chained.jpg|thumb|right|''Melkor chained'' by [[Roger Garland]]]]\nThe [[Valar]] failed to discover some of the deepest chambers under [[Utumno]] and [[Angband]], and Melkor's lieutenant [[Sauron]] was never captured. Some [[Balrogs]] and other evil creatures hid there, and others dispersed to the far edges of the earth.\n\nFrom the ruin great clouds arose and hid the stars. It was during this time that the contour of Middle Earth was changed, with the [[Great Sea]] being widened. The [[Bay of Balar]] was carved out, as well as other minor bays until the [[Great Gulf]] southwards; the northern highlands of [[Hithlum]] and [[Dorthonion]], sources of [[Sirion]], were raised up as new mountain ranges, and the river came into being.\n\nThe Valar dragged Melkor back to Valinor for judgment before [[Manwë]], in the [[Máhanaxar|Ring of Doom]]. Melkor laid upon his face and begged for mercy from Manwë, but his prayers were denied. He was cast into the prison of Mandos for [[Chaining of Melkor|three ages]], after which he would be brought before [[Manwë]] once more. Although the Elves didn't participate in the war, Melkor never forgot that his downfall was for their sake.\n\nThe Valar gathered in council once again, and it was decided, after some debate, to summon the [[Quendi]] to [[Valinor]] to preserve them from evil. However, the Quendi were unwilling to listen to their summons after seeing their wrath and devastation of the war, so [[Oromë]] chose three ambassadors to accompany him back to Valinor and speak on behalf of their people. The three ambassadors were [[Ingwë]], [[Finwë]], and [[Elwë]]. In Valinor, they beheld the glory of the [[Two Trees]]. The three ambassadors returned to their people and counselled them to accept the summons, and the [[Great Journey]] began soon thereafter.<ref name=\"Captivity\">{{S|Captivity}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n===The Book of Lost Tales===\nIn Tolkien's earliest writings the conflict had a different form compared to later versions. In ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' Melko's devastation of the land is what caused the Valar to assault his fortress [[Utumno#Etymology|Utumna]], whereas in ''The Silmarillion'' it was the discovery of the newly-awakened Elves by [[Oromë]] at [[Cuiviénen]] that prompted the Valar to go to war on Melkor.\n\nThe confrontation between the Valar and Melkor in Utumno is expanded in the ''[[Lost Tales]]'', but unlike the aggressive approach in ''The Silmarillion'', the Valar concoct a plan of deceit to capture Melko by satiating his pride. The heralds of Melko and Manwë whom were [[Langon]] and [[Nornorë]] exchange words and the ruse is successful. Melko invites them to his chamber to pay homage before his seat. The Valar enter Utumna with [[Tulkas]] bound by Angaino (Angainor), and Manwë is about to kneel before Melko. However, the sight of this angers Tulkas greatly and he leaps forward, followed shortly by Aulë and Oromë. A great melee erupts in the hall between the Valar and Melko and his servants, and at the end Melko is wrapped by Angaino. Oromë feels that killing him would be the best solution, but he knows that it is impossible.\n\nAn interesting detail is that Manwë defends himself from Melko's mace by blowing gently.<ref>{{LT1|IV}}</ref>\n\n===Depiction within Morgoth's Ring===\nIn a 1955 essay included in ''[[Morgoth's Ring]]'', Tolkien wrote that the Valarian assault on Utumno was an act of desperation, one they feared would fail, and their main intent was to distract Melkor long enough for the Quendi to flee from him and escape his influence. Manwë descended into the depths of the fortress and met with Melkor, and both were surprised; Manwë, to see that his brother had \"dispersed\" so much of his power into the physical world, and Melkor, to see that, in his mind, he was now physically weaker than his brother and could no longer daunt him with a gaze. In this version, Melkor never fights Tulkas or the other Valar directly, and instead surrenders himself to Manwë willingly.\n\nThough he briefly considers truly repenting, his mind turns to evil, and instead he plots to corrupt and ruin Valinor from within, asking that the Valar take him as their prisoner and that he be allowed to serve them in penance. Out of both pity for and fear of his brother, Manwë accepts, but the Valar do not fully trust Melkor; rather, he is taken to Valinor and placed under the watch of Mandos for \"meditation\" and contemplation on his actions. Unable to enact his plans without being noticed, and now separated from his armies and servants, whom he poured a great deal of his personal might into, Melkor regrets his decision and grows deeply hateful, wishing instead that he had assaulted Manwë and the Valar \"in fiery rebellion\" when he had the chance.<ref>{{MR|P5VI}}, pp. 340-341</ref>\n\n=== Depiction within Nature of Middle-earth ===\nIn a 1960 revision, included within ''[[The Nature of Middle-earth]]'', Tolkien continued to develop the concept of the Valar attacking Melkor before the Great March began. As the Valar had allowed Melkor peace in which to establish himself, and thus neglected the matter until war would involve the Children in misery or destruction, Tolkien concluded \"that the ''rescue of the Quendi'' must be secret (as far as possible), and ''before the assault upon Utumno''\"; therefore \"The Great March must occur behind a screen of investment, and before any violent assault had begun!\"<ref>{{NM|P1vi}}, p. 34</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Conflicts in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Conflicts of the First Age]]\n[[Category:Sieges]]\n[[Category:Wars]]\n[[de:Krieg der Mächte]]\n[[fi:Mahtien Mittelö]]\n[[fi:Mahtien Sota]]"}}}
