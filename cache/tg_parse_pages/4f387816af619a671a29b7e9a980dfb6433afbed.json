Since music touches you, I spare a moment to let you know that I spent a day last week with Donald Swann he <s>is</s> was on a hasty visit to England in the middle of his tour of the U.S. and Canada. We are hoping to produce [[The Road Goes Ever On (book)|a book]], the main part of which will be songs from <u>[[The Lord of the Rings]]</u>, with his setting to be published by [[Houghton Mifflin]] of Boston next year. I find his music moving and very close to my own intentions. He is at present very engaged on the difficult task of making a setting for “Errantry”.<br/><br/>With best wishes again,<br/>Yours sincerely<br/>J.R.R. Tolkien}}\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Letters|Marsh]]"}}}
