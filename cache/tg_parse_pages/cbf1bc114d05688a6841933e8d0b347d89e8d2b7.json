Sprague de Camp]].\n\nChapter IX, \"Merlin in Tweeds: J.R.R. Tolkien\" (based on the article \"White Wizard in Tweeds\", ''Fantastic Stories'' November 1976), is a literary analysis of the works of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. The article also includes recollections of and a quote from Tolkien noted by de Camp during his visit in [[1967]] (see pp.&nbsp;243–4).\n\nTolkien's reaction was described thus:\n{{quote|[Tolkien] said he found [the anthology] interesting but did not much like the stories in it [...] We sat in the garage for a couple of hours, smoking pipes, drinking beer, and talking about a variety of things. Practically anything in English literature, from Beowulf down, Tolkien had read and could talk intelligently about. He indicated that he 'rather liked' Howard's Conan stories.|Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers, pp.&nbsp;243–4\n}}\n\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
