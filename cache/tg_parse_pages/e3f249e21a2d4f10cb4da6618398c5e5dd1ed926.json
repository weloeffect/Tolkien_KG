His daughter [[Nimloth of Doriath|Nimloth]] wedded [[Dior]], Thingol's Heir, and so Galathil was a distant ancestor of both [[Elrond]] and [[Aragorn]].<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}, last paragraph before the section Concerning Galadriel and Celeborn, p. 233</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nGalathil and his close kin shared names with the [[White Tree (disambiguation)|White Trees]].<ref name=UT6e>{{UT|6e}}, fourth paragraph, p. 266</ref><ref name=PMV>{{PM|Akallabeth}}</ref>{{rp|147–8}}\n\nThe conception of this name was based on Tolkien's idea that Celeborn's name was first devised to mean \"Silver Tree\", and his close kin all had \"tree-names\". Although he later changed what he wanted Celeborn's name to mean, referring to \"silver\" and \"tall\" from the adjective ''ornâ'' (\"uprising, tall\") instead of \"silver\" and \"tree\" from the noun ''ornê'' (\"tree\"), he did not revise the name meanings of his close kin.<ref name=UT6e/> \n\nBased on Tolkien's original version of the family's names, ''Galathil'' is a name that can be seen in the tree name ''Galathilion'', which was another name for [[Telperion]]. This was also the name of the White Tree of [[Tirion]], '[[Galathilion]] the Less', and its seedlings were ''Celeborn'' in [[Eressëa]] and ''Nimloth'' in [[Númenor]].<ref name=PMV/> In ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Galathilion was the tree of Tol Eressëa, and [[Nimloth (tree)|Nimloth]] was its seedling.<ref name=PMV/>{{rp|163–4}}<ref>{{RK|Steward}}</ref> \n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | ELM | | |ELM=[[Elmo]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | |!| | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | GLD | | |GLD=[[Galadhon]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |,|-|^|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree | GAL |~| CEL | | GLT |GAL=[[Galadriel]]|CEL=[[Celeborn]]|GLT='''GALATHIL'''}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | |!| |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | NIM |NIM=[[Nimloth (elf of Doriath)|Nimloth]]}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n{{references}}\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Moriquendi]]\n[[Category:Sindar]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n[[de:Galathil]]\n[[fi:Galathil]]"}}}
