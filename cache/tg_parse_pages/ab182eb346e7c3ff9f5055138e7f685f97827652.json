The lyrics of the song are not entirely identical with the original English lyrics (especially when it comes to references to First Age events and locations), but follows the structure and ideas of the original lyrics closely. Gimli presents the poem in a half-reciting, half-singing manner. Its slow and melancholy tune is accompanied by flute (the main melody), a subtle sound of a hammer clanging against an anvil in the distance (indicating the rhythm) and occasional string instrument additions (for emphasizing mood).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Poems in The Lord of the Rings|Poems in ''The Lord of the Rings'']]\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6UabeJ9ksM Rendition by J.R.R.
