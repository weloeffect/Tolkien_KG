He bids them blessings for their journey and [[Gandalf]] then tells [[Frodo]] they are ready to leave. The hobbit looks around somewhat nervously as he asks \"[[Mordor]] Gandalf, is it left or right?\" In response, the wizard tells him \"Left\". \n\n[[Aragorn]] shares a last long look with [[Arwen]] before he gives her a slight nod and smile and follows the rest of the [[Fellowship]] over the bridge out of Rivendell.\n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring scenes|30]]"}}}
