[[Gimli]], [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Samwise]], looked into the dark waters of [[Mirrormere]], then proceeded to [[Lothlórien]], land of the Silvan [[Elves]]. Samwise and Frodo, who had been wounded from the battle in [[Moria]], were carried on the backs of [[Boromir]] and [[Aragorn]]. The company rested for a while and when Sam's wound was examined Aragorn realized that it would heal fast. But when he examined Frodo, he found [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo's]] hidden [[Mithril-coat]].\n\nIn the forest of Lothlórien, the travelers decided to rest. The Elves of the forest welcomed them, although for safety's sake, the Elves decided they would blindfold [[Gimli]], since the Elves of Lothlórien do not trust [[Dwarves]] or permit them in their lands. The company climbed up into trees and spent the night there with [[Haldir]], [[Orophin]], and their brother [[Rúmil (elf of Lórien)|Rúmil]]. Late at night, a company of [[Orcs]] passed by, as well as [[Gollum]], who was searching for the [[One Ring|Ring]].\n\nThe next day Aragorn decided that since Gimli must be blindfolded, they should all proceed with blindfolds, against [[Legolas]]'s wishes. Later in the day, a message came from the [[Lord and Lady of Galadhrim|Lord and Lady of the Galadhrim]], welcoming them all, and ensuring that the Company needed no blindfolds. The forest was exquisite and the company admired it. The company saw the heart of [[Elvendom]] and felt the wonderful power of the [[Galadriel|Lady]] of the [[Galadhrim]].\n\n==Composition==\nThe chapters taking place in Lórien were first written probably towards the end of [[1941]]. During this stage, and while writing this/these chapter(s), Tolkien decided to change Aragorn/[[Trotter]]'s name, replacing it with ''[[Elfstone]]'', and temporarily ''[[Ingold]]'' before choosing ''Elfstone'' again.<ref>{{CG|CG}}, p. xxiii-xiv</ref>\n{{references}}\n{{title}}\n[[Category:The Fellowship of the Ring chapters]]\n[[fi:Lothlórien (TSH)]]"}}}
