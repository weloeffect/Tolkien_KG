Tolkien: A Biography]]'' referring to \"some revision notes\" that Tolkien had wished to use to help him in writing the third edition of ''The Hobbit'' (1966) but had been unable to find. It was first brought to light when [[Christopher Tolkien]] read a portion of it at the 1987 Marquette Tolkien Conference ([[Mythcon 18]]), and at last became available to the public when it was published in [[John D. Rateliff]]'s ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]''.<ref name=\"History\" />\n\nThe 1960 rewrite was a typescript consisting of several updated passages intended to replace corresponding portions of the already-published second edition. Tolkien did not complete the project, however, abandoning the rewrite just before Thorin and Company reach Rivendell.<ref name=\"History\" />\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:The History of The Hobbit chapters]]"}}}
