They were graceful yet strong, and were resistant to extremes of nature, illness and disease. However, many [[Noldor]] died at the crossings of [[Helcaraxë]].\n\nPractical considerations, including a number of occasions where Men were mistaken for Elves (most notably [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]]), suggest that the points of difference between Elves and Men must have been subtle.\n\n==Hair colour==\nAlmost all of the [[Vanyar]] had yellow or deep golden hair. The name ''Vanyar'' means \"the Fair\" in [[Quenya]] with the primary sense of \"pale\" or \"light-coloured\" and the secondary sense of beautiful. The name was probably given to them by the Noldor and referred to the hair colour of the Vanyar, because the Noldor regarded it as beautiful.<ref name=\"Vanyar\">{{WJ|C}}, Vanyar</ref>{{rp|382}}\n\nThe [[Noldor]] mostly had dark hair<ref name=\"Vanyar\" />{{rp|382}}<ref name=\"Translation\">{{App|Translation}}, footnote, p. 1137</ref> with the predominant colours being very dark brown or black<ref name=\"Noldo\">{{PE|17}}, entry Q ''noldo'', p. 125</ref>. [[Maedhros]] and his brothers, the twins [[Amrod]] and [[Amras]] had rare red-brown hair<ref name=\"Sons\">{{PM|XI7}}</ref>{{rp|353}}<ref>{{PM|Ros}}</ref>, that was brown with glints of coppery-red in it, a hair colour that they shared with their maternal grandfather [[Mahtan]]<ref>{{PM|XINotes}}, note 61, p. 366</ref> who had the ''epessë'' ''rusco'', which meant \"fox\"<ref name=\"Sons\" />{{rp|353}}.\n\nIn general the [[Sindar]] had dark hair. Occasionally they had silver hair, especially the kin of Elwe, but it was not a common hair colour among the Sindar.<ref>{{WJ|C}}, Sindar, p. 384</ref>\n\n[[Finarfin]], the youngest son of the first [[King of the Noldor]] [[Finwë]] with his second wife [[Indis]] of the [[Vanyar]], and generally his descendants had golden hair.<ref>{{NM|Hair}}, p. 186</ref><ref>{{PE|17}}, entry root '''GWAN''', p. 154</ref><ref name=\"Translation\" /> Finarfin's daughter [[Galadriel]] displayed an extremely rare hair colour nowhere else observed; golden-silver hair, said to be remarkably beautiful (\"the light of the [[Two Trees]], [[Laurelin]] and [[Telperion]], had been snared in her tresses\").<ref name=\"Galadriel\">{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref>\n\nAnother Noldo with noteworthy hair colour was [[Glorfindel]], whose hair is described as \"shining gold\" in colour.<ref name=\"Meetings\" /> [[Idril]], the daughter of [[Turgon]], King of [[Gondolin]], had golden hair inherited from her mother, [[Elenwë]] of the Vanyar. [[Thranduil]], father of [[Legolas]] and a Sindarin Elf, is described as having \"golden\" hair in ''[[The Hobbit]]'',<ref>{{H|8}}</ref> but Legolas' own hair colour is not recorded. The golden hair colour is sometimes implied among the other Elves: [[Amroth]], a Sindarin Elf of Lothórien is one such case, whose hair is described as \"bright\" and shining like a spark of gold in the sun.<ref name=\"Galadriel\" /> In ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', a very similar reference is made for an [[Galadhrim|Elf of Lothórien]], who had hair that \"glinted like gold\" in the sun.<ref>{{FR|Lorien}}</ref>\n\n==Eye colour==\nWhen Tolkien describes Elven eyes, they tend to be grey. This is certainly true of Lúthien and her descendants, including [[Elrond]] and his children ([[Arwen]], [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]]).<ref name=\"Meetings\">{{FR|Meetings}}</ref><ref name=\"Beren\">{{S|Beren}}</ref> [[Voronwë]], who guided the man [[Tuor]] to Gondolin, also had grey eyes.\n\nThough he was half-Noldorin, [[Maeglin]] is said to have dark eyes (possibly from his father [[Eöl]], who was not of the Noldor), while [[Olwë]] (the brother of Lúthien's father [[Thingol]], and a Telerin king) had blue eyes. The eye colour of most other Elves is not mentioned, and so would be difficult to generalize.\n\n==Pointed ears==\nWhether Elvish ears were pointed or not is open for speculation,<ref name=\"Dunkerson\">{{webcite|author=Conrad Dunkerson|articleurl=http://tolkien.slimy.com/essays/Ears.html|articlename=Do the Elves in Tolkien's stories have pointed ears?|dated=|website=[http://tolkien.slimy.com/ The Tolkien Meta-FAQ]|accessed=15 February 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Martinez\">{{webcite|author=[[Michael Martinez]]|articleurl=http://middle-earth.xenite.org/2011/09/21/do-tolkiens-elves-have-pointy-ears/|articlename=Do Tolkien’s Elves Have Pointy Ears?|dated=21 September 2011|website=[http://middle-earth.xenite.org/ Middle.earth.Xenite.org]|accessed=15 February 2012}}</ref> but it should be noted that there are no explicit references to pointed Elvish ears in ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' or ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. \n\nIn the ''[[The Etymologies|Etymologies]]'' (a linguistic manuscript from ca. 1937-8 published posthumously) it is stated that \"the [[Quendi]]an ears were more pointed and leaf-shaped than [[Men|Human]]<!-- Please do not remove \"Human\" or change it to [?Human], the reading was confirmed in VT45. (User:Morgan) -->.\"<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 368 (roots LAS<sup>1</sup> and LAS<sup>2</sup>)</ref><ref>{{VT|45a}}, p. 26</ref> In another linguistic manuscript (from ca. 1959-60), the [[Elvish]] connection between ears and leaves is again noted: \"[[Amon Lhaw]]. ¶SLAS-, ear.

Tolkien|Tolkien]] wrote that these were \"only slightly pointed and 'elvish'\".<ref>{{L|27}}</ref> Some readers take this to mean that Elvish ears were pointed, while others argue that it is an ambiguous statement.<ref name=\"Dunkerson\" /><ref name=\"Martinez\" /><ref>{{webcite|author=Various|articleurl=http://www.facebook.com/groups/TheTolkienSociety.EducationalCharity/permalink/10154773899876068/|articlename=Tolkien Society Facebook group discussion|dated=|website=FB|accessed=5 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Other characteristics==\nThe Elves were like [[Ainur]] in spirit; they loved all beauty of nature, especially water, the [[Sea]] and the [[stars]], since they were the first things they saw; as a consequence [[Ulmo]] and [[Varda]] were the [[Ainur]] closest to them. They were marked by an insatiable curiosity and a desire of learning and creating.\n\nThey detested all evil and were usually more resistant to being corrupted than Men, unless evil tricked them with fair form, like [[Annatar]]. Conversely, their work harmed evil, like [[lembas]] and the [[Elven rope]] that brought pain to [[Gollum]]'s skin. They were, however, susceptible to greed, pride and jealousy, as exemplified by the story of the House of [[Fëanor]], or the jealous and unjustified hatred of [[Saeros]] toward [[Túrin]].<ref name=\"UT2\">{{UT|2}}</ref>\n\nThe Eldar could manipulate '''''[[sanwe-latya]]''''' ([[Quenya]] for \"thought-opening\" or \"telepathy\") which allowed them to communicate with thought ([[Ósanwe]]). \n\nLike Men and Dwarves, Elves did sleep. In ''[[The Two Towers]]'', it says of [[Legolas]], \"[He] already lay motionless, his fair hands folded upon his breast, his eyes unclosed, blending living night and deep dream, as is the way with Elves.\"<ref>{{TT|Riders}}, p. 442</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, citation of [[Letter to Mr Britten (5 November 1956)|J.R.R. Tolkien's letter]] to Mr. Britten on pp. 373-4: \"''It is plainly suggested that Elves '''do 'sleep'<nowiki/>''', but not in our mode, having a different relation to what we call 'dreaming'.''\"</ref>\n\nAlso, unlike Men, Elves were innately ambidextrous.<ref>{{VT|49a}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Elves were generally considered the most powerful of the [[Children of Ilúvatar]], there are accounts that some Men from the Great Houses of the First Age were physically stronger, though less agile. It is told that the [[Helm of Hador|Dragon Helm]] was given to [[Fingon]], but \"in all Hithlum no head and shoulders were found stout enough to bear the dwarf-helm with ease\", so the High King gave it to [[Hador]], a Man.<ref name=\"UT2\" />\n\n{{References|n}}\n\n[[Category:Elves]]"}}}
