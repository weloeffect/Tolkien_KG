Former nominations (successful and unsuccessful) are listed at [[Tolkien Gateway:Featured articles/Archive]]. \n\nIn considering an article, please review the nomination criteria below to judge for yourself whether the article meets the criteria. If you are satisfied, then create a new section at the bottom of the page, titled with the name of the article, with your rationale for nomination. Should the nomination prove successful, the article could soon be featured on the [[Main Page]].\n\n==Nomination criteria==\nAny registered user can nominate an article for '''featured''' status. It should be well-written, complete, illustrated, and referenced and meet these specific criteria:\n\n:::#The text is ''entirely'' written by TG editors with correct English spelling, grammar and punctuation;\n:::#There are no outstanding [[:Category:Maintenance templates|maintenance templates]] on the article;\n:::#The article is well-referenced throughout, leaving the reader under no illusions as to where to source information themselves;\n:::#The article conforms to TG's [[Tolkien Gateway:Manual of Style|Standards]], as well as those laid out in the relevant [[Tolkien Gateway:Projects|Project]];\n:::#The text is sprinkled with ''relevant'' [[Help:Images|images]] (including captions) of appropriate size - if necessary, including a gallery;\n:::#Articles are at least 5,000 bytes long;\n:::#Where applicable, contains complete sections of \"History\", \"Portrayal in adaptations\", \"Other versions of the legendarium\", \"See also\", \"Genealogy\", \"Etymology\", \"Other names\", etc;\n:::#Where applicable, ''full use'' has been made of relevant templates, e.g.: [[:Category:Disambiguation and redirection templates|disambiguation]], [[Template:Seealso|see also]], [[Template:Main|main]], [[Template:Navigation|navigation]], [[Template:Pronounce|pronounce]], [[Template:Familytree|familytree]], [[Template:Seq|sequence]];\n:::#Where applicable, contains interwiki links;\n:::#Preferably no red-links, but no more than half-a-dozen.\n\nAfter nomination, an article should receive five votes with with no objections within a month or so; each user being able to cast one vote. Each entry should begin with '''Agree''', '''Disagree''' or '''Undecided''' and be signed by the user, and, if they choose, an explanation of their vote.\n\n==Current nominations==\n===[[Gandalf]]===\nIt's a pretty impressive article, and well deserved for my favourite character and such an interesting character.--{{User:KingAragorn/sig}} 07:14, 6 June 2008 (EDT)\n\n* '''Agree'''.  If I'm not mistaking, Gandalf has already been FA once. That doesn't mean it can't be again, but it's near the end of the queue. Oh, '''agree''', btw. but the sourcing needs to be a bit better. -- [[User:Ederchil|Ederchil]] 08:01, 6 June 2008 (EDT)\n\n* '''Agree'''.  This article is extensive, appears complete, well-referenced, and lavishly illustrated.  It is a prime example of what an FA should be.--[[User:Theoden1|Theoden1]] 13:31, 7 June 2008 (EDT)\n\n*'''Agree'''.   Yes, quite well done. Excellent, in fact.--Ingwe\n\n* '''Agree'''.  Nice long article, good information, plus good introduction into Tolkien. {{unsigned|ZehnWaters}}\n\n*'''Agree''' A Middle Earth without Gandalf, is not a true Middle Eearth at all.--{{User:Breragor/sig}}\n\n*'''Agree'''. After reading it, I have to admit it is the best article we have.--<tt><sup><font color=\"#7BA05B\">[[User:Odysseas-spartan-53|Odysseas]]-[[User talk:Odysseas-spartan-53|Spartan]]</font></sup>[[Special:Contributions/Odysseas-spartan-53|<font color=\"#4B5320\"><font size=\"5\">53</font></font>]]</tt> 10:50, 23 May 2009 (UTC)\n\n*'''Agree'''.  Olorin, Mithrandir, Gandalf, conjurer, istar, mighty maiar, there is so much to be told of my favourite immortal.   Elvenshieldmaiden\n\n*'''Agree'''. Exellent Article! Besides, Gandalf is the heart of Tolkien's work.  His article deserves to be featured. [[User:Mthomas|mthomas]] 12:30, 7 June 2009 (UTC)\n\n*'''Agree'''. The first thing new users see is the main page, and generally people are most familiar with Gandalf. --Yurpee\n\n*'''Agree'''. A central character in the LoTR trilogy. Everyone knows who he is and he deserves a good moment in the spotlight. -- Naruvir\n\n*'''Disagree''' - I think it's a big cluttered in its structure and severely lacks sources required to make it worthy of the title. --{{User:Mith/sig}} 14:23, 4 January 2011 (UTC)\n\n*'''Agree'''. It definitely deserves to be featured, but I think later, after the revisions are done because of the Hobbit movies coming. {{Unsigned|Lilybell}}\n\n*'''Agree'''. It is a well written article, the main picture is appropriate, and there are very little red links. This article gives a great introduction to Gandalf for someone who is new to Tolkien's works. Plus, the character is just all-around amazing. --[[User:Joszyboom|Joszyboom]]\n\n*'''Agree'''. I think it is an important fact that Gandalf is a Miar, and not just a human with powers. I don't think that many people would know that, but it is important and this will help. -- quark\n\n*'''Agree'''. I remember when I was just getting into Tolkien's works in 6th grade with The Hobbit and had no idea who Gandalf was then I went to LOTR and Gandalf with the \"You Shall Not Pass\" I was amazed and started to delve deeper but that was my own initiative if this article goes on the home page then any new Tolkien reader would go and read it learning a substantial amount of knowledge. -- Aragorn is Awesome\n\n*'''Agree'''. But, people get so excited about editing his article that they forget the citations...--[[User:Erónèhire|Erónèhire]] 02:33, 10 March 2021 (UTC)\n\n*'''Agree'''. It's a pretty big article and includes all information like detailed history as well as many images.--Shivam 07:38, 9 April 2021 (UTC)\n\n*'''Disagree'''. Needs more references and the matter of his names is a mess. When this is solved, I'll give Gandalf priority to be featured. --[[User:LorenzoCB|LorenzoCB]] 11:00, 13 April 2022 (UTC)\n\n*'''Agree'''. As the above concern has now been addressed I vote this article finally be made a featured one. --[[User:JR Snow|JR Snow]] ([[User talk:JR Snow|talk]]) 15:50, 28 June 2025 (UTC)\n\n*'''Agree'''. Agree with the above reasoning. [[User:Paccyd33|Paccyd33]] ([[User talk:Paccyd33|talk]]) 06:03, 7 November 2025 (UTC)\n===[[Dwalin]]===\nAs Smaug has been featured for almost nine months now I think it is time to look for a new featured article. Personally I think [[Dwalin]] might be a good choice. It is well-writen, sourced, no maintaince templates and only one red link. Although Dwalin isn't as long as previous featured articles, it covers (almost) all information that can be found in the books. And, with [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]] coming this year people will search for more information about the Hobbit and characters/locations. Therefore it would be good if an article related to The Hobbit will appear on the main page. --[[User:Amroth|Amroth]] 19:57, 9 March 2012 (UTC)\n\n:+1.--[[User:Morgan|Morgan]] 20:07, 9 March 2012 (UTC)\n\n:Any other opinions? --[[User:Amroth|Amroth]] 14:53, 21 March 2012 (UTC)\n\n::I don't like the main image.--{{User:KingAragorn/sig}} 15:20, 21 March 2012 (UTC)\n\n:::I kind of agree, but we don't have many other images of him. The only other suitable image seems to be [[:File:New Line Cinema - Dwalin 2.png|this one]]. --[[User:Amroth|Amroth]] 19:55, 21 March 2012 (UTC)\n\n::::Why not an image from The Hobbit film?--[[User:Erónèhire|Erónèhire]] 02:31, 10 March 2021 (UTC)\n\n===[[Bard]]===\nAlthough Gondolin has only been featured for just over 3 months, I think that the featured article should be updated more often. I feel that [[Bard]] is a great option, because sometimes i think he's underappreciated. He played a big part in The Battle of the Five Armies, and was the King of [[Dale]] for quite some time. --[[User:BrandonEchols|BrandonEchols]] 00:01, 10 April 2023 (UTC)\n\n*'''Agree'''. It's a good article. However, I disagree with updating things more often. I've taken the resolution to update the whole Main Page exactly twice a year, in due dates.--[[User:LorenzoCB|LorenzoCB]] ([[User talk:LorenzoCB|talk]]) 12:07, 11 April 2023 (UTC)\n\n*'''Agree'''. I think it would be a good choice, because he is '''truly''' underappreciated.--[[User:MEGRIMLOCK|MEGRIMLOCK]] ([[User talk:MEGRIMLOCK|talk]]) 13:01, 2 May 2023 (UTC) \n\n*'''Disagree'''. While the article is interesting and while he is an important character in [[The Hobbit]], the article does not fullfill the criteria for nomination yet. It lacked references for the dates of his rule, the dates of his death and his minimum age at the time of his death. In addition, there were errors in the article. I corrected errors and added references, but the article is not finished yet. --[[User:Akhorahil|Akhorahil]] ([[User talk:Akhorahil|talk]]) 15:36, 2 May 2023 (UTC)\n\n:True, I will help work on his page.--[[User:MEGRIMLOCK|MEGRIMLOCK]] ([[User talk:MEGRIMLOCK|talk]]) 16:40, 2 May 2023 (UTC)\n\n=== [[Eriol]] ===\nNot to toot my own horn, but I've spent days upon days trying to perfect that article since 2022. It's been sourced to death, and I think that a featured article dealing with the material from ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' and the early legendarium in general would be a refreshing change of pace on the main page. It would also expose more people to the absolute wonders of the ''Lost Tales''.\n\nBut, of course, folks here should be the judge of how good that article is. - [[User:IvarTheBoneless|IvarTheBoneless]] ([[User talk:IvarTheBoneless|talk]]) 17:11, 14 October 2023 (UTC)\n\n*'''Agree'''. --[[User:LorenzoCB|LorenzoCB]] ([[User talk:LorenzoCB|talk]]) 11:35, 16 December 2023 (UTC)\n*'''Agree'''. --[[User:Valkeyor]] I think it would be refreshing to put the early legendarium work on the page. 1:20, 10 May 2024 (UTC)\n*'''Agree'''.[[User:Dour1234|Dour1234]] ([[User talk:Dour1234|talk]]) 20:23, 10 May 2024 (UTC)\n*'''Agree'''. Agree with Valkeyor's reasoning, especially since he's the central kinda figure. Anybody who hadn't read it could click on one of the stories which has been told and learn more about it. It works well as a kind of hub for lost tales. [[User:Paccyd33|Paccyd33]] ([[User talk:Paccyd33|talk]]) 06:03, 7 November 2025 (UTC)\n\n=== ''[[The End of Bovadium]]'' ===\nGiven that this story is going to be published next week, I feel like it would be good to have it featured for that week. Also, the page contain a lot of information with references to many sources.[[User:Dour1234|Dour1234]] ([[User talk:Dour1234|talk]]) 10:48, 4 October 2025 (UTC)\n\n* Disagree: I appreciate the timeliness argument you put at the time, and the effort you've clearly put into the article.  I also think that having some non-legendarium presence on the main page would serve to promote the casual visitor's understanding that this is a Tolkien site, not a legendarium site.  To be a featured article, though, I suggest the red links need addressing, and the Background section reworked, possibly to separate into the elements it contains, for example: Creation, Themes and Intent; Publication History and Commentary. Or something. [[User:Bunt|Bunt]] ([[User talk:Bunt|talk]])"}}}
