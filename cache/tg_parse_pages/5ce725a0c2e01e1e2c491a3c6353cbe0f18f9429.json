It was written by many different authors, using [[Cirth]] of Moria and [[Dale]], as well as [[Tengwar]] . The pages of the book were marked with numbers referring to the years after [[Balin]]'s arrival in Moria.\n\n==History==\nThe book started being updated in {{TA|2989}}, upon Balin's return to Moria. The book recounted a battle with the [[Orcs]] that inhabited the old halls of Khazad-dûm, in which [[Balin]]'s Dwarves were victorious. They settled in the Twenty-first Hall, above the East-gate, and Balin himself ruled his new domain from the old Chamber of Records, also called the [[Chamber of Mazarbul]]. Over the next five years, the [[Dwarves]] seem to have settled quite successfully into their new home, exploring under the Mountains as far as the [[Doors of Durin|West-gate of Moria]], and recovering [[Durin's Axe]] and apparently other priceless items made of ''[[mithril]]''. These feats were recorded in the book.\n\nThe Lordship of Balin was short-lived. [[Ori]], who was with him in Moria, recorded in the last pages of the Book how an army of Orcs came unexpectedly out of the east, slaying Balin outside the [[Great Gates|East-gate]]. The Dwarves defended themselves, but they were beleaguered from the east by the Orcs, and from the west by the mysterious [[Watcher in the Water]]. Their last stand was in the Chamber of Mazarbul, where the Orcs eventually overcame and destroyed them. As there was no hope to escape, Ori continued writing in the book, hoping that someone would find it, and would know what happened to them.<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #10</ref>\n\nThe victorious Orcs seem not to have understood the significance of the Book, so that rather than carrying it off or destroying it, they left it to rot in the Chamber. There it was found twenty-four years later by the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Company of the Ring]], burned, slashed and blood-stained, and missing a number of pages, but still readable in some parts. [[Gandalf]] passed it to [[Gimli]] to return to King [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin]], after which nothing more is heard about it. If Gimli was able to keep it through the battles that followed, and didn't discard it with his gear at [[Parth Galen]], it is possible that he carried it throughout his travels in [[Middle-earth]], returning it at last to Dáin's heir [[Thorin Stonehelm|Thorin III]] in [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]].\n\n==Contents==\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Mazarbul page 1.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Facsimile of page I]]\nThe first page [[Gandalf]] read in the Book of Mazarbul was marked ''one-three'', so at least two were missing from the beginning. This page was written using [[Angerthas Erebor]] as in a diary, written quickly without attempt at calligraphy or meticulous consistency of spelling. In writing the Common Speech, the Dwarves tended to blend its usual spelling with certain idiosyncratic phonetic usages (the Dwarves did not like to use any letter or rune in more than one value, nor to express a simple sound by combinations of letters). This page was numbered at the top with the runic numeral \"three\".<ref>''[[Pictures by J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', ''[[The Treason of Isengard]]'' and ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator]]''.</ref>\n\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Mazarbul page 2.jpg|150px|thumb|Facsimile of page II]]\nGandalf skimmed through the rest of the book; Gandalf notes that the pages begin to be numbered ''five'', meaning the fifth year of the colony. This second page was written using [[Tengwar]] of the later Westron convention which used full letters for vowels. Gandalf described the text as written by \"a large bold hand using an Elvish script\", which Gimli describes as [[Ori]]'s hand. The runic figure at the bottom of the page is the numeral \"five\".\n\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Mazarbul page 3.jpg|150px|thumb|Facsimile of page III]]\nThe last page of the Book of Mazarbul was read aloud by Gandalf. It is written in [[Angerthas Erebor]], similar to that of the first page, but with a different hand and different details in the runes. The last line is a trailing scrawl of elf-letters reads ''They are coming...''\n\n==Text==\n===Page One-three===\n''1 - 3<br/>We drove out orcs from the [[Great Gates|great gate]] and guard<br/>(r)oom and took the [[First Hall|first hall]]: we slew many in the br<br/>(i)ght sun in the dale: [[Flói]] was killed by an arr<br/>ow.

So the \"Book of Mazarbul\" means the \"Book of Records\".\n\n==Inspiration==\nTolkien comments on his general treatment of the Book of Mazarbul pages: \"...the text was cast into English spelt as at present, but modified as it might be by writers in haste whose familiarity with the written form was imperfect, and who were also (on the first and third pages) transliterating the English into a different alphabet.\"; \"...since documents of this kind nearly always show uses of letters or shapes that are peculiar and rarely or never found elsewhere, a few such features are also introduced...\".\n\nTolkien used his knowledge of medieval manuscripts to create three facsimile pages from the Book of Mazarbul. He burnt the edges with his pipe, pierced holes along the left-hand side where the pages would have been stitched to the binding, and washed the paper with red and brown paint to resemble dried bloodstains.\n\nThe final page was written mostly in runes apart from the final scrawled line ('they are coming') which was written in the Elvish script, presumably easier to use when writing at speed.\n\nThe use of English to represent the Common Speech in primary sources such as the pages of the Book of Mazarbul was a result of Tolkien's vision of completely translating all Westron into modern English, even in authentic documentation, although upon reflection Tolkien said that this translation was \"an erroneous extension of the general linguistic treatment\".<ref>{{HM|PM}}, [[Of Dwarves and Men]] pp. 298-9)</ref>\n\nThus, the Book of Mazarbul showcases some slightly different distributions of certain English sounds.\n\n==Other versions of the Legendarium==\nTolkien hoped that these facsimile documents would be reproduced in the text but the cost of including colour pages was a step too far for his publisher, who was already taking a significant gamble by publishing this enormous three volume fantasy work for adults.\n\nEventually, they were included in the ''[[Fellowship of the Ring]]: 50th Anniversary Deluxe edition'' in [[2005]], and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]: One-volume Special edition'' in [[2021]]. They are also included in several artwork collections, such as ''[[Pictures by J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', ''[[The Art of The Lord of the Rings]]'', and ''[[Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth]]''.<ref>[https://tai.tolkienists.org/ Tolkien Art Index] on Tolkienists.org</ref>\n\nThe manuscripts are now in the archive in the [[Bodleian Libraries]].<ref>[https://museoteca.com/r/en/work/7386/j_r_r_tolkien/final_page_of_the_book_of_mazarbul/!/ Final page of the Book of Mazarbul] on Museoteca.com</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Book of Mazarbul in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring - Book of Mazarbul.jpg|Book of Mazarbul in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''\n</gallery>\n'''2001: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''\n:The Book of Mazarbul makes an appearance in the fifth episode of the first series, set entirely in Moria. Gandalf (portrayed by Martin Huba) begins reading from it, but the majority of the excerpts are heard as a voiceover by the deceased elderly dwarf Ori (portrayed by František Kovár), the chronicler of Balin's expedition to Moria.\n\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''\n:A detailed prop was made for the movie, with Cirth and Tengwar letters written perhaps by [[Daniel Reeve]]. The outside cover of the prop reads: \"Records (of the) Longbeards of Khazad-dûm\".\n\n:The first page of the book read by Gandalf in the movie is written using Cirth (Angerthas Erebor) and Tengwar (full mode). A number of leaves before this page fall out when Gandalf opens the book. This apparently is the second to the last page.\n:The text read by Gandalf in the movie differs from that of the books, and is largely based on the final two pages:\n:''\"They have taken the Bridge and the Second Hall. We have barred the gates, but cannot hold them for long. The ground shakes... Drums. Drums in the deep. We cannot get out. A Shadow moves in the dark... We cannot get out...
