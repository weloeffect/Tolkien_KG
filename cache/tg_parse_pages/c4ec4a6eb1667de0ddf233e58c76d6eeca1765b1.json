Craftsmen from Nogrod were tasked to accomplish this but they also desired to possess the jewel and necklace for themselves and when their work ended they refused to give it to the king. In the conflict Thingol was killed. The rest of the Dwarves were hunted down and slain as they fled home and Nauglamir was taken from them.\n\nAfter the death of Thingol [[Melian]] returned to [[Valinor]] and her magical control upon the woods of Doriath waned after her. Before leaving, Melian had told Mablung to warn [[Beren]] about the evil deed of the Dwarves.\n\n==History==\n===Prelude===\nTwo Dwarves survived the slaughter, and made it to their home of [[Nogrod]] in the [[Blue Mountains]]. They lied saying that Thingol killed the Dwarves that made the Nauglamir, refusing to pay them for their work. Their kinsmen became enraged and decided to avenge their fallen brethren. They sent word to the [[Dwarves of Belegost]] but they refused to aid them, but nonetheless formed a great host. They entered [[Beleriand]] and crossing [[Aros]], marched west towards [[Doriath]].\n\nAs the Dwarven host marched through the forest none withstood them as the [[Girdle of Melian]] waned after Melian departed. The grey-elves and their captains scattered without hope.\n\n===Battle===\nThe Dwarves found resistance only by the Sindar inside Menegroth. The losses were heavy on both sides during the grievous battle.<ref name=\"Ruin\"/> [[Mablung]] was defending the treasury where the Nauglamir lay, and there he was killed before its doors, and the Silmaril was taken. The Dwarves emerged victorious and the halls of Thingol were plundered.\n\n===Aftermath===\nMany Elves and Dwarves perished in the underground caves of Menegroth, and the mound where they were laid to rest in Doriath came to be known as [[Cûm-nan-Arasaith]], the Mound of Avarice<ref>{{SM|3}}, p. 133, p. 189, p. 325.</ref>. After they plundered its treasures they made their way home to Nogrod. A messenger from Doriath brought tidings of what has befallen there to Beren and Lúthien. With the help of the [[Green-elves]] and [[Ents]] Beren ambushed the Dwarves near [[Sarn Athrad]] and in the [[Battle of Sarn Athrad|battle]] Beren emerged victorious. The treasure of Menegroth fell in [[Ascar]], except for the Nauglamir, which Beren brought to Lúthien.<ref name=\"Ruin\"/>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn the earliest version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', the story has a much different developent. In this version, Menegroth is attacked by an alliance of Dwarves, the [[Dwarves of Nogrod|Nauglath]] (Dwarves of Nogrod) and [[Dwarves of Belegost|Indrafangs]] (Dwarves of Belegost) led by their respective kings [[Naugladur]] of Nogrod and [[Bodruith]] of Belegost. They were also joined by mercenary Orcs. The Dwarven-Orc host were aided by [[Narthseg]], an Elf of [[Artanor]] that guided the host through the [[Girdle of Melian|magic]] of [[Melian|Gwendelin]] as well as provide information of [[Thingol|Tinwelint]]'s location, who is still alive at this point of the narrative.\n\nThe Orcs and the Indrafangs assaulted the unprepared city. There was a bloody battle in the gates until eventually the guards were pushed back and the halls and chambers were ransacked. Tinwelint and Mablung are not inside Menegroth when the attack happens but are outside in the woods, hunting in commemoration of the prior [[Hunting of the Wolf]]. Tinwelint and his company were surrounded by the Nauglath led by Naugladur. Both forces clashed until at the end both Mablung and the king fell side by side. Naugladur cut off the head of the dead king and claimed the Nauglafring.<ref>{{LT2|IV}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Conflicts in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Conflicts of the First Age]]"}}}
