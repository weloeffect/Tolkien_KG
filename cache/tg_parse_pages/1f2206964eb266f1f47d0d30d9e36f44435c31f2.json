It accomplished little, however, as the Noldor lacked the art of ship-building, and they were only able to go so far as the [[Isle of Balar]] where they established lonely dwellings.<ref name=\"tcg\">{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>\n\nAfter Turgon learned of the [[Fall of the Falas|ravaging of the Falas]], and of Círdan's relocation of a remnant of his people to the [[Isle of Balar]], he sent further messengers, including Voronwě.<ref name=\"tcg\" />\n\nVoronwë delayed on the road, tarrying in [[Nan-tathren]] and because of this he was the final one to embark on the last ship that Círdan, at the request of Turgon, had built for them. After sailing for seven years without reaching the lands in the West, his ship attempted to return to Middle-Earth defeated. In a storm within sight of the coast the ship was wrecked and all save him were drowned. By the grace of Ulmo, Voronwë was saved from the wreck and washed ashore in [[Nevrast]], near [[Vinyamar]]. He was sitting at its wall when he encountered [[Tuor]] and heard his story as the messenger of Ulmo and led him back to Gondolin.<ref>{{S|Tuor}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Fall of Gondolin]] he was ordered by Tuor to guard [[Idril]]. He escaped the sack.\n\nIt is said that he may have left Middle-earth with Tuor and Idril.<ref name=\"Tuor\" />\n\n==Etymology==\n''Voronwë'' is [[Quenya]] for \"Steadfast\"<ref>{{S|Index}}, entry \"Voronwë\"</ref> or \"steadfastness\".<ref name=\"Eldarin\">{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 189</ref>\n\nThe [[Sindarin]] cognate for ''Voronwë'' was '''''Bronwë'''''.<ref name=\"Eldarin\" />\n\nHis epithet '''''Aranwion''''' was his patronymic, meaning simply \"Son of [[Aranwë]]\".<ref>{{UT|Index}}, entry \"Aranwë\"</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| | | | | |F|~|~|~|7| |}}\n{{familytree| ARA |y| MOT | | CIR |ARA=[[Aranwë]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA}}''</small>|MOT=''unknown mother''|CIR=[[Círdan]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | |!| | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | VOR | | | | | | |VOR='''VORONWË'''<br /><small>''b. {{FA}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', his [[Qenya]] name ''Voronwë'' meant \"the Faithful\", but he was mostly known in [[Gnomish]] '''''Bronweg''''' (\"the Constant One\").<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry \"Bronweg\"</ref> As in later works, he is the guide of Tuor, but also the father of [[Littleheart]] &ndash; a figure that does not recur elsewhere.<ref name=\"LT2Gondolin\">{{LT2|III}}, passim</ref>\n\nAccording to the earlier and most accounts, he sailed with [[Eärendel]] on his voyages, not Tuor.<ref name=\"SM\">{{SM|Q17}}</ref>\n\n{{references|notes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Voronwe}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Gondolindrim]]\n[[Category:House of Fingolfin]]\n[[Category:Mariners]]\n[[Category:Moriquendi]]\n[[Category:Noldor]]\n[[Category:Qenya names]]\n[[Category:Quenya names]]\n\n[[de:Voronwe]]\n[[fi:Voronwë]]\n[[fr:/encyclo/personnages/elfes/noldor/voronwe]]"}}}
