The whole world was designed with such loveliness, not of one thought, but of many in harmony; though in all its shapes there was nowhere any to recall what we call organic life. There \"inanimate nature\" was orderly, symmetrical, unconfused, yet intricate, beyond my mind's unravelling, in its flowing modulations and recollections: a garden, a paradise of water, metal, stone, like the interwoven variations of vast natural orders of flowers. Eshúrizel! Blue, white, silver, grey, blushing to rich purples were its themes, in which a glint of red was like an apocalyptic vision of essential Redness, and a gleam of gold was like the glory of the [[Sun]]. And there was music, too. For there were many streams, water abundant – or some fairer counterpart, less wayward, more skilled in the enchantment of light and in the making of innumerable sounds. There the great water fall of [[Öshül-küllösh]] fell down its three hundred steps in a sequence of notes and chords of which I can only hear faint echoes now. I think the [[En-keladim]] dwell there.<ref name=Notion/>{{rp|198–9}}}}\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Cosmology]]\n[[Category:The Notion Club Papers]]"}}}
