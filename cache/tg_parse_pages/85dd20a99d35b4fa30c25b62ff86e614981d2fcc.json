Within this settlement was the [[Hall of the Chieftains|Hall]] of the [[Halad|Chieftains]] or Warden of Brethil, who was the leader of the land.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, p. 263</ref> Ephel Brandir lay upon the hill of [[Amon Obel]], and is where [[Túrin]] was taken when he fell ill. It was ruled by [[Brandir]] son of [[Handir]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Ephel Brandir'' is [[Sindarin]] for \"the encircling fence of Brandir\".<ref>{{UT|15}}, p. 435, entry \"Ephel Brandir\"</ref>\n\n''Obel Halad'' meant the Fortified Settlement of the Halad.\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nIn earlier versions, transient names for Ephel Brandir were '''[[Tavrobel#Tavrobel_in_Brethil|Tavrobel]]''' and '''Bar Haleth''', and these can be seen on the [[The Second 'Silmarillion' Map]]. The location for Tavrobel and Bar Haleth were considerably eastward of where Ephel Brandir would be located.<ref name=woj_c_324>{{WJ|P1c}}, §324</ref>\n\nAs noted by [[Christopher Tolkien]]: \"Beyond the fact that ‘Tavrobel’ was in the extreme east of Brethil it is not possible to be sure of its site. Bar Haleth was in turn crossed out. It seems certain therefore that this was a transient name for Ephel Brandir, which was marked in subsequently in the centre of Brethil\"<ref name=woj_c_324 />\n\nIn the development of the story, \"[[The Wanderings of Húrin]]\" (a tale that [[Christopher Tolkien]] regretfully excluded from ''[[The Silmarillion]]''), Obel Halad replaced [[Ephel Brandir]] as the chief settlement of the [[Haladin]].<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, note 17, p. 301</ref> Since Ephel Brandir was built upon [[Amon Obel]]<ref>{{UT|Index}}</ref> it is likely that its replacement was also intended to be in the same location.\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Beleriand]]\n[[Category:Cities, towns and villages]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n\n[[de:Ephel Brandir]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/villes tours et forteresses/beleriand/ephel brandir]]\n[[fi:Ephel Brandir]]"}}}
