Lewis]] during his undergraduate years. Sayer wrote the memoir and biography ''[[Jack: C.S. Lewis and His Times]]''. In August [[1947]] Sayer also befriended [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].\n\nIn late August [[1952]] Tolkien visited Sayer and his wife and lent them the typewritten manuscript of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. During this visit, Sayer was to capture Tolkien singing and reading excerpts from ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and the manuscripts of ''The Lord of the Rings'' (see [[1952 tape recording]]).<ref>{{CG|RG}}, p. 876</ref>\n\nWhile preparing publication of ''The Lord of the Ring'', Tolkien was unable to write a brief (less than 100 words) sketch description of his work as a publicity blurb.
