South of the last outliers of the mountains it was joined by a tributary, the River [[Celos]].  At the point where it met the [[Anduin|Great River Anduin]], the port of [[Pelargir]] was built.<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Sirith'' means \"a flowing\" in [[Sindarin]].<ref>{{VT|42a}}, p. 11</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2014: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Sirith was in the area of Upper [[Lebennin]] in the Eastern [[Gondor]] region. It flowed through the fortified valley of [[Tumladen (Gondor)|Tumladen]] before turning west to meet the [[Celos]] below the [[Warning beacons of Gondor|beacon]] \"Sirthanc\". The town of \"Erynos\" was located on the western shore across from where the two rivers met. South of the juncture, the two joined rivers flowed south from the beacon to the [[Anduin]], forming the boundary with Lower Lebennin and the region of Central Gondor. The combined river also bisected the port city of [[Pelargir]] where it joined the [[Anduin]]. The Sirith was the domain of the honest River-maid Truetongue, one of the Five Sisters, though she and her sisters were widely considered a myth by the time of the [[War of the Ring]].\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Gondor]]\n[[Category:Rivers]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]"}}}
