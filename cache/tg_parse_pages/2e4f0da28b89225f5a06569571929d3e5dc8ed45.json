As was the custom in the \"younger\" families when there was no male heir, the headship passed to the daughter's eldest son. He would then use his mother's name, and add his father's to it. Thus, the Sackville-Baggins branch was created.<ref name=\"L214\"/>\n\nOtho married [[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins|Lobelia Bracegirdle]] of [[Hardbottle]], and the two had one child, [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins|Lotho]].<ref name=\"Bag\"/> Despite being the heir of the wealthy<ref>{{L|25}}</ref> Sackville Family, the Sackville-Bagginses yearned for the headship of the Baggins Family, and more specifically, their residence, [[Bag End]], the residence of [[Bilbo Baggins]].

However he did invite them to [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|his birthday party]] and they decided to come, thanks to the luxurious invitation card (written with golden ink) and the reputation of Bilbo's tables. During his speech he made a special mention to them, thanking and welcoming them, but they scowled hearing that Frodo (whom they detested) came into Bilbo's inheritance; they also felt insulted when he revealed that the guests were supposed to fill a [[One Gross|Gross]], as if they had been invited only for this reason. When Bilbo said farewell and disappeared at the end of his speech, they left enraged.<ref name=\"Party\"/>\n\nThe [[23 September|next day]] they heard that Bilbo's household is giving out for free, and demanded to see Frodo and offensively offered him bad bargain-prices for various valuable things, but Frodo replied that the things given away were parting gifts directed by Bilbo, and only a case of silver spoons was for them. Otho accused Frodo for \"doing exceedingly well out of it\" and demanded to see Bilbo's will (without which Otho would be Bilbo's heir).<ref name=\"Party\"/>\n\nAfter Frodo's departure, Bag End was sold to Lobelia, but Otho had died.<ref name=\"Party\">{{FR|Party}}</ref> \n</noinclude>\n\n==Genealogy==\n<noinclude>The Sackville-Bagginses were descendants of Mungo Baggins, like Bilbo.

Tolkien did not like the Norman conquest of Britain, and made the Bagginses English. The name ''Sackville'', however, is very Norman, as one of the few, if not the only, Hobbit family name.<ref>[[Tom Shippey]], ''[[J.R.R.

Rateliff]] stated that the change to \"Sackville\" was penciled in about the time the story was being prepared for publication in [[1936]].
