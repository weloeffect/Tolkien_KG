Hordern was invented for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'' by [[Amazon Studios]].\n\n== History ==\nThe Southlanders of Hordern were notable for being the descendants of [[Easterlings (First Age)|Men]] with especially strong loyalty to [[Morgoth]]. [[Bronwyn]] was born and raised in Hordern for many years before she moved to the nearby village of [[Tirharad]].\n\nWhen a cow belonging to [[Tredwill]] begins to show signs of sickness, [[Arondir]] and Bronwyn journey to Hordern to investigate.\n\nJust before arriving at Hordern, Arondir mentions how the people of Hordern were descended from the most devoted followers of Morgoth, Bronwyn defends them, claiming that there were good people who lived there.\n\nWhen Bronwyn and Arondir arrive at the village, they find the village burnt to the ground and the inhabitants missing. Bronwyn suggests that it could not have been a ground quake. Upon further investigation, the two of them discover a tunnel that was dug beneath the house of [[Ciaran]] and his wife [[Hana]]. Bronwyn leaves to warn the villagers of Tirharad while Arondir entered the tunnel to investigate further.\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) locations]]"}}}
