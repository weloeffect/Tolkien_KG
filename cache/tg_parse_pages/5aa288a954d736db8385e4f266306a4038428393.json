Remember you are over the Edge of the Wild now, and in for all sorts of fun wherever you go''.\"\n\nA failed robbery, the daring of two Hobbit brothers, a terrible crime, the flight of the Elves, the affairs of Wizards, black treachery, an ancient threat - seven stories to be told in the Twilight of the Third Age. Seven adventures need a company of heroes to undertake them.\n\nTales from Wilderland contains seven ready-to-play adventures, complete scenarios that can be played separately, or as an epic campaign spanning across a number of years. All adventures are set in the years after 2946, and take place in Wilderland.\n\nA wealth of background material expands the setting information contained in the core set for The One Ring, the newest fantasy roleplaying game based upon The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, the world-renowned masterpieces written by J.R.R. Tolkien.\n\n''Will you dare enter the great forest of Mirkwood, journey under the shadow of the Misty Mountains, visit the house of Beorn, follow the River Anduin down to the Gladden Fields, or climb the Grey Mountains to look upon the Withered Heath?''\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.cubicle7.co.uk/our-games/the-one-ring/the-one-ring-tales-from-wilderland/ Official page]\n\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:The One Ring (role-playing game)]]"}}}
