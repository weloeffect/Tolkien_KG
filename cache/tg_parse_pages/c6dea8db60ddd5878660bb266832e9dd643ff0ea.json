The [[River Running]] sprang from beneath the mountain and issued from the [[Front Gate]] of the [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] in the mountain wall, forming a waterfall that fell into the valley below. The river flowed briefly south and then made a great eastward loop. After almost completing its loop, the river flowed west for a while and then continued to flow south to the [[Long Lake]]. The town of Dale was located near the southern end of the valley nestled within the eastward loop of the river on its western side.<ref>{{H|Thror}}</ref>\n\nAn old road ran from the Front Gate of the Lonely Mountain along the eastern bank of the River Running down into the valley and then led to the east towards the [[Iron Hills]]. A road branched off to the west to a bridge at the beginning of the eastward bend of the river where it crossed over the River Running. From the western end of the bridge, one road ran east to the town of Dale and another road ran in the direction of [[Ravenhill]].<ref>{{HH|7ii}}</ref>\n\nDale was known as a merry town that traded, mainly in food-supplies, for the skills and craft-pieces of the [[Dwarves of Erebor|Dwarves]]. Fathers from Dale paid handsome amounts to the Dwarves to take their sons as apprentices, and the town of Dale became famous for wonderful and magical toys. Trade flowed up and down the River Running to and from [[Lake-town]] on the Long Lake and beyond.<ref name=\"Party\">{{H|Party}}</ref> The town was also renowned for its bells.<ref>{{H|Rest}}</ref><ref>{{H|Doorstep}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Angus McBride - Dale.jpg|thumb|left|[[Angus McBride]] - ''Dale'']]\n===Foundation===\nThere is no record of when Men first settled in the valley of Dale. It is implied that Men were already living in or near Dale and were joined by refugees of the [[Northmen]] after the latter were defeated by the [[Wainriders]] in the [[Battle of the Plains]] in {{TA|1856}}.<ref>{{UT|Northmen}}, \"were merged with the folk of Dale under Erebor\"</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|2590}},<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2590, p. 1087</ref> King [[Thrór]] reestablished the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] in the [[Lonely Mountain]]<ref name=\"Durin\">{{App|Durin}}, entry for King Thrór, p. 1072</ref>. The Dwarven kingdom prospered and in those days, [[Men]] living to the south gradually spread up the River Running as far as the valley and built the town of Dale.<ref name=\"Party\" /> The town shared in the prosperity of the Dwarves<ref name=\"Party\" /> and it was initially governed by the [[Lord of Dale]], of whom the last was named [[Girion]]<ref name=\"Fire\">{{H|Fire}}</ref>.\n\n===Destruction===\nIn {{TA|2770}},<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2770, p. 1087</ref> the dragon [[Smaug]] attacked the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] and the town of Dale<ref name=\"Durin\" />. Although the [[Men of Dale]] fielded warriors against the monster, they could not prevent him from killing or scattering the Dwarves and then occupying the Lonely Mountain. After the attack the dragon would crawl out of the [[Front Gate]] of the Mountain by night and carry away people (especially maidens) from Dale to eat. The remaining population soon fled and the deserted town fell into ruins.<ref name=\"Party\" /> Among the survivors of the ruin of Dale were Girion's wife and child who escaped down the River Running.<ref name=\"Fire\" />\n\n===Re-establishment===\nIn {{TA|2941}}<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2941, p. 1089</ref> [[Bilbo Baggins]], a member of [[Thorin and Company]] sneaked into the Lonely Mountain causing the angered dragon to attack<ref>{{H|Inside}}</ref> and destroy [[Lake-town]] in the [[Long Lake]]<ref name=\"Fire\" />. During the defence of Lake-town [[Bard]], a descendant of Girion, managed to kill Smaug with the [[black arrow]] from his yew bow.<ref name=\"Fire\" />\n\nThree years after the killing of Smaug, Bard rebuilt Dale and became the [[King of Dale]].<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2944, p. 1089</ref> Dale soon again enjoyed prosperity. Men from the Long Lake, the South, and the West came to Dale and the whole valley became tilled again. [[Lake-town]] was rebuilt and grew wealthy from trade up and down the River Running.<ref>{{H|Stage}}</ref> The people of Dale became known as the [[Bardings]], after their new ruler.<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}, p. 229</ref><ref>{{TT|Riders}}, p. 431</ref>\n\nBard was succeeded by his son, [[Bain]] in {{TA|2977}}.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2977, p. 1090</ref>\n\n[[File:Jan Pospisil - Dale units vs. Rhun.jpg|left|thumb|Jan Pospisil - ''The Battle of Dale'']]\n===Later history===\nIn {{TA|3007}} [[Brand]], the son of Bain, became the King of Dale.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 3007, p. 1090</ref> During his reign his realm extended far south and east of [[Lake-town]].<ref name=\"Meetings\" /> The eastern border of his realm is not recorded, but it may have been as far east as the river [[Carnen]].<ref name=\"Council\">{{FR|Council}}, pp. 241-2</ref><ref name=\"Great\">{{App|Great}}, entry about the events in the North, p. 1095</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|3017|n}}, a messenger from [[Mordor]] came to the [[Dwarves of Erebor]] and they found out that messengers from Mordor had also come to King Brand in Dale.

On [[17 March]], the [[Battle of Dale]] began. King Brand and King [[Dáin II Ironfoot]] were both killed and the [[Men of Dale]] and the Dwarves were driven into the Mountain. The enemy could not take the gates and a siege began.<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019, March 17, p. 1094</ref> However, when news of the [[Downfall of Barad-dûr|fall of Sauron]] came the enemy forces lost heart,<ref name=\"Great\" /> and on [[27 March]]<ref>{{App|Chief}}, entry for the year 3019, March 27, p. 1095</ref> the besieged Dwarves and Men burst forth from the mountain and the new King of Dale, [[Bard II]], and the new [[King under the Mountain]], [[Thorin Stonehelm|Thorin III Stonehelm]], drove the enemy away and the Easterlings troubled the kingdom of Dale no more<ref name=\"Great\" />.\n\nKing Bard II sent an ambassador to the crowning of King [[Aragorn|Elessar]].
