This version appeared in ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]''.\n\nThe ''The Root of the Boot'' version was set to the tune of ''The Fox Went Out'', and was first published as the 22nd song in ''[[Songs for the Philologists]]'' in [[1936]]. This version was reprinted in ''[[The Poetry of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'' and ''[[The Tolkien Papers]]'' ([[1967]]), and ''[[The Annotated Hobbit]]'' ([[1988]]). A revised form appeared in ''[[The Return of the Shadow]]'' in [[1988]].\n\n[[Image:Songs for the Philologists page 1.jpeg|thumb|250px|The poem as it appears in ''[[Songs for the Philologists]]'']]\n\nTolkien later revised the poem as ''The Stone Troll'' and included it in ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'' in 1962. [[Pauline Baynes]], who illustrated ''The Adventures of Tom Bombadil'', depicted Tom who kicked the troll with his ''boots'' as [[Tom Bombadil]]; although the name was most probably generic and there is no evidence that the author intended Tom to be Bombadil, as having an uncle and father would be absurd.\n\n[[Robert Foster]] considers a possibility that Tom was somehow modelled after Bombadil, considering that Sam composed the poem soon after their meeting.<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 385</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Poems in The Lord of the Rings|Poems in ''The Lord of the Rings'']]\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://digital.library.leeds.ac.uk/10486/ ''The Root of the Boot'' manuscript] at University of Leeds\n\n{{references}}\n{{poems}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stone Troll}}\n\n[[Category:Poems in The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]\n[[Category:Poems in The Fellowship of the Ring]]"}}}
