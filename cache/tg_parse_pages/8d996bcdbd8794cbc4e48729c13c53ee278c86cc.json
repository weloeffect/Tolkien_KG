He is played by [[Timothy Bartlett]].\n\n==History==\nWhile he was selling tubers near the market at the [[Green Dragon]] inn, Master Worrywort encountered [[Bilbo Baggins]]. Bilbo had just encountered [[Gandalf]] and had declined the [[Wizards|Wizard's]] proposal of going on an adventure. Bilbo asked Worrywort if he had seen a Wizard around, and Worrywort replied that had not. Bilbo then immediately ran away after spotting what he thought was Gandalf's hat.\n\nLater, while [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] was leaving for the [[Quest of Erebor]], Master Worrywort asked him where he was off to.\n\nAfter Bilbo's adventure, Worrywort was the first to acknowledge him upon his return to the Shire. He explained to Bilbo that, because he had been gone for so long, he had been presumed dead. As such, all of Bilbo's possessions were being auctioned off, one of which Master Worrywort was carrying back home with him.<ref>''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]''</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Hobbits from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Hobbit (film series) characters]]\n\n[[fi:Master Worrywort (elokuvahahmo)]]"}}}
