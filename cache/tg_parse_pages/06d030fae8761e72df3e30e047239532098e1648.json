With this character compendium you can meet Middle-earth's most exciting figures! Call them forth to add drama and danger to your fantasy game. Debate Gríma Wormtongue, challenge Ar-Pharazôn! Could you outride the Riders of Rohan or withstand the overwhelming presence of the Witch-king of Angmar? \n\nThis volume describes the Secondborn, the second race to enter Tolkien's world, the Men. Mortal, they dominate the later history of Middle-earth, and their influence increasingly colors the nature of life in Endor.
