He was notable for his treachery of [[Tinwelint]], King of [[Artanor]].\n\n==History==\n===Treasure of Glórund===\nUfedhin was a very wealthy [[Gnome]] who dwelled in Artanor. When [[Húrin|Úrin]] brought the treasure of [[Nargothrond]] before Tinwelint as a payment for his \"fair keeping\" of his wife and children, Tinwelint, on the advice of [[Melian|Gwendelin]], wanted to throw the treasure into the river. However, Ufedhin attempted to convince him otherwise and, due to the curse of [[Mîm]] the Dwarf, Tinwelint decided to keep the treasure.\n\nUfedhin - who was a close friend of the [[Dwarves]] of [[Nogrod]] - convinced Tinwelint to ask for their aid in the reshaping of the gold. When they agreed to work for Tinwelint, he sent half of the gold to Nogrod as a loan and kept the other half, which they were bidden to remake and reshape into many different objects.\n\nHowever, Tinwelint was already blinded by greed and decided to take Ufedhin as a hostage so that the Dwarves would not trick him. This angered Ufedhin and caused him to plot revenge on the King. When the Dwarves finished their work (including the [[Nauglafring]], the Necklace of the Dwarves), Ufedhin convinced them to ask the King to pay an exorbitant price. Upon hearing this price, the King ordered Ufedhin and the Dwarves to be whipped and paid them a pittance for their work.\n\n===Death of Tinwelint and Sack of Artanor===\n[[Naugladur]], King of the Indrafangs, heard the news of what had happened in Artanor and also received a message from [[Bodruith]], King of [[Belegost]], of the death of Mîm and the true nature of the acquisition of [[Glorund]]'s gold. He was furious and decided to wage a war against Tinwelint.\n\nUfedhin offered to guide the armies of Nogrod and Belegost through the [[Girdle of Melian|Girdle]] around Artanor. At that time, another Elf from Artanor named [[Narthseg]] revealed to Naugladur that Tinwelint would commemorate the [[Hunting of the Wolf]] with a great hunt in the woods near the borders of Artanor.\n\nIn these woods, Tinwelint was slain by Naugladur, and the army of Nogrod ravaged Artanor. Coming to Menegroth, with Naugladur holding Tinwelint's head and bearing the Nauglafring around his neck, Ufedhin walked to the throne of Tinwelint and sat right next to his wife Gwendelin, who reprimanded him for his actions. This tongue-lashing would continue to haunt Ufedhin.\n\nOn the way back to Nogrod, Ufedhin tried to slay Naugladur in his sleep, lusting for the Nauglafring. Bodruith, who also lusted after the necklace, tried to kill Ufedhin in turn, but was slain by him. At that Naugladur awoke, but Ufedhin had already fled. While he was fleeing he was caught by the [[Green-elves]] led by [[Beren]] who had already heard about the sack of Artanor and Tinwelint's death by Gwendelin. However, he concealed his identity and told Beren where Naugladur and his host would pass on their way back to Nogrod.\n\nIn the end, when Beren's army annihilated the Dwarves and Beren himself slew Naugladur, Ufedhin saw Gwendelin for the final time. He could not endure the sight of her, and fled screaming in pain and terror. None knew what became of him after this.<ref>{{LT2|IV}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Ufedhin'' is a [[Gnomish]] word meaning \"outcast, outlaw\" or \"one who changes his clan and goes to a new kinship\".<ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 74</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Gnomes]]\n[[Category:Gnomish names]]"}}}
