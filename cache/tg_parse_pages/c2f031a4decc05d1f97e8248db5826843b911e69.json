The event happened after the coming of [[Eriol]], a [[Men|human]] mariner, to Tol Eressëa at the beginning of the ''Lost Tales''.<ref name=\"Forth\">{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''5''', pp. 283-4</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Prelude ===\nAccording to one outline, the Elves of the Great Lands led an uprising against the [[Orcs]] and the [[Dwarves]]; and, while the time was not yet deemed ready for the Faring Forth, the Elves judged it necessary.\n\nTherefore, they sought [[Ulmo]]'s help, who sent [[Uin]], his great [[Whales|whale]], to uproot the island of Tol Eressëa and drag it across the [[Belegaer|Ocean]], in order to anchor it off the coast of [[Rôs]], a promontory in the Great Lands. From there, a magic bridge was cast across the [[wikipedia:English Channel|strait]] between Rôs and Tol Eressëa.\n\nHowever, [[Ossë]] in his wrath at the uprooting of the island he set in place so long ago, tried to wrench it back towards [[Valinor]] - and in doing so, the western portion of the island of Tol Eressëa broke off, and became the Isle of [[Íverin]], which would later become known as [[wikipedia:Ireland|Ireland]].<ref name=\"Forth\"/>\n\n=== Battle of Rôs ===\nRegardless, after the arrival of the Elves of Tol Eressëa to the Great Lands, they were soundly defeated in the [[Battle of Rôs]] by Orcs and evil Men. The remaining Elves afterwards retreated to Tol Eressëa and hid in its woods, because the island was now overrun by Men, as well as Orcs, Dwarves, [[Gongs]], [[Trolls]] and all other evil creatures.<ref name=\"Forth\"/>\n\nIn the above outline, that battle was to be the beginning of the end for Elves, since they would eventually fade and most Men would not be able to even perceive them anymore.<ref name=\"Forth\"/><ref name=\"Sky\"/><ref group=\"note\">It is said that the Elves grew dim, transparent and small, as the Men grew in power, until all that remained of them was \"memories faded dim, a wraith of vanishing loveliness in the trees, a rustle of the grass, a glint of dew, some subtle intonation of the wind\".</ref>\n\n=== Battle of the Heath of the Sky-roof ===\nHowever, there is another outline, in which, during the inevitable fading of the Elves, there was a [[Battle of the Heath of the Sky-roof|great battle]] between the last remnants of the Elves and faithful Men against other, hostile factions of Men at the [[Heath of the Sky-roof]], not far from the town of [[Tavrobel]].<ref name=\"Forth\"/><ref name=\"Sky\">{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''8''', pp. 287-8</ref>\n\nEriol, and the fading Elves, witnessed the battle and fled across the rivers [[Gruir]] and [[Afros]] - and in the battle's aftermath, Eriol wrote the last words of the ''Lost Tales'' in the abandoned Tavrobel before he sealed the book.<ref name=\"Sky\"/><ref group=\"note\">In another text, it wasn't Eriol who witnessed the battle and wrote down the last words of the book, but an unknown man, who in the prologue to the ''Lost Tales'' was supposed to find the book written by Eriol years prior.</ref>\n\n=== Aftermath ===\nAccording to yet another text, after Eriol's death, his sons [[Hengest]], [[Horsa]], and [[Heorrenda]], conquered the island and the land which later became known as England - however, they were ''not'' hostile to the Elves, and from them the [[wikipedia:English people|English]] people retain \"the true tradition of the fairies\". Hengest settled in a city known before as [[Kortirion]] which would afterwards be known as [[wikipedia:Warwick|Warwick]]. Horsa settled into the town of [[Taruithorn]], which would later be known as [[Oxford]]. Heorrenda made his dwelling in [[Tavrobel]], which eventually became known as [[wikipedia:Great Haywood|Great Haywood]].<ref name=\"Heo\">{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''13''', pp. 291-3</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\n=== Eriol as the instigator of the Faring Forth ===\nIn one text, following the ones given above in the main section of the article, Tolkien decided to increase the importance of Eriol by making him instrumental in the initiation of the Faring Forth.\n\nThere, Eriol, filled with longing for his home, decided to leave Tol Eressëa before Faring Forth has taken place against the command of [[Meril-i-Turinqi]], the Lady of Tol Eressëa, taking his son Heorrenda with him. However, the purpose of his departure was also to hasten the Faring Forth, and, once back in his homeland, he \"preached\" of it.\n\nFinally, once the Faring Forth has taken place, the invading groups of Men called the [[Guiðlin]] and the [[Brithonin]],<ref group=\"note\">In some versions, another group called the ''[[Rúmhoth]]'' (identified with the [[wikipedia:Romans|Romans]]) also joined the invasion.</ref> attacked Tol Eressëa, now located in the geographic location of England. Somewhere around that time Eriol died, however his sons Hengest and Horsa managed to conquer the Guiðlin. Unfortunately, because of Eriol's haste and disobedience to Meril, the Faring Forth was doomed, and the Elves ultimately faded away because of it.<ref name=\"Eri\">{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''14''', p. 294</ref>\n\n=== Ælfwine replaces Eriol ===\nWhen [[Tolkien]] reimagined the ''Lost Tales'' as being recorded by an [[wikipedia:Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] mariner [[Ælfwine]], as opposed to the character of ''Ottor Wǽfre'', an ancestor of the Anglo-Saxons, he also reimagined the nature of the framework and the conclusion to the ''Lost Tales''.<ref name=\"Lut\">{{LT2|VI}}, pp. 300-1</ref>\n\nIn this new framework, the idea of the dragging of Tol Eressëa across the ocean to become England disappears - in its stead appears the idea of [[Luthany]], an island off the coast of the Great Lands, to which it was once connected to, and which would eventually become the island of [[wikipedia:Great Britain|Great Britain]].<ref name=\"Lut\"/>\n\nInstead of the Faring Forth as envisioned in the texts above, the (First) [[War of Wrath|Faring Forth]] became identified with the march of the Elves of [[Kôr]] to the Great Lands to free the enslaved [[Gnomes]] and their war with evil Men following that.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, p. 308</ref>\n\n==== Ælfwine and Ing ====\nThe remainder of the Elves, after their war with the evil Men, moved to Luthany, which was ruled by a [[Men|Mannish]] king called [[Ing]]<ref name=\"Ing\">{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''18''', pp. 302-3</ref> - he, unlike most other Men, was friendly to the Elves, which is why most of the Elves of the Great Lands moved to his lands.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''21''', p. 304</ref>\n\nHowever, after the disappearance of Ing, and the subsequent invasions by unfriendly Men, the vast majority of the Elves on the island moved to Tol Eressëa.<ref name=\"Sec\">{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''22''', pp. 305-6</ref>\n\nIn one outline, it was prophesied that Ing would one day lead the Elves of Tol Eressëa to conquer back Luthany, in an event called the '''''Second Faring Forth'''''.<ref name=\"Sec\"/><ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''27''', p. 307</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[March of Liberation]]\n* [[Dagor Dagorath]]\n\n{{references|notes}}\n[[Category:Conflicts in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Events]]\n[[Category:Tol Eressëa]]"}}}
