It is comprised of three major sections. Firstly, there is a strategy guide which provides insight into deck design and play focusing on cards from MEAS. This section also features actual tournament ready decks. Secondly, there is black and white high resolution reproduction of each card from MEAS. Finally, there is a section of featured card topics.
