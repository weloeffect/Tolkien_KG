Thondir was invented for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'' by [[Amazon Studios]] and he is portrayed by [[Fabian McCallum]]. He appears only on the first episode of the first season of the show.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9788618/fullcredits|articlename=Full Cast & Crew|dated=|website=IMDB|accessed=5 August 2022}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nIn the [[Second Age]], Thondir accompanied [[Galadriel]] to the [[Northern Waste]] in search of [[Sauron]], though he and the other Elves of their company were against the idea: other companies had already searched Forodwaith for that \"last stronghold\" ([[Dúrnost]]) and had never found anything. \n\nThondir didn't want to visit the region not only because it had already been searched before by other companies, but also because it was such a cold region that even sunlight feared to tread there. It is also mentioned that their orders were to have returned to Lindon months before and that the only reason they hadn't done so yet was because of Galadriel's orders. \n\nAfter being attacked by a [[Snow-trolls|snow-troll]] in Dúrnost and almost dying, Galadriel orders the company to go even further north. In this moment, Thondir and the other Elves refused to fulfill Galadriel's orders and decided to go back to Lindon. Galadriel, who woudn't dare venturing into those regions alone, went back to Lindon with her company. \n\nUpon there return to Lindon, Thondir was granted by [[Gil-galad]] permission to return to [[Valinor]], which he later does.\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Elves from adaptations]]"}}}
