Centuries later, after Turgon and his people had abandoned the region for [[Gondolin]], Tuor found and used both the Gate of the Noldor and Cirith Ninniach to escape from Hithlum.<ref>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>\n\nTuor found the Cirith Ninniach by following a stream that flowed from [[Dor-Lómin]] to the [[Ered Lómin]] and then disappeared into a great arch in a wall of rock.  At first he though that there was no passage but then he saw two [[Elves]] issue from the archway. [[Gelmir (messenger of Círdan)|Gelmir]] and [[Arminas]] they were, and they told him that he had found the [[Gate of the Noldor]].  The two Elves led Tuor into the tunnel beside the stream and down long flights of steps. They left Tuor beside a waterfall and he continued until he emerged into a narrow ravine that ran straight into the West. In the pass the stream rushed over falls and wove rainbows; thus he named the ravine Cirith Ninniach.\n\nTuor traveled in the pass for four days, watching the stream turn into a river fed by shimmering falls that descended the walls of Cirith Ninniach. The pass ended when the river met the sea in the narrow Firth of Drengist.<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Cirith Ninniach'' is [[Sindarin]], glossed as \"Rainbow Cleft\" in the narrative, but it could literally mean \"Pass of the Slender Crossing\", from ''[[cirith]]'' (\"cleft, pass\"), ''[[ninn]]'' + [[iach]]'' (\"ford, crossing\").\n\nEarly [[Gnomish]] names for the pass were ''Cris Ilbranteloth'' (\"Gully of the Rainbow Roof\") and ''Glorfalc'' (\"Golden Cleft\").<ref>{{LT2|Gondolin}}, p. 150.
