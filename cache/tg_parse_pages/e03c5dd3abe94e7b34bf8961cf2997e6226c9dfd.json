They travelled upriver on the road next to the river, climbed the stairs cut into the rock beside the Stair Falls, and discovered that the Sirannon had been dammed. There was now a lake so wide that the great roots of two very large holly trees next to the West-gate reached from the wall of the cliff to the water of the lake.<ref name=Journey/> After [[Boromir]] threw a stone into the lake, the Watcher in the Water nearly caught the Ring-bearer [[Frodo Baggins]]. The Fellowship of the Ring fled from his attack into Moria, but the Watcher in the Water, with a noise of rending and crashing, closed the doors of the West-gate with its tentacles, thus blocking the exit through the Doors of Durin.<ref>{{FR|Journey}}, p. 308</ref>\n\nMoria was eventually resettled by [[Dwarves]] during the [[Fourth Age]].<ref name=Fourth>{{PM|Aiv}}, p. 278</ref> As a consequence, it is possible that the dam was removed and that the original course of the Sirannon was restored.\n\n==Etymology==\nSirannon is a [[Sindarin]] name.<ref name=Eldamo>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-1333188901.html|articlename=S.
