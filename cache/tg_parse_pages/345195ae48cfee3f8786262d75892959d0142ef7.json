During their migration they joined the [[Drúedain]] near the [[White Mountains]] and stayed with them on friendly terms.{{fact}}\n\nWhen the core of their team was pressed to wander on, some Drúedain accompanied them northwards{{fact}}, passing through the [[Gap of Rohan|opening between]] the [[Misty Mountains]] and the [[White Mountains]]. Many stayed behind because of the dense forest covering the [[Minhiriath]] and the western half of [[Enedwaith]] between the [[Greyflood]] and the [[Isen]] and became herd-tenders. Their descendants were peoples in the forests of the shore-lands south of the [[Blue Mountains]], especially in Minhiriath<ref>{{PM|X}}</ref>\n\nTheir kin of the White Mountains apparently were later driven off (from the most part) by [[Men of Darkness]] during the [[Dark Years]], removed to the southern dales of the [[Misty Mountains]] and thence some passed into the empty lands until the [[Barrow-downs]], from whom came the [[Men of Bree]].<ref name=F>{{App|Men}}</ref>\n\n===In Beleriand===\n[[File:Steamey - Funeral of Haldad and Haldar.jpg|thumb|''Funeral of Haldad and Haldar'' by [[:Category:Images by Steamey|Steamey]]]]\nThe Haladin entered Beleriand in {{FA|312}}.<ref>{{WJ|14}}, p. 227</ref> They came secretly in small parties in the woods of [[Ossiriand]], and were in strife among themselves. The [[Laegil]] were unfriendly to them. Their numbers are not known, but they were probably more than 2000.<ref name=atani>{{PM|Atani}}</ref>\n\nUnlike The [[House of Bëor]] before them and the [[House of Hador]] after, they did not advance to [[Estolad]] but instead dwelt without leave in the south of [[Caranthir]]'s realm of [[Thargelion]].<ref name=guide/> The Haladin had no overall leader and so settled in scattered groups in that region. \n\n[[Morgoth]] already knew about the coming of hostile Men to Beleriand and sent his servants to afflict the Haladin.<ref name=atani/> So their style of living came to an end in {{FA|375}} when a host of orcs assaulted their territory. In answer to this [[Haldad]] took command of the people, building [[Gelion-Ascar Stockade|a stockade between]] the angle of the rivers [[Gelion]] and [[Ascar]] south of [[Sarn Athrad]]. There he led the [[Battle of the Gelion-Ascar Stockade|defence of his people]] until he and his son [[Haldar]] were slain whereupon his daughter [[Haleth]] took up the leadership of the house and held out for a week until Caranthir's army could relieve them.<ref name=guide/> \n\nIn honour of the valiance of Haleth, Caranthir offered the House of Haleth a feif in his lands but Haleth declined and instead led her people away passing through Estolad and [[Nan Dungortheb]] before temporarily inhabiting [[Talath Dirnen]]. King [[Thingol]] of [[Doriath]] granted to Haleth the [[Forest of Brethil]] on condition that she defended the [[Crossings of Taeglin]]. She led then her people (now known as the '''Halethrim''', the '''House of Haleth''' in her honour) and they settled as woodsmen centered around the capital of [[Amon Obel]]. For the following years they guarded the northern flank of [[Nargothrond]].<ref name=guide/> Both Doriath and Brethil refused to play any great part in [[Battles of Beleriand|the war]] of the [[Noldor|Ñoldor]] and their allies and only seldom did the Haladin march to war alongside them. \n\nEventually Haleth died but as she had produced no heirs the title of [[Chieftain of the Haladin]] returned to her brother Haldar's line and to his son [[Haldan]]. During his rule, in {{FA|436}}<ref>{{GA|161|note}}</ref> there was a great feast of the Edain, when two of his grandchildren married into the [[House of Hador]]; [[Haldir (Chieftain of the Haladin)|Haldir]], his heir married Hador's daughter [[Glóredhel]], while [[Hareth]] married Hador's son [[Galdor (Lord of Dor-lómin)|Galdor]].<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> Hareth's famed sons [[Húrin]] and [[Huor]] were fostered for a while by Haldir in Brethil. \n\nHaldan ruled for 31 years before dying leaving the leadership of the house to his son [[Halmir]]. Four years after in {{FA|455}}, [[Morgoth]] broke the [[Siege of Angband]] in the [[Dagor Bragollach]]. As usual, the Halethrim played no active part in the battle but fought the hosts of orcs that threatened their realm with the aid of the [[Sindar]] of Doriath under [[Beleg|Beleg Cúthalion]]. \n\nAfter the loss of [[Dorthonion]], their numbers were joined by refugees from the [[House of Bëor|First House]].<ref name=guide/> \n\nAfter the fall of [[Minas Tirith in Beleriand|Minas Tirith]], the Haladin were harassed by frequent Orc-raids in the Crossings from [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]].<ref name=guide/>\n\nWhen the [[Union of Maedhros]] was formed, Halmir offered the aid of the House of Haleth and made preparations for war but a year prior to the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] he died and the promise was left for his son Haldir to fulfill. Haldir took part in the battle where the Haladin covered the retreat of [[Fingon]] and suffered heavy losses on [[Anfauglith]]. Haldir was slain alongside his brother [[Hundar]].<ref name=guide/>\n\nThe son of Haldir [[Handir]] took up the leadership but he himself was slain in one of the many orc raids on Brethil at that time and the position passed to his son [[Brandir]]. Their defeat allowed the forces of the enemy to access and [[sack of Nargothrond|sack Nargothrond]].<ref name=guide/>\n\n=== Decline ===\nAfter the death of [[Handir]] the Haladin dwindled and became more reclusive but survived on. They remained in their woods, occasionally ambushing Orcs at the Crossings.<ref name=guide/>\n\nIt was during the reign of Brandir that [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]] son of Húrin came to Brethil and became in all but name its leader, leading them in warfare in much the same manner as he had the elves of [[Nargothrond]]. Túrin's presence brought the dragon [[Glaurung]] to Brethil and though Túrin succeeded in slaying the beast, he slew Brandir in a rage as the final threads sparing him from his doom unravelled. Túrin's suicide ended that period in the history of the Haladin.\n\nBut their dealings with Húrin and his cursed kin were not yet over for Húrin himself came among them after twenty eight years of captivity in Angband. Now a broken man he succeeded in sparking a civil war in the House of Haleth owing to his perception of the treatment of his [[Morwen|wife]] whom he found at the [[Stone of the Hapless|grave of their children]]. [[Obel Halad]] was burnt and all potential heirs slain or driven away in the anarchy that followed.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, pp. 291-4</ref> In that way did the House of Haleth cease to be in the year {{FA|500}}. The Drúedain who had dwelt in Beleriand were reduced to a few families of mainly women and children, who fled to the [[Mouths of Sirion]].<ref>{{UT|Druedain}}, third paragraph</ref>\n\nFew of the Folk of Haleth had survived the [[War of Wrath]] and the ruin of Beleriand,<ref>{{PM|Ros}}, Note 17</ref> and in the [[Second Age]] some of them, with the Drúedain living with them, settled the island of [[Númenor]] with the other Edain.<ref>{{UT|12c}}, note 7</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Turner Mohan - Haleth and guardswomen.jpg|thumb|''Haleth and guardswomen'' by [[:Category:Images by Turner Mohan|Turner Mohan]]]]\nLittle information is given as to the physical characteristics of the House of Haleth, save for the fact that they were shorter in stature than those of the House of Bëor.<ref name=Druedain>{{UT|12c}}, note 2</ref><ref name=West>{{S|West}}</ref> The were described as being similar in appearance to members of the House of Bëor, suggesting dark or brown hair and grey eyes.<ref name=West/>\n\nThe Haladin belonged to a different branch than the other Edain of the west, and differed in a number of ways. They spoke [[Halethian]], an unrelated dialect of [[Mannish]],<ref name=\"guide\" /> and although some of them learned [[Sindarin]] to communicate with the [[Eldar]] and the other Edain, they were not fluent in it.<ref name=atani/>\n\nTheir numbers were fewer<ref name=guide/> and their birth rates were slightly enough to compensate for their losses to the war; women were fewer than men, and many remained unwed.<ref name=atani/><ref name=note>{{PM|XNotes}}, #50</ref>\n\nThey were secretive and conservative, unwilling to adopt new things and customs, remaining apart, preferring solitude and to protect their woodlands instead of allying themselves with the [[Elves]] and participating to the greater events. They had their own customs and practices that seemed strange to the Elves and Edain alike, like their ancient practice of having women warriors and amazons (like Haleth, who had a picked bodyguard of women),<ref name=atani/> perhaps owing to their small numbers.<ref name=note/>\n\nIndeed, they excelled in forest warfare, and Orcs, even especially trained for this, dared not to cross their borders. They had a few dealings with the outsiders except their participation to the War where they proved loyal allies; reflecting their population, they sent small companies (rarely women<ref name=note/>) beyond their borders, who were esteemed as redoubtable warriors.<ref name=atani/> \n\nIn battle they bore axes.<ref name=\"guide\">{{HM|Guide}}, entry \"Haladin\"</ref>\n\n==Other names==\n'''''Haladin''''' is the [[Mannish]] term for this house, literally meaning \"Wardens\".<ref name=Wardens>{{WJ|I}}, p. 270</ref> '''''Halethrim''''' is the rarely seen [[Sindarin]] rendering for \"People of Haleth\".<ref>{{CH|17}}, p. 247</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\nIn the notes to the ''[[Wanderings of Húrin]]'', [[Christopher Tolkien]] points out an interesting usage of the term ''Haladin''. It would seem that [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] at some point intended ''Haladin'' to refer only to the House of Haleth and not the Folk of Haleth as a whole.<ref name=Wardens/> In an isolated slip, headed ''Names'', Tolkien also considered changing the term for a ruler of the People of Haleth from ''Halad'' to ''Halbar'', meaning \"Chieftain.\"<ref>{{WJ|I}}, p. 309</ref>\n\nWhether this definition of ''Haladin'' would have survived into the final intent is questionable. This article takes the more widely used definition of referring to the entire People of Haleth.\n\n==Genealogy==\nA dagger symbol '†' signifies those who did not die of old age.
