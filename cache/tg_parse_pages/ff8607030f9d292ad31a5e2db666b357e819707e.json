Bombur's distinguishing characteristic was his size, for he was the fattest of the thirteen Dwarves.<ref name=\"Party\"></ref> After the death of Smaug, Bombur lived at the Lonely Mountain.<ref name=\"Meetings\">{{FR|II1}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Family and birth===\nBombur's parentage is unknown; the only familial connections mentioned are his brother [[Bofur]] and his cousin [[Bifur]].<ref name=\"Flies\">{{H|Flies}}</ref> Bombur was not of [[Durin]]'s line, although he was descended from the Dwarves of [[Moria]].<ref name=\"Durin\">{{App|Durin}}</ref> His birth year is also unknown.\n\nHowever, in [[Bilbo Baggins]]' account of the quest to Erebor he stated that the brothers [[Fíli]] and [[Kíli]] were the youngest of the thirteen \"by some fifty years\",<ref name=\"Hill\">{{H|Hill}}</ref> and that when Thorin was missing [[Balin]] was \"the eldest left\".<ref>{{H|Barrels}}</ref> Since Kíli was born in {{TA|2864}} and Balin was born in {{TA|2763|n}},<ref name=\"Durin\" /> this would put Bombur's birth between {{TA|2763|n}} and c. 2814, and he would have been between c. 127 and 178 years old during the quest to Erebor.\n\nPrior to the quest, Bombur probably lived in the [[Blue Mountains]] with Thorin after the loss of [[Thráin|Thráin II]].{{fact}}\n\n===The Quest of Erebor===\nIn {{TA|2941}},<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> Bombur was one of the four Dwarves in the fifth group to arrive at [[Bag End]]. When Bilbo jerked open his door the four fell on top of one another, with Thorin on the bottom and fat Bombur on top. Bombur wore a pale green hood and asked for pork-pie and salad for his refreshment. When Thorin later called for music, Bombur played a drum.<ref name=\"Party\" />\n\nWhen the company dealt with the [[trolls]], before the trolls could capture Bombur, he and Bifur fought like mad and were especially troublesome for the trolls to capture. Because of the resistance he and Bifur put up the trolls put him near their fire.<ref name=\"Mutton\">{{H|Mutton}}</ref> Bombur expressed disappointment that Bilbo had tried to steal the troll's purse instead of heading straight back and telling the company what he'd found.\n\nRunning from the [[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|Goblins]] through their tunnels, Bombur carried Bilbo for part of the way, although he grumbled about it as he staggered with sweat dripping from his nose.<ref name=\"Hill\" />\n\nIn the glade of the [[Wargs]] Bombur shared a pine tree with Bifur, Bofur, and Thorin.<ref name=\"Pan\">{{H|Pan}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Gandalf]] was telling the story of the company's adventures to [[Beorn]], Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur were the last of the Dwarves to show up. Gandalf had told Bombur to arrive last and alone because he was the fattest, but the offended Dwarf had refused to wait.<ref name=\"Queer\">{{H|Queer}}</ref>\n[[File:Alan Lee - Bombur slept on with a smile on his fat face.jpg|thumb|right|\"Bombur slept on with a smile on his fat face\" by [[Alan Lee]]]]\nBombur's most notable \"adventure\" occurred at the [[Enchanted River]]. Beorn had warned them about its water<ref name=\"Queer\" /> and they did try to cross without touching it, but due to the charge of the deer, Bombur fell into the river. The company threw him a rope and he caught it, but upon landing he fell into an enchanted sleep. For six days the company took turns carrying the slumbering Dwarf. When finally awake he had forgotten everything since the quest began and lamented waking up to no food, since he couldn't eat anything while he was asleep for six days, and since the company had eaten the rest of the food the night before and saved none for him. Bombur felt weak and wobbly in the legs and sat down and wept. Bombur began to tell the rest of the dwarves about his beautiful dreams, but Thorin told him to be quiet and declared that everyone was annoyed with Bombur and that they should have abandoned him if he hadn't woken up when he did, and pronounced Bombur's dreams to be idiotic. When they were walking that day, Bombur kept on wailing that his legs wouldn't carry him. The others rebuffed him and refused to assist him. After a day of this, Bombur had had enough and refused to take another step. He flung himself to the ground and told them that that they could go on without him if they had to and that he was going to dream of food, if he couldn't get it any other way. He finished by exclaiming he hoped he never woke up again.\n\nIt was then that the first of the feasts of the [[Elves of Mirkwood|Elves]] appeared north of the path. Bombur wanted to go to the lights, since his memory of the journey had been wiped clean and he didn't remember the warnings was for rushing to it but was restrained by the caution of the others, although Bilbo interceded for him. When they did attempt to enter the feasts everything vanished and eventually all of the Dwarves except Thorin were captured by the [[spiders]]. After the spiders had strung up the Dwarves, all of the dwarves were noted to be underfed, despite Bombur being the fattest of the bundles. Bombur was chosen to be killed first, but Bombur managed a weak kick which knocked the spider off the branch, which only briefly delayed the spider's attack and momentarily humiliated his tormentor. Due to this activity and everything else he had endured, Bombur was nearly exhausted; when freed he fell off his branch and luckily had his fall cushioned by leaves. He was noted to have been pinched and poked, and it could only have been the spiders or the impatient dwarves.<ref name=\"Flies\" />\n\nAfter the barrel ride down the [[River Running]] Bombur was found to be asleep or senseless.<ref>{{H|Welcome}}</ref>\n\nWhile the rest of the company climbed up to the \"doorstep\" on the side of the Lonely Mountain, Bombur and Bofur remained in the valley to tend to the ponies. While Bofur was willing to ascend by rope for changes of the guard, Bombur demurred, claiming that he was too fat for such sky-walks and he would either grow dizzy or the rope would break.<ref>{{H|Doorstep}}</ref> However, when Smaug came roaring out to scour the mountainside Bombur was hauled up the cliff, puffing and blowing.\n\nWhen Thorin called for a siege and refused to negotiate, the other dwarves all seemed to share his mind except for Bombur, Fíli, and Kíli. Though Bombur later admitted to Bilbo that he was hesitant to defy Thorin to his face.<ref name=\"H|Thief\">{{H|Thief}}</ref>\n\nWhen Bilbo was going out to deliver the Arkenstone to elves and men, Bilbo passed him, invisible, sneaking out with the arkenstone, but stopped when he saw Bombur sitting on the edge of a cliff. Bombur lamented to Bilbo how cold it was, and Bilbo urged him to come inside where it was warmer. Bombur agreed, but grumbled that he couldn't come inside because he was out on watch duty until midnight. The two have a chat about how they both think Thorin is being unreasonable, Bombur felt it was a \"sorry business altogether\" and deemed Thorin \"ever a dwarf with a stiff neck\". Bilbo wishes to feel the grass beneath his toes, and Bombur longs for a soft bed, a strong drink, and a good supper, Bilbo offers to take Bombur's watch. Bombur did sleep and thanked Bilbo later when the Hobbit woke him up after midnight.<ref name=\"H|Thief\" />\n\nBombur fought in and survived the [[Battle of Five Armies]]. He was given his share of the treasure by [[Dáin Ironfoot]], and made his home in Erebor.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>\n\n===Later life===\nAt [[Rivendell]] in December, {{TA|3018}}, [[Glóin]] told [[Frodo Baggins]] that Bombur was still alive and living in Erebor. In fact, Bombur appeared to have used some of his wealth to increase his girth – he was unable to move alone from couch to table and required the aid of six young Dwarves to lift him.<ref name=\"Meetings\" /> Given his age and immobility it is doubtful that Bombur fought in the [[Battle of Dale]].\n\n==Etymology==\nBombur, or ''Bumburr'', is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''.
