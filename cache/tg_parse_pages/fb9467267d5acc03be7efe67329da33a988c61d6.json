These labels could suggest that Forodwaith was a part of the wider Northern Waste, if not a smaller separate region. This nomenclature was carried over to [[Pauline Baynes]]'s ''[[A Map of Middle-earth]]''.\n\nLater, Christopher Tolkien realized that the two names certainly seem to have been intended as synonymous, because Forodwaith seems to be explicitly equated with the Northern Waste in one of J.R.R.
