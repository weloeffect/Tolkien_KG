The scroll held Isildur's account of the gaining of the [[The One Ring|Ring]] from [[Sauron]] and described the appearance of [[Ring Verse|an inscription]] around the Ring while it was still hot. The Scroll was stored for millennia in the vaults of that city and according to Gandalf it was probably forgotten after the time of the [[Kings of Gondor]] and nobody, except him and perhaps [[Saruman]], had seen it. \n\n[[Gandalf]] started to believe that [[Bilbo Baggins]]' Magic Ring was the One. In {{TA|3017}} he visited Minas Tirith and studied the scroll. Isildur's description was vital in helping [[Gandalf]] identify the Ring. He visited [[Frodo Baggins]] in [[Bag End]] and tested his ring in the fireplace, confirming it as the One Ring of Sauron.<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref><ref>{{FR|I2}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''\n:Gandalf visits Minas Tirith to discern the identity of Bilbo's Ring. A brief scene shows him guided to the vaults by a [[Gondorians|Gondorian]] keeper and reading the scroll, which is an elaborate prop in [[Tengwar]] calligraphy.
