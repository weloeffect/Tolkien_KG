See {{App|SA}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nHazad was described in his youth as being \"broad, swarthy, short, though, harsh-tongued, heavy-handed, and quick to violence.\" <ref>{{PM|Elmar}}</ref> Hazad’s sons are said to resemble him in his youth.\n\nThough he found pride in the number of his descendants, his greatest joy was his beard, long over five feet and, unlike his sons, soft, “ruly to his hand,” and close to him all the time.\n\nHazad married late, due to the admiration he had for his late mother, Elmar. He fathered many children, including [[Tal-Elmar (character)|Tal-Elmar]], who was his seventeenth child.  \n\nAlong with his youngest son, he delivered the ill message to [[Mogru]] of [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] ships approaching the Hills of Agar.\n\n== Etymology ==\nSome analysts have noticed the similarity of ''Hazad'' with [[Khuzdul|Dwarvish]] ''[[Khazâd]]'', \"Dwarves\", and [[Adûnaic]] ''hazad'', \"seven\". The name would then either mean \"Dwarf (bearded, smaller one)\" or \"Seventh child\", however, this remains speculation.<ref>[[Andreas Möhn|Andreas Moehn]], ''[http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Fr_Atani.html Etymologies of the Atani languages]''</ref>\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| BUL |y| ELM |~|~|~|~|~|~|y|~| HUS |BUL=[[Buldar]]<br /><small>''fl. {{SA}}''</small>|ELM=[[Elmar]]<br /><small>''fl. {{SA}}''</small>|HUS=''Unknown husband''<br /><small>''fl. {{SA}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| |,|-|^|-|.| | | | | | | |!| | | |}}\n{{familytree| CHI | | HAZ |y| WIF | | UNK | | | | |CHI=''Unknown children''|HAZ='''HAZAD LONGBEARD'''<br /><small>''fl. {{SA}}''</small>|WIF=''Unknown wife''<br /><small>''fl. {{SA}}''</small>|UNK=''Unknown children''}}\n{{familytree| | | | | |,|-|^|-|.| | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | | | SON | | TAL | | | | | | |SON=''Sixteen sons''|TAL=[[Tal-Elmar (character)|Tal-Elmar]]<br /><small>''fl. {{SA}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nHazad Longbeard originally had the name of '''Tal-argan Longbeard'''.\nIn a penciled note [[J.R.R.
