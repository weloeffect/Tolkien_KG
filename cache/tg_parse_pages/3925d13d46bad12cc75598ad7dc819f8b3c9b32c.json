At some point in his life, he was wounded by an arrow, but survived after the [[Wizards|wizard]] [[Gandalf]] healed his arrow-wound. Thenceforth, the Great Eagle held Gandalf in friendship.<ref name=fire/>\n\nDuring the [[Quest of Erebor]] in {{TA|2941}}, the Great Eagle and many of his servants saved [[Thorin and Company]] from [[Orcs]] and [[Wargs]] and brought them to the Eyrie, where they spent the night.<ref name=fire/>\n\nLater that year, the Eagles appeared many hours into the [[Battle of Five Armies]] by the [[Lonely Mountain]], and were crucial in the victory over the Orcs and Wargs.<ref>{{H|17}}</ref> After the battle, the Great Eagle was proclaimed '''King of All Birds''', and was given a golden crown while his fifteen chieftains were each given golden collars.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn an early draft of the chapter \"[[Out of the Frying-Pan into the Fire]]\", the Great Eagle is referred to as \"the '''lord of eagles'''\" and \"the '''[[Lord of Eagles]]'''\" while his arrow-wound is stated to have come from a goblin's arrow.<ref>{{HH|VI}}</ref> In an early draft of the chapter \"[[Queer Lodgings]]\", the Great Eagle's title was changed to the [[Lord of the Eagles]] and he was given the title '''king of all Birds'''.<ref>{{HH|VII}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===The Great Eagle in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Hobbit (1977 film) - Lord of the Eagles.png|[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1977 film)]]\n</gallery>\n'''1980: ''[[Der Hobbit (1980 German radio series)|''Der Hobbit'' (1980 German radio series)]]'':'''\n: In the [[1980]] German radio series adaptation, Friedrich W. Bauschulle voiced the Lord of the Eagles.\n\n==Speculation==\nIt is often thought that the Great Eagle is the same individual as [[Gwaihir]], however it is more than likely that they are not the same one. Among several points which separate the two, the Great Eagle is mentioned to wear a crown after ''[[The Hobbit]]'' but no crown is mentioned with Gwaihir in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Furthermore, Gandalf states that he was carried by Gwaihir three times, including following the [[Battle of the Morannon]],<ref name=\"RKVI4\">{{RK|VI4}}</ref> whereas the number would be at least five if Gwaihir and the Lord of the Eagles were one and the same.\n\nIt is also possible that the Great Eagle was [[Thorondor]],<ref name=speculation>[https://www.reddit.com/r/tolkienfans/comments/z1rtab/the_real_lord_of_the_eagles/ The real Lord of the Eagles] on reddit.com</ref> who also bore the title [[Lord of the Eagles]].\n\n{{References}}\n\n{{Eagles}}\n\n[[Category:Characters in The Hobbit]]\n[[Category:Eagles]]\n[[Category:Rulers in Middle-earth]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]"}}}
