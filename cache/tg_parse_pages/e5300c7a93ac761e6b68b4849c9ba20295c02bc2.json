These two names were most likely phonological imitations of the name ''Heorrenda'' instead of being translations of its meaning.\n\nThe first element of ''Heruven'' is probably ''[[heru]]'' (\"lord\"), while the second element of ''Herwent'' is most likely ''[[gwent]]/gwenn/gwen'' (\"large, big; fine\") - hence ''Heruven'' and ''Herwent'' might mean \"great lord\".<ref name=Hen/>\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | WOD | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |WOD=[[wikipedia:Odin|Wóden]]<ref name=\"Her\"/>}}\n{{familytree | | | |:| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | |:| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | HED | | | | | | | | | | | | | | TUL | | | | VAL |HED=[[Heden]]|TUL=[[Tulkastor]]|VAL=[[Valwë]]}}\n{{familytree | |,|-|^|-|.| | | | | | | | | | | |,|-|^|-|.| | | |!| |}}\n{{familytree | BEO | | EOH | | | | | | | | | | SIB | | VAI |~| LIN |BEO=[[Beorn (son of Heden)|Beorn]]<br /><small>''d.

It is possible that ''Horwin'' might have been a slip for '''''Herwin''''', though in the old German poem ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kudrun Kudrun]'', the form ''Horund'' (or ''Horant'') appears for the name ''Heorrenda'', which might have inspired the Gnomish name of ''Horwin''.<ref name=Lus/>\n\n=== Later genealogy ===\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | LIN |y| VAI |LIN=[[Lindo]]|VAI=[[Vairë (wife of Lindo)|Vairë]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |!| | | |}}\n{{familytree | AEL |y| EAR | | |AEL=[[Ælfwine]]|EAR=[[Earissë]]}}\n{{familytree | |,|-|^|-|.| | | |}}\n{{familytree | HEO | | HLU | | |HEO='''HEORRENDA'''|HLU=[[Hlúdwine]]}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n== Inspiration ==\nThe name ''Heorrenda'' appears in the Old English poem ''Déor'', where Heorrenda was a bard that has supplanted Déor, another bard and the main character of the poem, in their lord's favour.\n\nIn some of [[Tolkien]]'s lectures on the poem ''[[Beowulf (poem)|Beowulf]]'', he named the unknown author of the poem as ''Heorrenda''.<ref>{{LT2|VIb}}, p. 323</ref>\n\n{{references|notes}}\n[[Category:Angles]]\n[[Category:Anglo-Saxons]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Chroniclers of Arda]]\n[[Category:Old English names]]\n[[Category:Rulers in Tol Eressëa]]"}}}
