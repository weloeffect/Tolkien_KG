Tolkien]] edited and published by [[Christopher Tolkien]]. It is in its entirety an excerpt from a much longer unfinished essay titled ''[[Of Dwarves and Men]]'', the rest of which was published in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]''.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe essay speaks about the [[Drúedain]], little-appearing in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. It explores their history during the [[First Age]] being a part of the [[House of Haleth|Second House]] of [[Men]], and later their temporary presence on [[Númenor]] and then their staying in [[Andrast]].\n\nIt is mentioned about their being confused with [[Orcs]] and the [[Rohirrim]] hunting and killing them in their ignorance.\n\nThere is a mention of their peculiar \"[[magic]]\" abilities and customs, exemplified in the First Age story ''[[The Faithful Stone]]''.\n\nAmong the [[Atani]], the [[Folk of Haleth]] were the strangest. They kept to themselves, and had their own language. Among the Folk of Haleth, a small group of people named the Druedain were even stranger.\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Druedain, The}}\n\n[[Category:Drúedain]]\n[[fi:Drúedain (KTK)]]"}}}
