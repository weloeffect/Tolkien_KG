Tolkien: A Brief Account of the Book and its Making''''' is a pamphlet published by [[Christopher Tolkien]] soon after the publication of ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. The text was reprinted in ''[[Mallorn (journal)|Mallorn]]'' [[Mallorn 14|n. 14]] (1980, pp.&nbsp;3–5, 7-8).\n\n==Excerpt==\n\"[F]or a time, I worked toward a book that would show something of this diversity, this unfinished and many-branched growth. But it became clear to me that the result would be so complex as to require much study for its comprehension; and I feared to crush ''The Silmarillion'' beneath the weight of its own history. I set myself, therefore, to work out a single text, by selection and arrangement.\" (p.&nbsp;4)\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.tolkienestate.com/writing/christopher-tolkien-the-silmarillion/ Full text] at the [https://www.tolkienestate.com/ Tolkien Estate official website]\n\n{{title|italics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Silmarillion by J.R.R.
