They were loaded with all kinds of burdens, and the smallest one was for [[Bilbo Baggins]]. The ponies were captured by [[Orcs#Goblins|Goblins]] in the [[Front Porch]].<ref>{{H|Hill}}</ref> [[Beorn]] also used ponies and lent some of his to the Dwarves up to their way to [[Mirkwood]], provided that they would release them by the [[Forest Gate]]. Although some considered breaking their promise, [[Gandalf]] warned them that Beorn had been following them as a bear, and would be watching them. Reluctantly, they released the ponies and sent them back to Beorn.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref> The dwarves were provided ponies again by the [[Lake-men|people]] of [[Lake-town]] on their way to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]].<ref>{{H|Doorstep}}</ref>\n\n[[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] had some ponies in his house at [[Crickhollow]]. He had prepared five of them ([[Sharp-ears]], [[Bumpkin]], [[Wise-nose]], [[Swish-tail]], and [[White-socks]], who at that time were unnamed) for [[Frodo Baggins]] and their friends on their way to [[Bree]].<ref>{{FR|Conspiracy}}</ref> In the [[Old Forest]], the ponies stayed with [[Tom Bombadil]]'s pony, [[Fatty Lumpkin]], and became friends. \n\nAt Bree, spies let the ponies run to the wild to hinder the hobbits (eventually they returned to Fatty), so [[Samwise Gamgee]] bought one from [[Bill Ferny]], a sick and mistreated pony, which Sam also named [[Bill the Pony|Bill]].<ref>{{FR|Knife}}</ref> Bill was released outside the [[Doors of Durin]] as he could not follow the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] inside [[Moria]].<ref>{{FR|Journey}}</ref> He found his way back to Bree.\n\nMeriadoc was given the pony [[Stybba]] by [[Théoden]].<ref>{{RK|V2}}</ref> Stybba carried Merry through the mountain passes from the [[Hornburg]] east and south to [[Dunharrow]] and thence northward to [[Edoras]]. \n\nIn [[Minas Tirith]], Frodo named his new pony [[Strider (pony)|Strider]] after [[Aragorn]]'s nickname. With him, he rode back to [[the Shire]].<ref>{{RK|Partings}}</ref> At Bree, the Hobbits found all their former ponies safe at the [[the Prancing Pony|''Prancing Pony'']], having returned there.<ref>{{RK|Homeward}}</ref> \n\nFrodo and Sam eventually rode Strider and Bill to the [[Grey Havens]] two years later.<ref>{{RK|Havens}}</ref>\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Images of ponies|Images of ponies]]\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Horses]]"}}}
