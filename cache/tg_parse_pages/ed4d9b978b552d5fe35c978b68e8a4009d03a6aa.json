There, they built the city of Koromas, later known as ''Kortirion'' due to the [[Tirin na Gilweth|great tower]] that Ingil built there at the topmost part of the city.<ref name=\"Ala\"/>\n\nIt was also where the [[Cottage of Lost Play]] could be found, which [[Eriol]], the [[Men|Mannish]] mariner, visited on his sojourn in Tol Eressëa.<ref name=\"Ala\"/> Another place in the city that he visited was the home of [[Meril-i-Turinqi]],<ref group=\"note\">According to one rejected text, the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Erinti]] also dwelt in Alalminórë after the arrival of Elves to Tol Eressëa.

One of them was [[Hengest and Horsa|Hengest]] son of [[Eriol]], who invaded Kortirion, and made it his capital, afterwards known as ''Warwíc'' and eventually as ''Warwick'' - with Alalminórë, the region surrounding Warwick, becoming known as ''Warwickshire''.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, p. 293</ref><ref>{{LT1|In}}, p. 25</ref>\n\n== Etymology and names ==\nThe name ''Alalminórë'' is in [[Qenya]], meaning the \"Land of [[Elms]]\". It consists of the elements ''[[alalmë]]'' (\"elm\") + ''[[nórë]]'' (\"land\").<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3369572157.html|articlename=ᴱQ.

In that reimagining of the [[legendarium]], Tol Eressëa ceased to be identified with [[wikipedia:England|England]]/[[wikipedia:British Isles|British Isles]] - instead, it became a completely different island, and [[wikipedia:Great Britain|Great Britain]] became the island of [[Luthany]], while the mariner that came there was called [[Ælfwine]], an [[wikipedia:English people|Englishman]] sailing ''from'' England.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, pp. 300-1</ref>\n\nSo, as opposed to the previous conception, where the Elves of the Great Lands sailed directly to Tol Eressëa following the defeat of Melko in the March of Liberation, the Elves now sailed to Luthany instead.\n\nThere, they built many cities and settlements - and, after their ''eventual'' return to Tol Eressëa, named many places there ''after'' the ones in Luthany. For example, the city of Kortirion (the New) in Tol Eressëa was named after Kortirion the Old (i.e. Warwick) in Luthany.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''27''', pp. 307-8</ref>\n\nIn one text from c. [[1920]], called ''[[Ælfwine of England]]'', '''Alalminórë''' (Warwickshire) is mentioned as the region surrounding the town of Kortirion (the Old) ruled by [[Óswine (Prince of Gwar)|Óswine]], the Prince of Gwar, who was friendly to the Elves that still lived on the island, many of whom congregated in Alalminórë.<ref>{{LT2|VIb}}, pp. 313, 324</ref>\n\n=== Later legendarium ===\nIn the later [[legendarium]], there appears the [[Quenya]] name '''Alalvinórë''', glossed as the \"Land of Many Elms\".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 153</ref> It consists of the elements ''[[alalvëa]]'' (\"having many elms\") + ''[[nórë]]'' (\"land, country\").\n\nSince this name was never used in any narrative, however, it is unclear how it would have been applied in the post-''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' mythology.\n\nThe name itself was changed from the earlier forms ''Alalminórë'' and ''Alalbinórë''.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3669988095.html|articlename=Q.

[[1962]].<ref>{{LT1|Kortirion3}}, p. 40</ref>\n\n== Inspiration ==\nAlalminórë was inspired by [[wikipedia:Warwickshire|Warwickshire]], a region of [[wikipedia:England|England]] in which the town of [[wikipedia:Warwick|Warwick]] (which served as the inspiration for the city of Kortirion) is situated in.<ref>{{LT1|In}}, pp. 24-5</ref>\n\n{{references|notes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Alalminore}}\n[[Category:Locations in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Luthany]]\n[[Category:Qenya locations]]\n[[Category:Quenya locations]]\n[[Category:Regions]]\n[[Category:Tol Eressëa]]\n[[de:Alalminóre]]\n[[fi:Alalminórë]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/regions/alalminore]]"}}}
