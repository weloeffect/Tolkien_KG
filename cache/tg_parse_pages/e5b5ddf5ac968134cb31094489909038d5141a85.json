But it's less an academic lecture and more a nerdy hangout! We combine our in-depth study with a healthy dose of self-effacing humor, pop culture references, and bad puns. It's our goal to make even Tolkien's deepest works accessible to anyone; and we do this by being the sort of guys you'd want to hang out at a pub and talk Tolkien with.<ref name=\"about\" />|The Prancing Pony Podcast}}\n\n==Seasons==\n*Season 1 (2016) ''[[On Fairy-Stories]]'', ''[[Mythopoeia]]'', and ''[[The Silmarillion]]''\n*Season 2 (2017) ''[[The Hobbit]]''\n*Season 3 (2018) ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Book I, the first half of ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''\n*Season 4 (2019) ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Book II, the second half of ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''\n*Season 5 (2020) ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Book III, the first half of ''[[The Two Towers]]''\n*Season 6 (2021) ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Book IV, the second half of ''[[The Two Towers]]''\n*Season 7 (2022) ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Book V, the first half of ''[[The Return of the King]]''\n*Season 8 (2023) ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Book VI, the second half of ''[[The Return of the King]]''\n\n==Moots==\nIn May [[2021]], PPP hosts and their team organized a fully online conference, [[Prancing Pony Podcast Moot]].\n\nIn October [[2022]], the PPP hosted a hybrid moot, online and in-person at [[Marquette University]] to coincide with [[William M.
