Then it tells of [[Lúthien]]’s return and their dance, and how [[Daeron|Dairon]] espied them, and as he loved Lúthien he betrayed them to [[Thingol]].  Then how Lúthien led Beren into [[Menegroth]] after Thingol promised her that his life would be spared. There he requested the hand of Lúthien, and Thingol, as he was bound to his oath not to harm Beren, in his wrath gave the bride-price as a [[Silmarils|Silmaril]]. Then Beren laughed as if it were a small thing, and left the hall with the promise to bring one back. This fourth canto can be considered the true beginning of the [[Quest for the Silmaril|Quest]].\n\n== Concerning the Canto ==\nThis Canto begins with an elaborate description of Beren's happiness.\n{{blockquote|He lay upon the leafy mould<br>\nhis face upon the earth's bosom cold<br>\naswoon in overwhelming bliss<br>\nenchanted of an elvish kiss|vv. 758-761}}\n\nThen they dance in joy together.\n{{blockquote|there flitting just before his feet<br />\nshe gently chid with laughter sweet;<br />\n'Come! dance now, Beren, dance with me!<br />\nFor fain thy dancing I would see.'|vv. 820-823}}\n\nThen Dairon, who is said to have loved Lúthien, espies them. \n{{blockquote|Thus fleeting fast their short hour flies,<br>\nwhile [[Dairon]] watches with fiery eyes,<br>\nhaunting the gloom of tangled trees<br>\nall day, until at night he sees<br>\nin the fickle moon their moving feet,<br>\ntwo lovers linked in dancing sweet|vv. 840-845}}\n\nAnd he first casts a spell of silence on the wood, and gives hints to Thingol about the meeting.\n{{blockquote|'but kings see not—though queens, maybe,<br>\nmay guess, and maidens, maybe, know.<br>\nWhere one went lonely two now go!'|vv. 917-919}}\n\nThe King understands swiftly his meaning, and grows angry.\n{{blockquote|'...Who is he<br>\nthat earns my wrath? How walks he free<br>\nwithin my woods amid my folk,<br>\na stranger to both beech and oak?'|vv. 922-925}}\n\nThen Dairon saw Lúthien, and wished he had not spoken.  Lúthien quickly explains.\n{{blockquote|'Far in the mountain-leaguered North,<br>\nmy father,' said she, 'lies the land<br>\nthat groans beneath King Morgoth's hand.<br>\nThence came one hither, bent and warn<br>\nin wars and travail, who had sworn<br>\nundying hatred of that king;<br>\nthe last of [[Bëor]]'s sons, they sing|vv. 931-937}}\n\n{{blockquote|'...a sword unconquered, neck unbowed,<br>\na heart by evil power uncowed.<br>\nNo evil needst thou think or fear<br>\nof Beren son of Barahir!'|vv. 942-945}}\n\nLúthien had Thingol swear not to kill or imprison Beren, and then led him to and into Menegroth.  A vibrant description follows (see ''[[Menegroth]]'').  Beren was too stunned to answer any questions, until he looks in Melian's eyes and gains courage.\n{{blockquote|...and thence was slowly drawn his gaze<br>\nto Melian's face. As from a maze<br>\nof wonder dumb he woke; his heart<br>\nthe bonds of awe there burst apart<br>\nand filled now with the fearless pride of old;<br>\nin his glance now gleamed an anger cold.|vv. 1040-1045}}\n\nHe speaks bravely to Thingol about his love for Lúthien:\n{{blockquote|'Thy dearest treasure I desire;<br>\nnor rocks nor steel nor Morgoth's fire<br>\nnor all the power of Elfinesse<br>\nshall keep that gem I would possess.<br>\nFor fairer than are born to Men<br>\nA daughter hast thou, Lúthien.'|vv. 1050-1055}}\n\nDaeron's initial anger returns and he demands death for Beren.  Thingol reluctantly restrains himself due to his promise to his daughter, and threatens to let him wander interminably in Menegroth, never finding his way out of the caves.  Beren openly compares him with Morgoth in the twisting of oaths, and holds up the [[Ring of Barahir]].  Melian whispers to Thingol that it will not be by his hand Beren will fall, and Thingol sees then the love of Lúthien for him.\n{{blockquote|'Fairest of Elves! Unhappy Men,<br>\nchildren of little lords and kings<br>\nmortal and frail, these fading things,<br>\nshall they then look with love on thee?'|vv. 1113-1116}}\n\nThingol's speech mocks Beren's own as he places the ultimate quest before him.\n{{blockquote|'A treasure dear I too desire,<br>\nbut rocks and steel and Morgoth's fire<br>\nfrom all the powers of Elfinesse<br>\ndo keep the jewel I would possess.<br>\nYet bonds like these I hear thee say<br>\naffright thee not.  Now go thy way!<br>\nBring me one shining Silmaril<br>\nfrom Morgoth's crown, then if she will,<br>\nmay Lúthien set her hand in thine;<br>\nthen shalt thou have this jewel of mine.'|vv. 1122-1131}}\n\nFollows is a paragraph about the history of the Silmaril, and then Beren laughs, and bids farewell to Tinúviel, and departs. Melian then gets her word in to Thingol.\n{{blockquote|Then clear in the silence the cold words rang<br>\nof Melian: 'Counsel cunning-wise,<br>\n'O king!' she said. 'Yet if mine eyes<br>\nlose not their power, 'twere well for thee<br>\nthat Beren failed his errantry.<br>\nWell for thee, but for thy child<br>\na dark doom and a wandering wild.'<br>\n<br>\n'I sell not to Men those whom I love'<br>\nsaid Thingol, 'whom asll things above<br>\nI cherish; and if hope there were<br>\nthat Beren should ever living fare<br>\nto the Thousand Caves once more, I swear<br>\nhe should not ever have seen the air<br>\nor light of heaven's stars again.'|vv. 1189-1202}}\n\nThe final three lines wrap up this extensive canto, sad and foreboding.\n{{blockquote|But Melian smiled, and there was pain<br>\nas of far knowledge in her eyes;<br>\nfor such is the sorrow of the wise.|vv. 1203-1205}}"}}}
