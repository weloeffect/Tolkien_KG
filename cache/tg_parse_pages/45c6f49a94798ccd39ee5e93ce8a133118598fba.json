In return, Théoden promised that the people of [[Rohan]] would no longer trouble the Drúedain and would drive away the ''[[Gorgûn]]'' that hunted them.<ref name=\"Ride\" />\n\nFollowing the War of the Ring, [[Aragorn]], as [[High King of the Dúnedain|High King]] of the [[Reunited Kingdom]], issued the decree that the Drúadan Forest belonged to only Ghân-buri-Ghân and his people, and that no one else was allowed to enter the forest without their permission.<ref>{{RK|Partings}}, p. 976</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Ghân-buri-Ghân'' means \"Ghân son of Ghân\" in the [[Drúadan language|language]] of the Drúedain.

In this draft, '''Ghân of the Wild Woods''' approaches Aragorn with \"two of his headmen…clad all in garments of green leaves\" and bow to him. After Aragorn grants them possession of the forest, they bow once more before leaving.
