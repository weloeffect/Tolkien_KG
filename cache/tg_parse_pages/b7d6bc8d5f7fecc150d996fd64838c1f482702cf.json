Most of them were [[Noldor]].<ref>{{RGEO|Notes}}, p. 64</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Second Age===\nPreviously having been affiliated with either the [[Elves of Lindon]] or the [[Elves of Eregion]], the original Elves of Rivendell came together during the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]].\n\nAround the year {{SA|750}} the realm of [[Eregion]] was founded<ref>{{App|SA}}, entry for the year 750, p. 1083</ref> primarily, but not solely by [[Noldor]] [[Elves]]<ref name=\"UTC\">{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>.\n\nIn {{SA|1695}}, the forces of [[Sauron]] invaded [[Eriador]]. In response, King [[Gil-galad]] sent a host of Elves under the command of [[Elrond]] from [[Lindon]] to the help of the Elves of Eregion.<ref>{{App|SA}}, entry for the year 1695, p. 1083</ref> A force of Elves led by [[Celeborn]] sortied from Eregion, drove back the scouts and vanguard of the army of Sauron and joined the host of Elves of Elrond. However, they were not able to retreat to Eregion, because Sauron's army held them off and besieged Eregion.<ref name=\"UTC\" />\n\nAt last, in {{SA|1697}}<ref name=\"UTC\" /><ref>{{App|SA}}, entry for the year 1697, p. 1083</ref>, the forces of Sauron broke into Eregion and [[Sack of Eregion|sacked]] it. Sauron took the [[Nine Rings]], captured [[Celebrimbor]], the Lord of Eregion, and tortured him to divulge where the [[Seven Rings]] had been bestowed. He then attacked the host of Elrond who had assembled the few Elves that had been able to escape from Eregion. A force of [[Dwarves]] from [[Moria]] and Elves from [[Lothlórien]] led by [[Amroth]] sallied from Moria and attacked the rear of Sauron's army. Elrond was driven to the north and the [[Dwarves of Khazad-dûm|Dwarves of Moria]] and the [[Galadhrim|Elves of Lothlórien]] had to retreat into Moria and shut the [[Doors of Durin]]. Elrond and his forces retreated to the valley of Rivendell, where Elrond oversaw the creation of a refuge as a stronghold of the Elves in the east of Eriador.<ref name=\"UTC\" />\n\nIn {{SA|1700}}, a fleet from [[Númenor]] landed in Lindon and at the mouth of the [[Gwathló]]. Subsequently, the [[Númenóreans]] and the Elves of Lindon defeated the army of Sauron in three battles at the River [[Lhûn]], at [[Sarn Ford]] and at the [[Battle of the Gwathló|Gwathló]]. After that, the force of Sauron that was besieging Rivendell was attacked on two fronts by the forces of Gil-galad and Elrond and annihilated. It was decided that Rivendell rather than Eregion should be an Elvish stronghold in the east of Eriador. Gil-galad appointed Elrond as his vice-regent in Eriador and gave [[Vilya]], one of the [[Three Rings]] [[Rings of Power|of Power]] of the Elves, to him.<ref name=\"UTC\" />\n\nMore than 1,700 years later, in {{SA|3431}} the hosts of Gil-galad and [[Elendil]] of [[Arnor]] joined together in the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] and journeyed to Rivendell where they spent three years to prepare for war before continuing their march to [[Mordor]].<ref>{{App|SA}}, entries for they years 3431 and 3433, p. 1084</ref>\n\n===Third Age===\nThe Elves of Rivendell lived in peace for more than 1,300 years. Around {{TA|1300}}, [[Sauron|Sauron's]] [[shadow]] became stronger and evil things multiplied, heralded by the reappearance of the [[Nazgûl]].<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year ''c.'' 1300, p. 1086</ref> The [[Witch-king|lord of the Nazgûl]] came north and established the evil realm of [[Angmar]] between the [[Ettenmoors]] and the [[Mountains of Angmar]] on both sides of the [[Misty Mountains]], because he intended to destroy the [[Dúnedain of the North]] and to exploit the disunity of the splinter realms of [[Arthedain]], [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]]. He gathered many evil Men, Orcs and other fell creatures in Angmar and became known as the Witch-king of Angmar, but it was not known at that time that he was the lord of the Nazgûl.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, entry about King Malvegil, p. 1040</ref>\n\nIt is said that sometime between {{TA|1356}} and {{TA|1409|n}} Rivendell was under a siege.<ref name=\"ArvelegI\">{{App|Eriador}}, entry for King Arveleg I, p. 1040</ref> The identity of the besiegers is unknown, but it is possible that they were forces from Angmar. Eventually the forces of Angmar were subdued for a while by Elves from Lindon and Elves from Rivendell aided by [[Galadhrim|Elves from Lothlórien]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, entry for King Araphor, p. 1041</ref>\n\nIn the autumn of {{TA|1973}}, the kingdom of [[Gondor]] received messages that Arthedain was in great danger, because the Witch-king of Angmar was preparing an attack against it. In response, King [[Eärnil II]] of Gondor sent his son [[Eärnur]] north with a fleet as fast as he was able.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry about King Eärnil II, p. 1050</ref> Before the end of the winter of {{TA|1974|n}}, Angmar invaded Arthedain from the north.<ref name=\"Arvedui\">{{App|Eriador}}, entry about King Arvedui, pp. 1041-43</ref> The Witch-king overran Arthedain and conquered [[Fornost]] before the end of the year<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1974, p. 1086</ref> and drove away most of the remaining [[Dúnedain]] over the River<ref name=\"UTC\" /> [[Lhûn]], including the sons of the king.<ref name=\"Arvedui\" /> King [[Arvedui]] of Arthedain defended the North Downs as long as he could until he had to flee to the north with some of his guards on horses. Arvedui hid in tunnels of old dwarf-mines at the northern end of the [[Blue Mountains]] until his supplies ran out and then fled to a camp of the [[Lossoth]] at the southern shore of the [[Icebay of Forochel]] where he was forced to wait. The Elves of Lindon heard of the flight of Arvedui to the north and sent a ship to rescue him, but it sank shortly after retrieving Arvedui in the bay of [[Forochel]] when the ship was driven back to the ice by a storm and was crushed by further ice that was piled up against it in March<ref name=\"Arvedui\" /> of {{TA|1975}}.<ref name=\"TA1975\">{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1975, p. 1086</ref>\n\nWhen Prince Eärnur of Gondor arrived with his fleet at the havens of [[Lindon]] in {{TA|1975}}<ref name=\"TA1975\" /> it was too late, because Arthedain had already been conquered and King Arvedui was already dead. [[Círdan]] gathered a force from [[Lindon]] and [[Arnor]] and the combined forces of Lindon, Arnor and Gondor, which included tall and fair riders, princes from Rhovanion and horses from the [[Vales of Anduin]] crossed the River Lhûn and marched north. The Witch-king came from Fornost with the forces of Angmar to meet them, but was defeated in a battle on the plain between [[Lake Evendim]] and the North Downs. The Witch-king fled northwards with a remnant of his forces in the direction of Angmar, but his forces were overtaken by the cavalry of Gondor and by forces led by the Elf-lord [[Glorfindel]] who came north from Rivendell before they could reach the shelter of [[Carn Dûm]]. The Witch-king was able to escape from the north on a black horse, but the realm of Angmar was utterly defeated so that no Men and Orcs of Angmar remained on the west side of the Misty Mountains.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry about King Ondoher, p. 1049 and entry about King Eärnil II, pp. 1049-51</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Elven peoples]]"}}}
