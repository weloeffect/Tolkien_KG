As with all of the series it consisted of six characters in each of six ''[[Tyellë|tyeller]]'' or 'grades'.  This particular series took its name from the first of its signs, ''[[quesse]]'' (literally meaning 'feather', but here simply the character representing 'kw').\n\nUnlike [[Westron]] or other languages, Quenya needed a series of characters for labialized consonants.  Quenya writers used the third series of Tengwar characters for the [[Calmatéma]] (the k-series) and the fourth series for the Quessetéma (the kw-series).   In the Quessetéma, half of the symbols had one bow or ''[[lúva]]'' while the other half had two bows.  All bows in this series curved upwards and to the left from a stem, or ''[[telco]]'', which was either lowered, raised, or shortened, and all of the bows were closed with a bar across their opening.\n\nThe names of the letters in the Quessetéma were established in Quenya and had become standardised by the [[Third Age]].  The first four signs in the series were ''[[quesse]]'', ''[[ungwe]]'', ''[[hwesta]]'' and ''[[unque]]'', representing 'kw', 'gw', 'khw' and 'ghw', respectively.  The fifth sign, ''[[nwalme]]'' (earlier ''ngwalme''), represented 'ngw', while the sixth, ''[[vilya]]'' (earlier ''wilya'') was used for 'w'.<ref>{{App|Letters}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Lettering]]"}}}
