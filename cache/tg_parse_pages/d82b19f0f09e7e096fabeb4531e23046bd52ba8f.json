'''Ruling Queens of Númenor''' were women who ruled the kingdom of [[Númenor]]. Of Númenor's twenty-five [[King of Númenor|rulers]], three were female.  \n\n==Laws of Succession==\n{{Main|Law of Succession in Númenor}} \nIn the early days of Númenor, the custom (as there was no official law regarding succession) was that, once the King became too old to rule, he would surrender the [[Sceptre]] to his eldest son. If he had no son, the Kingship would pass instead to the nearest male relative of male descent of [[Elros Tar-Minyatur]]. Under this system it was impossible for a woman to become ruler of Númenor. In {{SA|892}}, [[Tar-Aldarion]] changed the system of succession to full agnatic primogeniture, in which the heir to the Kingship of Númenor would be the eldest child of the King or Queen regardless of gender.<ref name=\"Further\">{{UT|Wife}}, ''The Further Course of the Narrative''</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Tar-Ancalimë===\n[[File:Anke Eißmann - Ancalime in Emerie.jpeg|thumb|right|''Queen Ancalime the Princess Shepherdess'' by [[:Category:Images by Anke Eißmann|Anke Eißmann]]|200px]]\n[[Tar-Ancalimë]] ({{SA|873}}-{{SA|1285|n}}) was the first Ruling Queen of Númenor.<ref name=\"ancalime\">{{UT|5}}, entry ''VII Tar-Ancalimë''</ref> She was the only child of Tar-Aldarion, and under the old law the Sceptre would have passed to her cousin [[Soronto]].<ref name=\"aldarion\" /> In {{SA|892}}, at the age of nineteen,<ref group=\"note\">This was unusual as it had been previously customary for heir to be declared when he reached 100 years of age.</ref> she was declared the [[King's Heir]] by Tar-Aldarion, who changed the law to allow his daughter to rule.<ref name=\"Further\" />\n\nUnder the new law, the Queen was forced to resign after a certain time if she remained unwed or without children. This law was later changed by Tar-Aldarion, although it is not known whether this was before or after she married. Despite lacking any interest in men or marriage, she wed [[Hallacar]] in {{SA|1000}}. There are several accounts of why this may have happened: in one story, she agreed to marry him due to his persistence and the urgings of the [[Council of the Sceptre|Council;]] in another, it was to spite her cousin Soronto, who had long desired the position of King, and who tried to use both the law that she must wed and that she must have children.<ref name=\"Further\" />\n\nTar-Aldarion left her as Regent several times during his voyages.<ref name=\"Further\" /> Tar-Ancalimë become Queen in {{SA|1075}}.<ref name=\"aldarion\">{{UT|5}}, entry ''VI Tar-Aldarion''</ref> She reigned for 205 years, longer than any ruler after Elros; she surrendered the Sceptre in {{SA|1280}} to her son [[Tar-Anárion]], and died in {{SA|1285}}.<ref name=\"ancalime\" />\n\nAfter the death of her father, it is told that she neglected all her father's policies and gave no further aid to [[Gil-galad]] in [[Lindon]].<ref name=\"ancalime\" />\n\n===Tar-Telperiën===\n[[File:Juliana Pinho - Tar-Telperien.png|thumb|right|''Tar-Telperien'' by [[:Category:Images by Shyangell|Shyangell]]|75px]]\n[[Tar-Telperiën]] ({{SA|1320}}-{{SA|1731|n}}) was the second Queen of Númenor.
