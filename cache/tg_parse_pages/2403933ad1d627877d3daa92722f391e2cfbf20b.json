The [[Easterlings]] known as the [[Wainriders]] passed south of Mordor and made an alliance with the men of Khand and of [[Near Harad]]. In {{TA|1944}} they made a coordinated attack against [[Gondor]].<ref>{{UT|Northmen}}</ref><ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Ondoher, p. 1049</ref>\n\nYears later, Variags from Khand joined the forces of [[Sauron]] during the [[War of the Ring]].<ref name=\"Pelennor\" />\n\nIt is unknown if Khand was ever conquered by the [[Reunited Kingdom]] or if it remained independent. It is also unknown if Khand ever warred with the folk of the West after [[Sauron]]'s demise.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe meaning of ''Khand'' is unknown; it is, along with ''[[Variag]]'', one of the few known words from the languages of the Men of the East and allies of Sauron.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, carbon copy of typescript F4, p. 79</ref>\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''1984-1997: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]''''' \n:Khand is further fleshed out in the roleplaying game and its supplementary material. It is described as a hot and dry region.\n\n:The deserts and scrubland of Lower Khand were inhabited by horse herders who moved between water sources, with only a few permanent settlements along the Knife ([[Languages_in_Middle-earth_Role_Playing#Varadja|V]]. \"Noz Peka\"), a tributary river of the [[Harnen]]. The largest of these was Sturlurtsa Khand, the traditional capital at the confluence of the Knife and the Gold-horse (V. \"Medlóshad Peka\").\n\n:Upper Khand, the north-eastern part of Khand, was slightly cooler. Its capital was Ûbésêsh-ûta-Pavéter (V. \"Refuge from the Flailing Wind\"), upstream from the Sturlurtsa Khand. Its richer clans produced many kings, whose bones were entombed in shrines in the Caves of Ôlbamarl. [[Ninth of the Nazgûl|Ûvathar]] of the clan Achef, who later became a [[Nazgûl|Ringwraith]], was born in those caves.<ref>{{EndorMap|Khand}}</ref><ref>{{ICE|8003}}, pp. 96-98</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Eastern lands]]\n[[Category:Mannish realms]]\n[[Category:Regions]]\n[[Category:Southern lands]]\n[[de:Khand]]\n[[fi:Khand]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/regions/khand]]"}}}
