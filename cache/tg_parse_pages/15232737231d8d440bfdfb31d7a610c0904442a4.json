It lay on the tributary of the [[Brandywine]] known simply as [[the Water]], north of [[Whitfurrows]]. The town of Budgeford was the seat of the [[Bolger Family|Bolgers]], an important family among the [[Shire-hobbits]].<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe 'ford' in its name apparently derives from a ford across this stream. On the [[A Part of the Shire|Shire Map]] the name is written '''Budge Ford''', perhaps denoting especially the ford.\n\n''Budge-'' was an obscure [[Hobbitish]] element of no clear meaning in [[Westron]], believed to be connected to ''bulge'' and [[Bolgers]].<ref name=\"Nomen\">{{HM|N}}, p. 767</ref> Based on this, [[David Salo]] has suggested that the name represents a possible [[Old English|Old Hobbitish]] form *''Bolgraford'' \"Ford of the Bolgers\".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=https://tolkienlistsearch.herokuapp.com/message/5e9c35b63ee6a6c41e9862d6|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names (1.21)|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]|accessed=2022-09-23}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Budgeford.jpg|thumb|left|Budgeford in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Budgeford lies directly on the Water is a major farming community.\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Cities, towns and villages of the Shire]]\n\n[[de:Balgfurt]]\n[[fi:Bolgin kahlaamo]]"}}}
