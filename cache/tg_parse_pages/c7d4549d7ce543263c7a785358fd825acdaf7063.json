The song is played when Bilbo and company are seen floating in barrels down the river that leads to [[Lake-town]] in the [[1977]] [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|film adaptation]].  The music was composed by [[Maury Laws]] and the lyric was adapted by [[Jules Bass]] from the poem \"[[Roll-roll-roll-roll,]]\".\n\n==Lyrics==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nHeave ho! Splash plump!\nRollin' down the hole!\nHeave ho! Bang bump!\nRoll-roll-rollin' down the hole!\n\nDown the dark, swift stream you go\nBack to lands you once did know!\nWhere the forest wide and dim\nStoops in shadow grey and grim.\n\nHeave ho! Splash plump!\nRollin' down the hole!\nHeave ho! Bang bump!\nRoll-roll-rollin' down the hole!\n\nDown the dark, swift stream you go\nBack to lands you once did know!\nFloat beyond the world of trees\nOut into the whispering breeze.\n\nHeave ho! Splash plump!\nRollin' down the hole!\nHeave ho! Bang bump!\nRoll-roll-roll-roll-roll-roll\nRoll-roll-roll-roll-roll-rollin' down the hole!\n</poem>\n\n[[Category:The Hobbit (1977 film) soundtrack]]"}}}
