([[Quenya|Q.]] ˈ''The day has come!''ˈ) was the cry of [[Fingon]] during of the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad|Fifth Battle of Beleriand]], when he saw the armies of his brother [[Turgon]].\n\n==History==\nThe west wing of the [[Union of Maedhros]] was commanded by Fingon, who led the armies of [[House of Fingolfin|his house]] and the [[Edain]]. After the treason of the [[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterlings]] in the east wing, [[Maedhros]] didn't come from east [[Anfauglith]] as planned, and a dark cloud rose above both [[Thangorodrim]] and Fingon's heart. Unexpectedly, Turgon came forth, bringing ten thousand Elves from [[Gondolin]].\n\n{{blockquote|Then when Fingon heard afar the great trumpet of Turgon his brother, the shadow passed and his heart was uplifted, and he shouted aloud: '''''Utúlie'n aurë! Aiya Eldalië ar Atanatári, utúlie'n aurë! The day has come! Behold, people of the Eldar and Fathers of Men, the day has come!''''' And all those who heard his great voice echo in the hills answered crying: '''''Auta i lómë! The night is passing!'''''}}\n\nThe result of the following battle was tragic: Fingon died and Turgon only could run away after the Men of the [[House of Hador]] sacrificed themselves. However, the hope of the first battle cry was echoed by [[Húrin Thalion]] when he remained as the last standing fighter, shouting: ''[[Aurë entuluva!]] Day shall come again!''.<ref>{{S|20}}</ref>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://glaemscrafu.jrrvf.com/english/fingon.html Text, audio and translation] at [[Glǽmscrafu]]\n*[http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-190118387.html Analysis] at [[Eldamo]]\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Battle cries]]\n[[Category:Quenya texts]]"}}}
