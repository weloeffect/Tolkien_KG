It encompassed all areas once ruled by the Lochaw empire, at the southeast of the Mountains of the Wind.<ref name=\"ldrus\">{{EndorMap|LochasDrus}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n===Brôd===\n'''Brôd''' was a realm situated between the rivers Kirmóas (north), Runk (south), and Breacna (east). The Mountains of the Wind served as its western boundary. The Brôdim culture was a mix of local Braric traditions with Lochan and Wôlim influences. The Brôdim spoke the same language as the Wôlim, sharing a common social organization. Their political organization resembled that of the Lochaw. \n\nIts major urban centers were Sôgôl, Runk, and Brôd. Sôgôl, located on the south bank of the Kirmóas river, was a wealthy town that guarded the Wind Gates which was a pass through the mountains. Brôd was located more centrally, and while the least populated, it still served as the realm's political and religious center. Runk was named after the river and was situated near a waterfall. It guarded the sole bridge crossing the river. \n\nThe Braric symbol, the plain white orb, was displayed on Brôd's Lochan-inspired flag. It was set on a field diagonally divided into four. Each division represented a cardinal direction: the east was red, the south was green, the west was purple, and the north was blue.<ref name=\"brod\">{{EndorMap|Brod}}</ref>\n\n===Locha===\n'''Locha''' was the core of the Lochaw empire, located east of the river Breacna. Before being settled, it was inhabited by ''Lakhab'' (“Coast-folk”) and likely known as Cleeac.<ref name=\"locha\">{{EndorMap|Locha}}</ref>\n\n=== Wôl ===\nWôl was the most southern part of Lóchas Drûs. It was originally inhabited by the Wôlim, who spoke a tongue related to [[Drúadan language|Pûkael]].<ref name=\"wol\">{{EndorMap|Wol}}</ref> The Wôlim were described as war-like, often fighting against the Brôdan and neighbouring Ts'dan.<ref name=\"dwar\">{{ICE|8003}}, pp. 86-87</ref> They also settled [[Waw]] in the second and third centuries of the [[Second Age]].<ref name=\"waw\">{{EndorMap|Waw}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nChief Woma Dral of the Womaw tribe Surk sailed to Cleeac in South Eastern Middle-earth in {{SA|347}}. His Vuulmaw warriors immediately came into conflict with the local Lakhab, culminating in the ''Cunaaci-aac-Aalkbroda'' (\"Battle of Hillholds\"). This resulted in him being proclaimed the High Chief in {{SA|348}}, leading the first push towards centralization in the region, settling his Vuulmaw throughout the various parts of his new Lochas (“Never-ending Glen”).<ref name=\"locha\"/>\n\nAt some point before {{TA|1051}}, Waw had been conquered by the Lochaw, but it declared itself independent again in {{TA|1617}} after centuries of rebellion fomented by the [[Ringwraith]] [[Third of the Nazgûl|Dwar of Waw]].<ref name=\"dwar\"/>\n\nThe Lochaw empire was divided in {{TA|1794}}, leading to the rise of successor states that often followed previous cultural and political lines.<ref name=\"ldrus\"/>\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Middle-earth Role Playing locations]]"}}}
