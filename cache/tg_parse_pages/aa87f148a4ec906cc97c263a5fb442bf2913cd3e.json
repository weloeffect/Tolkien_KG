Bronwyn was invented for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'' by [[Amazon Studios]] and she is portrayed by [[Nazanin Boniadi]].<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9788618/fullcredits|articlename=Full Cast & Crew|dated=|website=IMDB|accessed=28 July 2022}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nBronwyn was born and grew up in the village of [[Hordern]], and at some point, she moved to [[Tirharad]], though her family remained behind. At some point later, she became the mother of [[Theo]] and she worked as an apothecary at Tirharad. During this time, she fell in love with the Silvan Elf [[Arondir]], though they kept their affection secret because of the negative sentiment of her race towards the Elves.\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Men from adaptations]]\n[[fi:Bronwyn (televisiosarjan hahmo)]]\n[[de: Bronwyn]]"}}}
