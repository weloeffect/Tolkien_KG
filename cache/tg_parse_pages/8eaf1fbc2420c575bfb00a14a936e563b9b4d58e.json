The lordship included the hills of [[Emyn Arnen]], located within [[South Ithilien]], and served as the seat of the [[Prince of Ithilien]]<ref>{{App|A1iiS}}, p. 1360</ref>. The title honored Faramir’s heritage as a descendant of the [[House of Húrin]] and his new role as a [[Steward of Gondor]]’s eastern lands during the [[Fourth Age]].{{Fact}}\n\n==History==\n===Origins of the Emyn Arnen===\n\nThe [[Emyn Arnen]] were a range of hills in [[South Ithilien]], east of the [[Anduin]] and across [[Minas Tirith]]. These hills were historically the homeland of the [[House of Húrin]], the ruling house of the [[Steward of Gondor]]. Before the Stewards moved their residence to Minas Tirith during the [[Third Age]], Emyn Arnen was the administrative center for their governance.\n\nThe hills of Emyn Arnen fell into neglect during Gondor’s long struggle against [[Mordor]] and its servants. Ithilien became depopulated and dangerous due to the rising influence of [[Sauron]], but after the [[War of the Ring]], it was restored as a flourishing region under the leadership of Prince [[Faramir]].<ref>{{L|244}}</ref>\n\n===Role in the United Kingdom===\n\n[[Faramir]]'s lordship over Emyn Arnen allowed him to oversee the reconstruction and governance of [[Ithilien]]. Under his care, [[Ithilien]] was transformed into a region of peace and beauty, know as the [[Garden of Gondor]]. This role reinforced the bond between [[Gondor]] and [[Rohan]] through Faramir's and [[Éowyn]]'s marriage.<ref>{{RK|VI5}}</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Mannish titles]]\n\n[[fi:Emyn Arnenin ruhtinas]]"}}}
