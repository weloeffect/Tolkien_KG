The book was published by [[The Tolkien Society]] in [[2005]] under the auspices of the [[Peter Roe Memorial Fund]].\n\n==Summary==\n{{blockquote|The seven papers in this volume examine the nature of influence. Alison Milbank looks at the Anglo-Saxon origins of Tolkien's use of Gift Exchange; she then considers how Tolkien's presentation of these ideas in \"The Lord of the Rings\" compares with modern theory. Maggie Fernandes explores Tolkien's use of names in \"The Lord of the Rings\" and how the sources he used often influenced the development and nature of the characters he created. Michele Fry shows how Tolkien's work influenced the work of three women writers, Robin Hobb, J.K. Rowling and Robin McKinley. Colin Duriez focuses on the influence that C.S. Lewis and Tolkien had on each other's work. Paul Kerry uses historical techniques to look at the nature of the evidence for Tolkien's Catholicism in his fiction and shows us how difficult it is to prove the existence influence. Nataliya Oryshchuk explores aspects of Tolkien's influence on post-Soviet culture. Finally Jessica Yates turns to film and surveys fantasy films, which show the influence of Tolkien.}}\n\n{{peterroe}}\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Publications by the Tolkien Society]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]"}}}
