Tolkien]]]]\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Dimrill Dale.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Dimrill Dale'']]\n'''Dimrill Dale''' was a valley on the east side of the [[Misty Mountains]], beneath the [[Caradhras|Redhorn]], [[Celebdil|Silvertine]], and [[Fanuidhol|Cloudyhead]] peaks. It was at the eastern end of the [[Redhorn Pass]] and was bordered by the [[Dimrill Stair]]. Dimrill Dale was the source of the [[Celebrant|Silverlode]] river and at its southeast corner was [[Mirrormere]], a sacred lake to the [[Dwarves]] of [[Durin's Folk]].<ref>{{FR|II6}}, p. 334</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Years of the Trees]], [[Durin|Durin the Deathless]] wandered south to Dimrill Dale and founded the Kingdom of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] beneath the surrounding mountains. Thousands of years later, after Orcs had turned the Dwarven city into the \"Black Pit\" of [[Moria]], the climactic battle of the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]] was fought here. The [[Battle of Azanulbizar]], which occurred in {{TA|2799}},<ref>{{App|TA}}, p. 1088</ref> it ended as a defeat of the Orcs and their leader [[Azog]]. However, the Dwarves were unable to take back Moria because of the [[Durin's Bane|Balrog]] that still dwelt there.<ref name=\"Durin\">{{App|Durin}}, p. 1075</ref>\n\nThe [[Fellowship of the Ring]] briefly rested in Dimrill Dale after escaping from Moria, following the loss of [[Gandalf]].<ref>{{FR|II5}}, p. 331</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Dimrill'' means \"overshadowed rills\" referring to the rills that ran down the mountain-side.<ref>{{HM|N}}</ref>\n\n==Other names==\n{{Pronounce|Azanulbizar.mp3|Ardamir}}\nThe Dwarves named the valley '''[[Azanulbizar]]''' in [[Khuzdul]].<ref name=\"names\">{{FR|II3}}, p. 283</ref> This name was lent to the [[Battle of Azanulbizar|battle]] fought there.<ref name=\"Durin\"/>\n\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] explored various possibilities regarding the exact interpretation of the elements occurring in the name: it is either ''[[Azanul]]'' + ''[[bizar]]'' or ''[[Uzn|Azan]]+[[ûl]]+[[bizar]]'', though the whole was to somehow express \"Dimrill Dale\".  \nTolkien stated that \"the Common Speech form is an accurate translation: the valley of the dim (overshadowed) rills that ran down the mountainside\".<ref>[[Jared Lobdell]] (ed.), ''[[A Tolkien Compass]]'', p. 182</ref> In another point it is given as \"Vale of Dim Streams\" with three elements.<ref name=\"RS\">{{HM|RS}}, p. 466</ref>\n\nThe first interpretation says that ''azan'' \"shadows, dimnesses\", ''[[-ul]]'' genitive marker and ''bizar'' \"streams, rills\"; in this interpretation it means \"rills of shadows\", and the word \"dale\" is understood (the full name being ''[[duban]] Azanulbizar'').<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 269</ref> \nAccording to the second interpretation, ''bizar'' means \"dale\" and ''ul'' \"rill(s), streams\".<ref name=\"RS\"/>\n\n'''Nanduhirion''' was the [[Sindarin]] name for the valley;<ref name=\"names\"/><ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, pp. 35, 37, 42</ref> it contains the elements ''[[nan|nan(d)]]'' (\"vale\"), ''[[dû]]'' (\"dimness\"), ''[[sîr]]'' (\"stream\") and the ending ''[[-nd|-(i)on]]'' (\"region\" or \"land\").<ref name=PE17/>\n\n== Portrayal in adaptations ==\n'''2008: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Dimrill Dale.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Dimrill Dale in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n:Nanduhirion encompasses the entire area between [[Moria]] and [[Lothlorien]]. The dwarves of the [[Iron Hills]] Garrison have established a camp \"Mekhem-bizru\" outside the Great Gates, while the Elves deal with the outsiders in \"Echad Andestel\" outside Lothlorien proper. When Lothlorien was first added to the game, completion of Echad Andestel quests was required to build up reputation with the [[Galadhrim]], who would otherwise shoot and kill whoever tried to approach the forest. As the game expanded and Lothlorien became a travel hub for nearby regions, that requirement was removed.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Valleys]]\n[[Category:Moria]]\n\n[[de:Schattenbachtal]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/reliefs/montagnes de brume/azanulbizar]]\n[[fi:Hämypuron laakso]]"}}}
