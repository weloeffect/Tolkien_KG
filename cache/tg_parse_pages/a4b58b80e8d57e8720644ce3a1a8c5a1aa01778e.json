I am a man without imagination, what I see is what I sing. When I read, I have a mental picture of what is happening, and that's what I'm doing. I'm drawing exactly what I've read and imagined. I read the description of d'Artagnan or Gandalf, imagined them, and they are by no means Mikhail Sergeyevich Boyarsky or Ian McKellen, they are completely different people.|Denis Gordeev, [http://szfan2020.ru/article/2021/idealnoy-illyustracii-ne-sushchestvuet Interview].}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[:Category:Images by Denis Gordeev|Images by Denis Gordeev]]\n* [[:Category:Images of Denis Gordeev|Images of Denis Gordeev]]\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [http://szfan2020.ru/article/2021/idealnoy-illyustracii-ne-sushchestvuet Interview]\n{{IllustratorsHobbit}}{{IllustratorsLOTR}}{{IllustratorsSilmarillion}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gordeev, Dennis}}\n[[Category:Artists]]\n[[Category:People by name]]\n[[Category:Russian people]]"}}}
