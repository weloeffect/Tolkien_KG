He was shaggy and grey, and suitable for mountain riding but slower than the horses of the [[Rohirrim]].\n==History==\nWhen [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], and [[Gimli]] rode off to [[Hornburg]] with the [[Grey Company]], King [[Théoden]] lent Stybba to [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]].<ref>{{RK|V2}}</ref> Stybba carried Merry through the mountain passes from the [[Hornburg]] east and south to [[Dunharrow]] and thence northward to [[Edoras]].  \n\nStybba was too slow to accompany the mustered army of Rohan across the plains, and Théoden ordered Merry to stay at the Courts with Lady [[Éowyn]]. Thus Stybba was left behind but Merry did secretly complete the journey with a Rider named [[Dernhelm]] (who was in fact Éowyn in disguise).<ref>{{RK|V3}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Stybba'' is [[Old English]] for \"stubby\".<ref>{{HM|IE}}, \"Giving of Names\" - Other Names of Rohan, p. 219</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''1980: [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]:'''\n:Merry rides a small pony undoubtedly intended to be Stybba, though not named as such. This version is evidently able to keep pace with the horses of Rohan, as no objection is raised against Merry riding with them to Gondor.\n\n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''\n:Merry is indeed shown riding a small pony while traveling with the Rohirrim from Edoras to Dunharrow. Though this pony is not identified as Stybba, it is obviously a reference to Stybba. \n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Horses]]"}}}
