How strangely quiet the woods are now, how dreary and threatening since the Shadow of Mordor cast its pall across the land six hundred years ago. Only the Giant Spiders of the forest seem content as they lie in their shadowy lairs, alert for the slightest stir in their sticky, steely webs...\n\n== See also ==\n*''[[Halls of the Elven-king]]''\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:MERP]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
