He is said to have suffered from ''\"horror borealis\"'' - intolerance of all things Northern or Germanic, but nonetheless was a close friend of [[Alwin Arundel Lowdham|Lowdham]] whose chief interest lay in the [[Anglo-Saxon]] language and history.<ref>{{SD|2b}}</ref> Sometimes Lowdham refered to him with made-up titles based on his name ([[Greek]] ''phil-ippos'', \"horse-loving\"<ref>{{SD|2dn}}, p. 285, note 33</ref>), like \"Lover of Horses and Horseplay\" or \"Horsefriend of Macedon\".<ref>{{SD|66}}, p. 236; \"Night 67\", p. 246</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Nicholas Guildford|Guildford]] he regards any knowledge of his own language at any period before the [[wikipedia:Battle of Bosworth Field|Battle of Bosworth]] as a misdemeanour.<ref>{{SD|61}}</ref> \n\nDuring one of the meetings of the Notion Club, he recited the poem ''[[Imram]] (The Death of [[Saint Brendan]])'' before the other members. He said that it came to him, more or less complete, in his dream.<ref>{{SD|69}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1989]], Frankley published a volume of a collection of poems entitled ''[[Experiments in Pterodactylics]]''. Of which, the opening poem was a short poem that he read at the [[Notion Club]].<ref>{{SD|60}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n{{notionclub}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Frankley, Philip}}\n[[Category:Characters from the later Ages]]\n[[Category:English people (in-universe)]]\n[[Category:The Notion Club Papers]]"}}}
