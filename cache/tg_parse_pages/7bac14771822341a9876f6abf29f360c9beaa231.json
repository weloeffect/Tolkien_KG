It marks a change of tone and style between the delicate \"Victorian fairy\" elements of the earlier ''[[Lost Tales]]'', and the darker Nordic descriptions that characterised his later work.<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=https://www.silmarillionwritersguild.org/node/5977|author=Dawn Walls-Thumma|articlename=Tinfang Warble|dated=1 October 2022|website=Silmarillion Writers' Guild|accessed=23 February 2023}}</ref>\n\n==Quenta Noldorinwa==\n===Analysis===\nWritten in [[1930]], this is the second version of the text that would eventually become the published ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', after the Sketch of the Mythology included in the previous chapter, \"[[The Earliest 'Silmarillion']]\".\n\nThis version of the Silmarillion holds especially importance as it is the only 'complete' version of the [[legendarium]] that Tolkien ever completed to its end. Following on from the ''[[Sketch of the Mythology]]'', this version of the Silmarillion also moves towards the final form of the story in almost all general terms.\n\nHowever this version does differ significantly from the published ''[[Silmarillion]]''. Most notable is that it is only about a quarter of the length of the published novel. This is largely due to Tolkien's often used method of expanding while composing. The end of the narrative differs in some respects, many names were still to be changed, and a few other narrative elements are slightly different or much more compressed, but by this stage the general history of the first age is largely complete.\n\nSince it is the only version of the legendarium Tolkien ever completed, it also includes the last narratives of all of \"[[The Nauglafring]]\" and of \"[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]\" on which the published forms were based, albeit much changed in form in many cases.\n\nThe text cites as its in-universe source Eriol's [[Book of Lost Tales]], itself based on the [[Golden Book]] in [[Koromas]] (a city on [[Tol Eressëa]] which is here and elsewhere called [[Kortirion]], after the city in Valinor which in later versions would be simplified to [[Tirion]]). In earlier versions the Golden Book of Tavrobel was written by Eriol or a later author. However, here is no evidence that Tolkien consulted the manuscripts of ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' at any point in the process of writing the Quenta.\n\n===Synopsis===\nAlthough the text is one continuous narrative, Christopher Tolkien included the same division as in the Sketch to facilitate his commentary. These \"chapters\" do not include any title, so what it is included here is just a description.\n\n*[Prologue]: Of the Valar\n*'''§1''': Beginning of days and making of the [[Two Trees]].\n*'''§2''': [[Awakening of the Elves]] and [[Captivity of Melkor|captivity of Morgoth]].\n*'''§3''': The [[Elves]] in [[Valinor]].\n*'''§4''': [[Darkening of Valinor]].\n*'''§5''': [[Flight of the Noldor|Flight of the Gnomes]].\n*'''§6''': Creation of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]].\n*'''§7''': Relations of Elves and [[Men]].\n*'''§8''': [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath|First Battle]] and the rescue of [[Maidros]].\n*'''§9''': [[Siege of Angband]], the houses of Men, the [[Ruin of Beleriand|Ruin of Broseliand]], the [[Fall of Fingolfin]].\n*'''§10''': [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]].\n*'''§11''': [[Battle of Unnumbered Tears]], Morgoth curses [[Húrin]].\n*'''§12''': [[Túrin]]'s story till the death of [[Beleg]].\n*'''§13''': Túrin's story till his death and burial.\n*'''§14''': Death of [[Thingol]] and [[ruin of Doriath]].\n*'''§15''' (& '''§15 QII'''): Founding of [[Gondolin]].\n*'''§16''' (& '''§16 QII'''): [[Meglin]], [[Tuor]] and the [[Fall of Gondolin]].\n*'''§17''' (& '''§17 QII'''): Voyage of [[Eärendel]] to Valinor.\n*'''§18''' (& '''§18 QII'''): [[War of Wrath|Last Battle]] and defeat of Morgoth.\n*'''§19''': The expelling of Morgoth and the [[Second Prophecy of Mandos|Prophecy of Mandos]].\n\n==Appendices==\nChristopher included two Appendices within the chapter related to ''The Quenta''.\n===Appendix 1: Ælfwine's translation of the Quenta into Old English===\nIncluded in this appendix are surviving fragments of Anglo-Saxon translations of the ''[[The Earliest Annals of Valinor|Annals of Valinor]]'', the ''[[The Earliest Annals of Beleriand|Annals of Beleriand]]'', and ''Quenta Noldorinwa'', as well as the [[Old English]] equivalents of various Elvish names. All of this is attributed in-universe to [[Ælfwine]].\n\nThe [[Valar]] as a whole are called the ''Fréan'' (singular ''Fréa'', meaning \"ruler\" or \"lord\"), ''Ese'' (singular ''Os'', meaning \"god\"), ''Brega'' (singular ''Bregu'', \"ruler\" or \"lord\"), or ''Mægnu'' (singular ''Mægen'', \"power\" or \"might\"). ''Mægen'' appears in the Old English translation of the Quenta included in this chapter.\n\n*[[Manwë]] is ''Wolcenfréa'' (from ''wolcen'', meaning \"sky\").\n*[[Melkor]] (here called Melko) is ''Manfréa'' (''man'', meaning \"evil\" or \"wickedness\"), ''Bolgen'' (meaning \"wrathful\"), and Malscor (related to ''malscrung'', \"bewildering\" or \"bewitching\").\n*[[Ulmo]] becomes ''Garsecges fréa'' (''Garsecg'', a name for the Sea), ''ealwæter-fréa'' (''eal'' \"all\" + ''wæter'' \"water\"), and ''agendfréa ealra wætera'' (which adds the term ''agend'', \"owner\"). This last name for Ulmo comes from the Old English translation of the Quenta that appears in this appendix.\n*[[Aulë]] is ''Cræftfréa'' (''cræft'', \"power\" or \"art\").\n*Tulkas is ''Afodfréa'' (''afod'' or ''eafod'' \"might, strength\").\n*[[Oromë]] is ''Wáðfréa'' (''wáð'' \"hunting\"), ''Huntena fréa'' (''huntena'' \"of hunters\"), ''Wealdafréa'' (''wealda'' \"of forests\"), which is a translation of Oromë's [[Noldorin]] epithet ''Tauros'' (which would be replaced by ''Tauron'' in later versions of the legendarium) that appears in the Old English Quenta, and ''Béaming'' (''béam'' \"tree\"), which is a translation of his Quenya epithet ''Aldaron''.\n*The [[Fëanturi]], [[Námo]] and [[Irmo]], are called Nefréa (''ne(o)'' \"corpse\") and Swefnfréa (''swefn'' \"dream\") -- in the ''Old English Quenta'', Námo is also called ''neoaerna hlaford'' (\"master of the houses of the dead\").\n*[[Ossë]] is listed among the VAlar as well, and given the name ''Sǽfréa'' (''sǽ'' \"sea\").\n\n===Appendix 2: The Horns of Ylmir===\nSong of [[Tuor]] mentioned within ''The Quenta''.\n\n{{main|The Horns of Ylmir}}\n{{references}}\n[[fi:The Quenta]]"}}}
