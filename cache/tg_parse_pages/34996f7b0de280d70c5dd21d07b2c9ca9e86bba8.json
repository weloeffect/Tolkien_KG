Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', \"Index; *Gamil Zirak\"</ref>\n\n== History ==\nGamil Zirak was a Dwarf smith, master of Telchar of Nogrod, maker of many renowned works. Gamil Zirak was a great craftsman himself, and the treasuries of [[Thingol]] were known to hold examples of his work.<ref>{{UT|Narn}}, ''The Departure of Túrin''</ref>\n\nEven though it isn't explicitly stated in the text, the fact that Gamil Zirak was the master of Telchar of Nogrod makes it probable that he also lived in that city.\n\nWhether he lived in Nogrod or its neighboring city [[Belegost]], it's probable that Gamil Zirak was one of the [[Firebeards]] or [[Broadbeams]], the two dwarven houses that settled in the [[Blue Mountains]].<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', Part Two: Late Writings, X. \"[[Of Dwarves and Men]]\"</ref> It's also probable that, besides [[Khuzdul]], he spoke [[Sindarin]], for that was the custom among the Dwarves.<ref>[[J.R.R.
