It is the longest known sample of both [[Sindarin]] prose and [[Tengwar]].\n\n==Position in the story==\nThe omitted epilogue was finally published in ''[[Sauron Defeated]]'', and tells the story of [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] and his children in the year 16 of the [[Fourth Age]].<ref>{{SD|XI}}</ref> At this time, only eight of Sam's thirteen children are born, [[Daisy Gardner|Daisy]] being the youngest.\n\nOne night, Sam gathers his children around the fire to tell them of a letter he received, from King Elessar far away. It was black, the letters were golden, and it was wrapped in silk. In the letter, Elessar greets Samwise and his children, and tells them he will ride to the [[Fornost Erain|North]]. He would meet all those interested on the [[Brandywine Bridge|Bridge of Baranduin]]. He would not enter [[the Shire]], as he himself banned Men from entering the Hobbits' land.\n\n==Versions==\nThree versions of the actual letter exist. The first and third were published with the epilogue in ''Sauron Defeated''. The second version was first published as the cover image of [[Vinyar Tengwar 29]], and later reproduced as image 199 in ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator]]''.\n\n===First version===\nThe first version is written in a vowel-mode which employs tengwar for vowels, like the [[Mode of Beleriand]]. The text goes:\n{|\n|-\n|Aragorn Strider The Elfstone, King of Gondor and Lord of the Westlands, will approach the Bridge of Baranduin on the eighth day of Spring, or in the Shire-reckoning the second day of April. And he desires to greet there all his friends. ''In especial'' he desires to see Master ''Samwise'', Mayor of the Shire, and ''Rose'' his wife; and ''Elanor'', ''Rose'', ''Goldilocks'', and ''Daisy'' his daughters; and ''Frodo'', ''Merry'', ''Pippin'' and ''Hamfast'' his sons.<br>\n:To Samwise and Rose the King's greeting from Minas Tirith, the thirty-first day of the Stirring, being the twenty-third of February in their reckoning.<br><center>A•E•</center>\n|Elessar Telcontar: Aragorn Arathornion Edhelharn, aran Gondor ar Hîr i Mbair Annui, anglennatha i Varanduiniant erin dolothen Ethuil, egor ben genediad Drannail erin Gwirith edwen. Ar e aníra ennas suilannad mhellyn în phain: ''edregol'' e aníra tírad i Cherdir ''Perhael'' (i sennui ''Panthael'' estathar aen) Condir i Drann, ar ''Meril'' bess dîn, ar ''Elanor'', ''Meril'', ''Glorfinniel'', ar ''Eirien'' sellath dîn; ar ''Iorhael'', ''Gelir'', ''Cordof'', ar ''Baravorn'', ionnath dîn. <br>\n:A ''Pherhael'' ar am ''Meril'' suilad uin aran o Minas Tirith nelchaenen uin Echuir.<center>A•E•</center>\n|}\n\nThe translation misses one line: ''(i sennui ''Panthael'' estathar aen)''. This translates as \"who ought to be called ''Fullwise''\", referring to Samwise's name, meaning \"Halfwise\".\n\n===Second version===\nThis second version polishes up some minor mistakes and corrections in the first, but omits the date and place of the letter, and ''ar Arnor'' is added after the first ''Gondor''. It is also written in the vowel mode.\n\n===Third version===\nThis version, included in a second sketch of the epilogue, uses vowel-[[tehtar]] instead of the vowel-tengwar of the previous mode. The text is slightly different from the second version. The word order of the first sentence is changed, and in the postscript, the year is added: 1436 of the [[Shire Reckoning]] in the English version, and 16 in the [[Stewards' Reckoning]]. The signature, which could not consist of two vowels in this mode, is written ''Ar•El•''\n\n==Significance==\n===Tengwar===\nThese texts are the longest known examples of Sindarin Tengwar, and added several symbols to the alphabet. Commas, colons, brackets and periods were previously unknown, and the third letter contained information on numerals.\n\nThe letter also provided the correct tengwar for diphthongs. These are as follows:\n*'''AE''': written as {{tg|mode=smith|lD}} ''[[yanta]]'' + /a/-[[tehtar|tehta]]\n*'''AI''': written as {{tg|mode=smith|hD}} ''[[anna]]'' + /a/-tehta\n*'''EI''': written as {{tg|mode=smith|hF}} ''[[anna]]'' + /e/-tehta\n*'''IE''': written as {{tg|mode=smith|1B}} /i/-short carrier amd the /e/ on top of the following consonant\n*'''UI''': written as {{tg|mode=smith|hJ}} ''[[anna]]'' + u-tehta\n\nThough numerals were already published in ''[[Quettar]]'' ([[1982#February|1982]]), the letter employs a quite different shape for the characters.<ref>Reconstructed and analyzed [http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/md_kl_num.html here] by [[Per Lindberg]]</ref> We also see \nthe order of the numerals - right to left. So 1436 and 16 appear as [6341] and [61] here.\n\n===Sindarin===\nThese texts show the use of various formations unknown prior to publication, such as the use of the gerund after another verb, word order, passive sentences, and various names.\n\nThe following Sindarin names appear in the versions of this letter:\n*Aragorn\n*Arathornion, \"Arathornsson\"\n*Edhelharn, \"Elessar, Elfstone\"\n*Perhael, \"Samwise\", though this had already appeared in the [[Minstrel of Gondor|minstrel of Gondor's]] [[Frodo of the Nine Fingers|lay]] in the chapter ''[[The Field of Cormallen]].''\n*Panthael, \"Fullwise\"\n*Meril, \"Rose\". This name was used in early writings for the lady of [[Tol Eressëa]], [[Meril-i-Turinqi]].\n*Glorfinniel, \"Goldilocks\"\n*Eirien, \"Daisy\", reminiscient of ''[[Arien]]''.\n*Iorhael, \"Frodo\". In the Ringbearer's praise, [[Frodo Baggins]] was called ''Taur'' (lenited ''Daur'') instead.\n*Gelir, \"Merry\"\n*Cordof, \"Pippin\"\n*Baravorn, \"Hamfast\"\n*i Drann, \"The Shire\"\n*i Varanduiniant, \"Brandywine Bridge\"\n\n==Calendar==\nThe dating system of the letter is not described in the Appendices but can be found in the ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]''. It is a system where \"dates were usually given in official documents by the Seasons, but the old month-names ... remained in private and popular use.\"\n\nThe \"thirty-first day of Stirring\" (echuir) of 16 N.R. represents [[23 February]] of {{SR|1436}}; the \"eighth day of Spring\" (ethuil) 17 N.R. represents [[2 April]] {{SR|1436}}.\n\n1 N.R. = {{SR|1420}} = {{TA|3020}} (not {{TA|3021}} as [[Christopher Tolkien]] suggests in a footnote).\n\nNote that this corresponds to the abandoned calendaric system displayed in ''The Peoples of Middle-earth'' which was abandoned and contradicts that of the Appendices where 31 echuir should represent [[24 February]].<ref>[[Andreas Moehn]] [http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Time.html The Reckoning of Time]</ref>\n\n==External links==\n*{{SD|Epilogue}}\n*[[Wayne G.
