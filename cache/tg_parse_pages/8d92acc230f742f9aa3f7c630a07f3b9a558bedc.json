He advised him to adopt the name \"[[Mr. Underhill]]\" when outside [[the Shire]].<ref>{{FR|Shadow}}</ref> \n\nIt was [[Mid-year's Day]] and on his way he heard disturbing news from [[Radagast]], that [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] were sent from [[Sauron]] to seek the Shire.<ref name=council>{{FR|Council}}</ref> He came hastily to the [[the Prancing Pony|''Prancing Pony'']] and wrote a warning letter to Frodo.<ref name=Strider/> Gandalf then departed for [[Isengard]] to seek advice from [[Saruman]].<ref name=council/>\n\n==Content==\nIn the letter, written in his \"strong but graceful script\", Gandalf warned Frodo that he might not return when promised and that Frodo should leave as soon as possible, preferably before [[August]]; whenever Gandalf would be available, he would come to the Shire and try to catch up with them. If Frodo ever came to [[Bree]] he should trust [[Barliman Butterbur]] and leave a message for Gandalf. He also mentioned that Frodo might meet a [[Men|Man]] in the area named [[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]] (whom Gandalf had already met and informed on [[May 1]]) who could assist him. \n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - G for Gandalf.png|right|50px]]\nHe concluded the letter with 3 warnings: that he should not wear the Ring again, and avoid traveling during night; he included [[Riddle of Strider|a rhyme]] which would prove Strider's real identity, which is [[Aragorn]]; and finally, he mentioned his worries that the forgetful Barliman might not send this letter in time. The letter was signed with the [[cirth|certh]] \"G\" for Gandalf.<ref name=Strider/>\n\n==Afterwards==\nBefore leaving Bree, Gandalf instructed Barliman to send this letter to Hobbiton as soon as possible. He also told him to expect a \"Mr. Underhill\", whose real name was Baggins, giving Frodo's detailed description. However Gandalf's worries proved to be correct: He was captured in [[Orthanc]] and therefore could not reach Frodo on their assigned date.<ref name=council/> Furthermore, Barliman could not find someone who would travel to Hobbiton, and day after day, this obligation was forgotten.<ref name=Strider/>\n\nFrodo never received the letter and kept on waiting for Gandalf in Hobbiton.<ref>{{FR|I3}}</ref> Having no sign from the Wizard, he departed on [[September 23]],<ref name=great/> much later than Gandalf would have instructed him. Meanwhile Gandalf had escaped Orthanc and rode [[Shadowfax]] to the Shire, less than a week after Frodo's departure.<ref name=great>{{App|Great}}</ref>\n\nIt was not until \"Mr. Underhill\" came to the ''Prancing Pony'' with [[travellers|a company of 3 hobbits]] when Butterbur made the connection. Strider happened also to be there and both he and the hobbits tried to discern each other's trustfullness. Butterbur arrived with the letter which proved to Frodo that Strider was Gandalf's friend, and Strider realized that Frodo was the halfling Gandalf told him about. However all were worried in absence of news from the Wizard.<ref name=Strider/>\n\nThe hobbits resumed their travel to Rivendell with Strider the next morning,<ref>{{FR|Knife}}</ref> without knowing that Gandalf would arrive to Bree that same night.<ref name=great/>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Books and documents within the legendarium]]"}}}
