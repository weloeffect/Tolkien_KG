The great region is located south of [[Harondor]] and [[Mordor]]. Very little is known of the [[Dark Land|southern lands]] beyond the great [[Sea of Ringil]].\n\n==History==\n===Before the First Age===\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Lamp of the Valar.jpg|thumb|left|\"Ormal, The Lamp of the Valar\" by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]In the [[Days before days|primordial times]] of [[Arda]], the southern land of Middle-earth was illuminated by one of the [[Two Lamps|two mighty lamps]], named [[Ormal]], atop a mighty pillar. Ormal was made by [[Aulë]], filled by [[Varda]] and hallowed by [[Manwë]] in the south of the world while the [[Valar]] still dwelt on [[Almaren]]. Both lamps were eventually destroyed by an assault by [[Morgoth|Melkor]],<ref name=\"Rend\">{{S|Days}}</ref> and the destruction of Ormal created the southern Sea of Ringil.<ref>{{SM|5b}}</ref><ref>{{SM|5e}}</ref>\n\nDuring the period in which Melkor bred monsters of diverse shapes and kinds that troubled [[Endor]], his realm spread from [[Utumno]] over the southern lands of Middle-earth.<ref>{{S|3}}, p. 54</ref>\n\n===First Age===\nSome of the first [[Men]] leaving [[Rhûn]], after the [[Awakening of Men|awakening]] in [[Hildórien]], eventually settled in Harad and became the ancestors of the [[Haradrim]].<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}, p. 306</ref><ref>{{S|12}}</ref> Historians of [[Gondor]] believed that the [[Drúedain]] came from lands south of [[Mordor]], that they turned north into [[Ithilien]] before they reached the coasts of Harad and were the first Men to cross the [[Anduin]].<ref>{{UT|12b}}, pp. 339-40</ref>\n\nThe coast south of Harad extended much farther west before the ruin of Beleriand.<ref>{{NM|P1vii}}, entry VY 1130/95, p. 52</ref>\n\n===Second Age===\nWhen the Men of [[Númenor]] began sailing east they explored the coasts of [[Middle-earth]], including the coast lands of Harad. The Númenóreans initially benefited the people in the lands they explored by teaching them many things about agriculture and craftsmanship.<ref name=\"Akallabeth\">{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref><ref>{{App|Numenor}}, entry for the time after Minastir</ref> The Númenóreans later made settlements on the southern coasts, including the Havens of [[Umbar]].\n\nIn the 9th century of the Second Age, the great mariner [[Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion]] sailed to the haven of [[Lond Daer|Vinyalondë]] and then sailed along the coasts southwards, far beyond any place yet reached by the Númenóreans. On his return northwards he barely escaped being shipwrecked in the Harad.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}</ref> \n\nAfter the reign of [[Tar-Ciryatan]], the Númenóreans began to set themselves up as lords in Middle-earth as they demanded tribute of goods and wealth, causing the oppression of the Haradrim. The Númenóreans expanded their control over Harad and Sauron did not at first dare to challenge them. But after the forging of the [[Rings of Power]] and the emergence of the [[Nazgûl]], Sauron began to attack the Númenórean settlements on the coast.<ref name=\"Akallabeth\" />\n\nAfter the forging of the Rings of Power almost all men east and south of the [[Ered Luin]] were under [[Sauron|Sauron's]] rule. Sauron was both their king and their god. These men grew strong and built many towns and walls made from stone and they were fierce in war and armed with iron.<ref name=\"Rings\">{{S|Rings}}</ref>\n\nUmbar was fortified in {{SA|2280|n}}.<ref name=\"SA\">{{App|SA}}</ref>\n\n[[Ar-Pharazôn]], the king of Númenor, landed at [[Umbar]] in {{SA|3261|n}}<ref name=\"SA\" /> with a great fleet and the people on the coasts fled before them. Ar-Pharazôn and his host marched through Harad to meet Sauron's forces, but they fled from the Númenóreans and Sauron allowed himself to be taken to Númenor where he corrupted the King and his followers. Under Sauron's influence, the Númenóreans became even more ruthless to the locals of Harad, enslaving them and using them for sacrifices.<ref name=\"Akallabeth\" />\n\nDuring the stay of Sauron in Númenor many of the Númenóreans who sailed east from Númenor and made fortresses and dwellings upon the coasts of the southlands in Middle-earth were already bent to his will.<ref name=\"Rings\" />\n\nThe Númenóreans who lived in Harad survived the [[Downfall of Númenor|drowning]] of Númenor in {{SA|3319|n}}. They were later called [[Black Númenóreans]] in Gondor,<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Eärnil I, footnote 1</ref><ref>{{RK|Gate}}</ref> because they still served Sauron in Middle-earth after the drowning of Númenor. They fought with Sauron during the [[War of the Last Alliance]] against the Alliance of Elves and Men. Two of those númenórean lords, [[Herumor]] and [[Fuinur]] rose to power among the Haradrim.<ref name=\"Rings\" />\n\n===Third Age and later history===\n[[File:Lída Holubová - Harad.jpg|thumb|''Harad'' by [[Lída Holubová]]]]\nThe settlements of the Númenóreans beyond Umbar had been absorbed or had become hostile to Gondor and parts of Sauron's dominions because they were made by men that were already corrupted by Sauron in Númenor.<ref>{{UT|Istari}}</ref>\n\nKing [[Eärnil I]] of Gondor laid siege by sea and land to Umbar and in {{TA|933|n}}<ref name=\"APTA\">{{App|TA}}</ref> conquered Umbar, which became a great fortress of Gondor. Three years later in {{TA|936|n}}<ref name=\"APTA\" /> Eärnil I was lost with many ships and men in a storm near Umbar.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Eärnil I</ref>\n\nThe Men of the Harad, led by the lords that had been driven from Umbar, came with great power against Umbar and laid siege to it. King [[Ciryandil]] fell in the siege of Umbar in {{TA|1015|n}}.<ref name=\"APTA\" /><ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Ciryandil</ref>\n\nUmbar was under a siege for many years, but could not be taken because of the sea-power of Gondor. King [[Ciryaher]] of Gondor came from the north by sea and by land and crossed the river Harnen. His armies defeated the Men of the Harad and the kings of Harad were forced to acknowledge the overlordship of Gondor in {{TA|1050|n}}.<ref name=\"APTA\" /><ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Ciryaher</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Kin-strife]], [[Castamir]]'s sons with others of their kin and with many people of the fleets sailed away from [[Pelargir]] and seized Umbar in {{TA|1448|n}}.<ref name=\"APTA\" /> They made a refuge for all enemies of King [[Eldacar]] and a Lordship independent of Gondor at Umbar. Umbar remained at war with Gondor for many lives of men and was a threat to the coastlands of Gondor and to all traffic on the sea. After Gondor lost Umbar to the rebels, Gondor's control over the Men of the Harad was loosened.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Eldacar</ref>\n\nKing [[Telumehtar Umbardacil|Telumehtar]] of Gondor conquered Umbar in {{TA|1810|n}}. During that war the last descendants of Castamir perished and Umbar was again held for a while by the kings of Gondor.<ref name=\"APTA\" /><ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Telumehtar</ref>\n\nAfter the [[War of the Ring]] the newly crowned king of the [[Reunited Kingdom]], [[Aragorn|Elessar]], made peace with the Men of Harad<ref>{{RK|VI5}}</ref> and completely subdued Umbar.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Elessar</ref><ref name=\"Éomer\">{{App|Mark}}, Third Line, entry for King Éomer</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nHarad was located south of Mordor, with the [[Ephel Dúath|Mountains of Shadow]] forming part of the northern border of Harad. The River Harnen flowed westward from the Mountains of Shadow to the [[Bay of Belfalas]] and was Harad's border with South Gondor - a deserted region contested between [[Gondor]] and Harad. The Harad Road ran from Harad northward through South Gondor and on to [[Ithilien]].\n\nTo the north-east of Harad was [[Khand]], a land that also had ties with Sauron. It is not known how far eastward or southward Harad stretched. On the west, Harad was bounded by the Bay of [[Belfalas]] and the [[Belegaer|Sea]].\n\nThe northernmost part of Harad was called [[Near Harad]] and the southern part was [[Far Harad]]. On the coast there was a natural harbour with a narrow cape curving around it. The coastal region around the harbour was known as Umbar, and the harbour was called the Havens of Umbar. The seafaring raiders known as the [[Corsairs of Umbar|Corsairs]] lived there. At the eastern end of the harbour was the City of the Corsairs.<ref>{{FR|Map}}</ref> Somewhere in Harad was the inland city that [[Berúthiel]] came from.<ref name=\"Interview\">{{webcite|author=[[Daphne Castell]]|articleurl=https://fantasticmetropolis.com/i/tolkien|articlename=The Realms of Tolkien|dated=|website=[https://fantasticmetropolis.com/i/tolkien ''The Realms of Tolkien'']|accessed=15 January 2021}}.</ref>\n\nThere were fortresses and dwellings upon the coasts in the south.<ref name=\"Rings\" /> There were also fields<ref name=\"Éomer\" /> and \"dark forests\" with [[apes]] in the south.<ref>{{TT|Deep}}</ref> In Harad lived also [[camels]] and the gigantic [[Oliphaunts]],<ref>''[[A Map of Middle-earth]]''</ref><ref name=\"Gate\">{{TT|IV3}}</ref> which were used by the Haradrim as moving war towers.\n\nHarad was called the \"[[Sunlands]]\" by the [[Hobbits]] of [[the Shire]],<ref name=\"Gate\" /> suggesting the climate was warmer and sunnier.

There were many tribes of the Haradrim often mutually hostile. The men of [[Near Harad]] were brown-skinned, with black hair and dark eyes,<ref name=\"Gate\" /> while the men of [[Far Harad]] were described as black-skinned with white eyes and red tongues like \"[[half-trolls]]\".<ref>{{RK|Battle}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Harad'' means \"South\" in [[Sindarin]].<ref>{{App|E1i}}</ref> The word is derived from [[Sundocarme|root]] [[KHYAR]], and is cognate to [[Quenya]] ''[[hyarmen]]'' (\"south\").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry \"KHYAR\"</ref> It is also called [[Haradwaith]] which includes ''[[gwaith]]'' (\"people\").

After the building of [[Wingilot]], Eärendel searches for [[Elwing]] and is blown far to the South where he encounters [[Wirilómë]] before escaping eastward.<ref>{{LT2|V}}, pp. 260</ref> In his voyage wih [[Voronwe]] on Wingilot to the south dark regions and fire mountains are mentioned.<ref>{{LT2|V}}</ref><ref group=\"note\">The habited land in question featuring \"Dark regions, Fire mountains, Tree-men, Pygmies, and Sarqindi or cannibal-ogres\" is probably to the south of Haradwaith rather than the [[Dark Lands]], due to another note mentioning some southern Isles beyond that region, and these can only be the hills that became islands mentioning in ''[[The Chaining of Melko]]'', which must have been a product of the tumults that lead to the formation of the [[Inner Seas]], when the [[Belegaer]] and [[Eastern Sea]] flowed into the [[Sea of Ringil]]. And as we know, it was South of the Inner Seas that the South Lands were located. Ergo, Eärendil simply visited areas that would later be part of the [[Black Númenórean]] southern realms, beyond the realm of [[Umbar]]. J.R.R. Tolkien mentioned that Africa lies south of Harad in an interview and also wrote that the coast south of Haradwaith extended much farther west before the ruin of Beleriand.</ref> Additionally, In 1930, Tolkien wrote how Eärendil fought and slew [[Ungoliant]] in the South, which resulted in light coming to many places which had yet long been hid.<ref>{{SM|Quenta}}</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nIn an interview from 1967, when asked what lay south of Harad, Tolkien replied \"And south of Harad is Africa, the hot countries.\"<ref>{{webcite|author=Henry Resnick|articleurl=https://efanzines.com/Niekas/Niekas-18.pdf|articlename=An Interview with Tolkien|dated=2 March 1966|website=Niekas Volume 18 (archived on eFanzines.com)|accessed=7 October 2021}}, p. 41</ref> Given the descriptions of the inhabitants of Middle-earth's southern lands,<ref name=\"Gate\">{{TT|IV3}}</ref> the early etymologies of their name,<ref name=\"Fangorn\" /> and the overall shape of the southern lands as shown in the [[Ambarkanta maps]],<ref>{{SM|Ambar}}, pp. 250-1</ref> it is likely that Harad may have been based on the lands of [[Wikipedia:North Africa|northern]] and [[Wikipedia:Northeast Africa|northeastern Africa]] and perhaps the [[Wikipedia:Middle East|Middle East]] in our world. In addition, apart from the peninsula and firth of Umbar, the shape of the coastline of Harad south of the mouth of the river Harnen on the [[General Map of Middle-earth]] is similar to the shape of the coastline of the northwestern coast of Africa south of the city of [[Wikipedia:Tangier|Tangier]].\n\n{{references|note}}\n[[Category:Regions]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[Category:Sindarin nouns]]\n[[Category:Southern lands]]\n[[de:Harad]]\n[[fi:Harad]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/regions/harad]]"}}}
