It was where [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] called home through most of his childhood from [[1895]]-[[1911]]. Tolkien's parents [[Arthur Tolkien|Arthur]] and [[Mabel Suffield|Mabel]] came from this city.<ref>{{CG|RG}}, pp. 115-8</ref> Tolkien's experience of growing up and living in Birmingham had a huge impression on him and his life's work.<ref name=Council>Birmingham City Council, [http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/tolkien J. R. R. Tolkien] (accessed 19 March 2011)</ref>\n\n==Tolkien's childhood in Birmingham==\nTolkien was born in the [[Orange Free State]] in 1892. However in 1895 [[J.R.R. Tolkien|John]], his brother [[Hilary Tolkien|Hilary]] and his mother [[Mabel Tolkien]] moved into a cottage in Sarehole, a village four miles from the centre of Birmingham. The green woods and fields of his new home had a huge affect on a Tolkien who had only ever known the hot and dry conditions of South Africa. Indeed Tolkien modelled his descriptions of [[The Shire]] on his memories of Sarehole. [[Sarehole Mill]] is quite possibly the [[Old Mill]] of [[Hobbiton]].<ref name=Council/>\n\nTolkien joined [[King Edward's School]] in September [[1900]]. Over the next few years the family moved several times: first to Moseley in 1900; then to Westfield Road, King's Heath in March [[1901]]; and finally to Oliver Road, Edgbaston in [[1902]]. Following Mabel's conversion to Catholicism her family withdrew financial support prompting her to pull Tolkien out of King Edward's School. He and his brother were enrolled in the Oratory School, St Philips. Tolkien returned to King Edward's School in [[1903]] after winning a scholarship from the school. Before Mabel died in [[1904]] from diabetes, she appointed [[Francis Xavier Morgan|Father Francis Xavier Morgan]] to be John and [[Hilary Tolkien|Hilary's]] guardian.<ref name=Council/>\n\nIn [[September]] [[1933]] Tolkien visited his childhood sceneries in Sarehole, and was disappointed that it had \"been exposed to such violent and peculiarly hideous change\"; Hall Green had become a suburb, new buildings with red brick surrounded their old cottage, a bluebell lane traversed by motors, the miller's house converted to a petrol station, and many trees gone.<ref>{{HM|Bio}}, pp. 124-5</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{WP|Birmingham}}\n*[http://libraryofbirmingham.com/tolkien Library of Birmingham]\n*[http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/cs/Satellite?c=Page&childpagename=Lib-Central-Archives-and-Heritage/PageLayout&cid=1223187284543&pagename=BCC/Common/Wrapper/Wrapper J.R.R.Tolkien's childhood in Birmingham] at [http://www.birmingham.gov.uk/ Birmingham City Council]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fj7CiCc0dno Tolkien's Birmingham 1 - Early Years - Youtube video]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmrAmuQELUk Tolkien's Birmingham 2 - Local Landmarks- Youtube video]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJh9M9gjxwc Tolkien's Birmingham 3 - Kinver Edge Rock Houses - Youtube video]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MUZiXgpLus Tolkien's Birmingham 4 - Middle Earth Weekend - Youtube video]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiuICx_xnpE Tolkien's Birmingham 5 - Vivienne Wilkes - Youtube video]\n\n[[Category:British locations]]\n[[Category:Cities (real-world)]]\n \n[[de:Birmingham]]\n[[fi:Birmingham]]"}}}
