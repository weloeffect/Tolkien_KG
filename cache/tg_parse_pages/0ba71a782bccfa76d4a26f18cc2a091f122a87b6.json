He witnessed the meeting of [[Mrs. Bunce]] with the [[Lonely Troll]] and he was in turn frightened. When he learned that the Troll was kind and generous, he and other [[Hobbits]] tried to visit him. But the Troll refused those who had refused his friendship.<ref name=\"Perry\"/>\n\nIt is unknown if this character was based on an actual person, or just an invention by the poet.<ref name=\"Perry\">{{AB|Perry}}</ref>\n \n{{references}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]\n[[Category:Hobbits]]\n[[Category:Mayors of Michel Delving]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[fi:Potti]]"}}}
