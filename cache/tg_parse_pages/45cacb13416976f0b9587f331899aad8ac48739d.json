A. Wyn|Aaron A. Wyn]] in [[1952]]. Ace Books published fantasy and science fiction books that were edited by [[Donald A. Wollheim]]. Ace Books published an unauthorized edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n==History==\nIn [[1965]], Ace Books discovered a copyright loophole regarding the American edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. The [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition had been bound using pages printed in the United Kingdom for the [[Allen & Unwin|George Allen & Unwin]] edition. This placed them outside of U.S. copyright law as it stood at the time. Exploiting this loophole, Ace Books published the first-ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, for only $0.75,<ref name=\"rc\">{{HM|RC}}, p. 40</ref> featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by [[Jack Gaughan]].<ref>{{Webcite|articleurl=https://www.tolkienbookshelf.com/pages/books/2630/j-r-r-tolkien/the-lord-of-the-rings-ace-pirated-edition-from-1965-in-custom-leather-slipcase|articlename=THE LORD OF THE RINGS, ACE PIRATED EDITION FROM 1965, IN CUSTOM LEATHER SLIPCASE|website=https://www.tolkienbookshelf.com/|accessed=27 January 2024}}</ref> This proved to be a commercial success and over 100,000 copies of the book were sold.<ref>{{webcite|author=Andrew Liptak|articleurl=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/news-and-features/articles/unauthorized-lord-rings/|articlename=The Unauthorized Lord of the Rings|dated=5 December 2013|website=[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/ Kirkus Reviews]|accessed=19 March 2024}}</ref>\n\nWhen Tolkien and his publisher learned about this he was asked to make revisions in order to renew the copyright; which he agreed to despite being originally against the idea of a paperback.<ref>{{webcite|author=Margaret Wood|articleurl=https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2014/11/j-r-r-tolkien-paperbacks-and-copyright/|articlename=J.R.R.

Scott, to whom he expressed gratitude in [[Letter 273|a letter]], citing the situation as a major source of stress for him.<ref>{{L|273}}</ref> In a letter to his grandson [[Michael George Tolkien]] he reported that his campaign against Ace Books had been largely successful and he believed the attention may lead to more (authorized) books being sold in America than if Ace Books hadn't pirated it.<ref>{{L|279}}</ref> \n\nThe legal loophole that had been exploited meant that, despite the new edition, the original edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' was still in the public domain in America with Tolkien having no copyright claim to it, thus being under no legal requirement to halt selling the book but after facing considerable controversy, and the release of a competitive, authorized (and more complete) edition by Houghton Mifflin and [[Ballantine Books]], Ace agreed let its still-popular edition go out of print and pay royalties to Tolkien.<ref name=tale>{{Webcite|articleurl=https://www.tolkiensociety.org/app/uploads/2016/11/LOTR-The-Tale-of-a-Text.pdf|author=[[Pat Reynolds]]|articlename=The Lord of the Rings: The Tale of a Text|website=tolkiensociety.org|accessed=27 January 2024}}</ref> It was customary to pay British authors 1/4 of profits in royalties but Ace agreed to pay 9,000, the total sum of their profit off ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Richard C.
