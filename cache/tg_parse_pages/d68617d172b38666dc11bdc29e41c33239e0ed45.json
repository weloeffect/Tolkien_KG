He was replaced by [[Viggo Mortensen]] after just four days of shooting because director [[Peter Jackson]] felt that he was too young to convincingly portray the character.\n\nIn February 2002, Townsend was interviewed by [http://www.ew.com Entertainment Weekly] about the experience: \n\n<blockquote>\n''\"You were originally cast in \"Lord of the Rings\" as Aragorn, then Viggo Mortensen stepped in just before shooting began. What happened?\"''\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\nTwo weeks ago I finally read an article where the filmmakers said, \"We were totally wrong about Stuart and we accept that it was our fault,\" which was so nice because I did get shafted up the a--. I was there rehearsing and training for two months, then was fired the day before filming began. After that I was told they wouldn't pay me because I was in breach of contract due to not having worked long enough. I had been having a rough time with them, so I was almost relieved to be leaving until they told me I wouldn't be paid. I have no good feelings for those people in charge, I really don't. [[Peter Jackson|The director]] wanted me and then apparently thought better of it because he really wanted someone 20 years older than me and completely different.\n</blockquote>\n::::[http://web.archive.org/web/20051212094200/http://www.ew.com/ew/report/0,6115,212325-2-2~1~0~,00.html Entertainment Weekly] interview with Stuart Townsend\n== External links ==\n* {{WP|Stuart Townsend}}\n* [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0870204/ Stuart Townsend] at IMDb\n\n[[Category:Actors and actresses|Townsend, Stuart]]\n[[Category:Irish people|Townsend, Stuart]]\n[[Category:People by name|Townsend, Stuart]]"}}}
