[[Vorondil the Hunter]], the father of [[Mardil|Mardil Voronwë]], hunted the beasts in the far fields of the East. So, after Mardil Voronwë it passed down to every eldest son.<ref name=\"MT\">{{RK|MT}}</ref> From [[Denethor]], it passed down to Boromir, who wore it with him on a baldric.<ref name=\"Council\">{{FR|Council}}</ref>\n\nBoromir bore the horn with him when he went to [[Rivendell|Imladris]], and held it on his lap during the [[Council of Elrond]].<ref name=\"Council\"/> After he was chosen to be one of the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]], he let the horn ring through Rivendell.<ref name=\"South\">{{FR|South}}</ref> He would wind the horn twice more. In reply to the meager horns of the [[Orcs]] in [[Moria]], the Great Horn bellowed like the shout of many throats under the cavernous roof. Though it repelled the attackers for a while, they returned after the last echo disappeared.<ref>{{FR|Bridge}}</ref> \n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Boromir's Last Stand.jpg|200px|right|thumb|''Boromir's Last Stand'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nThe last time the horn was rung was shortly before its destruction, on [[26 February|February 26]], on the slopes of [[Amon Hen]], near [[Parth Galen]]. While fighting, Boromir created a sound so loud that it could be heard in [[Minas Tirith]].<ref name=\"MT\"/> Sadly, the little help that could come - the rest of the Fellowship - could not make it in time. Though the Uruk-hai were at first dismayed and drew back, they returned more fierce than ever.<ref>{{TT|Uruk}}</ref> In the fight that cost Boromir's life, the horn was cloven in two. \n\n[[Aragorn]], [[Gimli]] and [[Legolas]] laid it in the elven boat with Boromir and his weapons and sent it down the falls of [[Rauros]].<ref name=\"Departure\">{{TT|Departure}}</ref> The two parts of the horn fell out of the boat, and were found several days later. One was found in the reeds near the mouths of [[Entwash]] on [[28 February|February 28]], the other further down the river on [[30 February|February 30]].<ref>{{HM|Scheme}}, p. 469</ref> They were brought to Denethor, who held them on his lap, anxiously waiting for news of his beloved son.<ref name=\"Window\"/> Those answers came, eventually, when [[Gandalf]] brought [[Peregrin Took]], witness to Boromir's last stand, before the Steward.<ref name=\"MT\"/>\n\n==Inspiration==\nBoth [[wikipedia:Roland|Roland]], the paladin of Charlemagne, and Boromir bore a white horn.<ref>[[Gerard Seaman]], \"Old French Literature\", published in ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia]]'' (edited by [[Michael Drout]]), p. 468-9</ref> Like Roland in battle with the Saracens blew his horn to call for Charlemagne, Boromir called for Aragorn.
