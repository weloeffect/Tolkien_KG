Now Andy Serkis tells his own story about how a three-week commission to provide a voiceover for Gollum grew into a five-year commitment to breathe life and soul into ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> most challenging creation.\n* Did the voice of Gollum really start with a cat being sick?\n* What was it like acting in a bodysuit covered in dots?\n* How much was Gollum modelled to look like Andy?\n* What surprises does ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' hold in store?<ref group=\"note\">This book was published two weeks before the première of the third instalment of Peter Jackson's movie series.</ref>\nFully illustrated with more than 100 exclusive behind-the-scenes photos and drawings, and with contributions from the many designers and animators who brought Gollum to life, this book examines the transition to the big screen of one of literature's most unforgettable creatures. As the filming takes him from London to Wellington, and from the [[Misty Mountains]] to [[Mount Doom]], Andy Serkis explains the methods - and the madness - behind the most amazing five years in an actor's life.\n\n==Interviewees==\n* Gino Acevedo\n* [[Philippa Boyens]]\n* Randall William Cook (animation design supervisor)\n* Melanie Cordan (digital creature designer)\n* Ngila Dickson\n* [[Daniel Falconer]] (designer/sculptor)\n* [[John Howe]]\n* [[Peter Jackson]]\n* [[Alan Lee]]\n* Warren Mahy (designer/sculptor)\n* Bay Raitt (creature facial lead designer)\n* Christian Rivers (digital designer)\n* Jim Rygiel (visual effects designer)\n* Mahria Sangster (mocap co-ordinator)\n* Jason Schleifer (digital creature designer)\n* Remington Scott (motion capture supervisor)\n* Mike Stevens (digital creature designer)\n* [[Richard Taylor]]\n* Mary Victoria (digital creature designer)\n* [[Fran Walsh]]\n* Chris Ward (ADR recordist)\n* Lisa Wildermoth (first assistant director, motion capture)\n* Ben Wootten (designer/sculptor)\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=\"note\"/>\n\n{{lordoftheringsfilms}}\n\n{{title|italics}}\n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings (film series) tie-in books]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
