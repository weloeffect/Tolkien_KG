This contrasted with the duties of the [[Second Marshal of the Riddermark|Second]] and [[Third Marshal of the Riddermark|Third]] marshals, whose duties were assigned by the King as the times demanded.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n== During the War of the Ring ==\nComing to the throne at a relatively young age, King [[Théoden]], the seventeenth King of Rohan, led the Riders of the Muster of Edoras himself, so that no First Marshal was needed, even in times of war. When the King later fell under [[Saruman]]'s power, [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]] worked to ensure that no First Marshal was appointed, leaving a vacuum of power for him to exploit.  It was thus that at the time of the [[War of the Ring]], there was no First Marshal of the Riddermark.<ref name=\":0\">{{UT|11b}}</ref>\n{{References}}\n{{rohirrimranks}}\n\n[[Category:Rohan]]\n[[Category:Mannish titles]]\n[[fi:Markin ensimmäinen marsalkka]]"}}}
