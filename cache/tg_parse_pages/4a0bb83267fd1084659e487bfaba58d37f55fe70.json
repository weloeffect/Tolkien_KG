Tolkien]] through French-language articles and essays. \n\n== History ==\n\nIn the early 1990s, ''Hisweloce'' (sic) initially debuted as an internal newsletter to the \"chair of geography\" of the French organization \"la Fée\",<ref name=\"fee\">[https://www.tolkienguide.com/modules/wiwimod/index.php?page=Activities1993France Tolkien Activities in France] and [https://www.marquette.edu/library/archives/Mss/JRRT/JRRT-hunnewell.php S.

There were six short irregular issues printed between 1992 and 1994.\n\nIn 1997, the author's personal site, hosted on Geocities, included, besides personal fiction, a \"Tolkien's corner\" section, which later evolved into ''Hiswelókë''. In the earlier days of the website, most articles and essays were originally collected into four editions of an e-zine.<ref name=\"Downloads\">[http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/site3 Hiswelókë], \"[http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/site3/download.php?lng=fr Téléchargements]\" (accessed [[January]] [[7 January|7]], [[2011]])</ref> In [[2002]], the website joined JRRVF and, hosted as a \"wing\" of this website, continued activities until around 2008, with articles available online independently. Aside from personal fiction, the website included articles on botany, linguistics, geography, mythology, [[wikipedia:onomastics|onomastics]] (the study of names) and reviews of other pieces of scholarly work.\n\nIn 2010, \"Le Dragon de Brume\" was transformed into a non-profit organization, mostly focused on publishing collections of essays.<ref name=\"dragondebrume\">[https://sites.google.com/site/dragonbrumeux/ Le Dragon de Brume], non-profit organization under the terms of French 1901 act (accessed [[April]], [[2021]])</ref> The old website being definitely abandoned, some of its remaining contents were gradually transferred to Tolkiendil.<ref name=\"tolkiendil\">[https://www.tolkiendil.com/essais/hisweloke Hiswelókë] on Tolkiendil (accessed [[April]], [[2021]])</ref> The pages on JRRVF are scheduled to be closed in 2021, excepted the Sindarin dictionary project (which will remain on JRRVF).\n\n== Sindarin dictionary ==\n\nSpecifically, from [[23 October|October 23]], [[1999]]<ref name=\"News\">[http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/index.html Hiswelókë's Sindarin dictionary], \"[http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/news.html News]\" (accessed [[January]] [[7 January|7]], [[2011]])</ref> the project has included '''Hiswelókë's Sindarin dictionary''' which aims to create a complete [[Sindarin]] dictionary - including annotations and relevant amendments - aimed at satisfying the requirements of both serious scholars and casual fans.<ref name=\"About\">[http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/index.html Hiswelókë's Sindarin dictionary], \"[http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/about.html About]\" (accessed [[January]] [[7 January|7]], [[2011]])</ref> \n\nAside from online wordlists, the project also included a downloadable [[wikipedia:XML|XML]] lexicon,<ref name=\"github\">''[https://github.com/Omikhleia/sindict A Sindarin and Noldorin dictionnary]'' in XML ([https://tei-c.org/ TEI] format)</ref> and the (now obsolete) [[Dragon Flame]] and Hesperides freeware applications.\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.tolkiendil.com/essais/hisweloke Homepage] (French)\n* [http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/index.html Hiswelókë's Sindarin dictionary] (English)\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Linguistic websites]]"}}}
