The history of the Gondorians is extensively dominated by the actions of the Dúnedain of the South.\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nIn [[Númenor]]ean colonies and outposts, such as [[Belfalas]] and [[Pelargir]], there were many [[Faithful]], fully or partially of [[Númenórean]] blood, who descended from [[Númenor]].<ref name=rings/> The Númenóreans venturing north of Pelargir met Men who had already settled in valleys on either side of the [[White Mountains]], and classified them \"[[Middle Men]]\" due to their friendliness to the [[West]], and recognized as descendants of the Men who abjured the [[Shadow]].<ref name=atani>{{PM|Atani}}</ref> There were many men of mingled blood, descended from the [[Men of the Mountains|Men of]] the [[White Mountains]] during the [[Dark Years]].<ref name=\"Minas Tirith\">{{RK|V1}}</ref> \n[[File:Anke Eißmann - Departure from Gondor.jpg|thumb|''Departure from Gondor'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]\nAfter the [[Downfall of Númenor]], the [[Exiles of Númenor]], led by [[Elendil]], established the [[Realms in Exile]]. Arriving at the [[Mouths of Anduin]], Elendil's sons, [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]], ascended the great river and founded the realm of Gondor. The colonists welcomed them and allied themselves with the founders of the [[Kingdoms of the Dúnedain]].<ref name=rings>{{s|Rings}}</ref><ref name=languages>{{App|Men}}</ref> Elendil made the Faithful nobles of his kin who ruled Belfalas \"[[Princes of Dol Amroth|Princes]]\".<ref name=\"Cirion\"/> Even the [[Pre-Númenóreans|non-Númenórean]] peoples, like the [[Men of the Mountains]], swore allegiance to Isildur.<ref>{{RK|V2}}</ref>\n\nOriginally ruled by their [[High King (Dúnedain)|High King]], the [[Dúnedain]] were divided as the [[Dúnedain of Arnor]] and the [[Dúnedain of the South|Dúnedain of Gondor]], following [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields|the death of Isildur]] ({{TA|2}}).

King [[Eldacar (King of Gondor)|Eldacar]], who himself had Northmannish blood, showed favour to the Northmen who supported him. The [[Kin-strife]] led to the loss of many Dúnedain. After his return from exile, many noble houses, including the royal [[House of Anárion]], became more mingled with the blood of [[Middle Men|\"lesser\" Men]].<ref name=gondor/>\n\nThe [[Great Plague]] decimated the Gondorians with many, including King [[Telemnar]] and his kin.<ref name=gondor/><ref name=rings/> \n\nAfter the reign of King [[Eärnur]], royal descendants among the Dúnedain of Gondor had become few and no claimant for the throne could be found of pure Númenórean blood, or whose claim all would accept, and people were afraid of a new Kin-strife that would devastate the kingdom.

In the early years of the realm, the Gondorians worked to erect mighty cities and monuments throughout their new land. Their original capital at [[Osgiliath]] had great stone bridges spanned the [[Anduin]], as well as mighty houses and towers of stone. Other works marvellous and strong they built in the land in the days of their power, at the [[Argonath]], and at [[Aglarond]], and at [[Erech]]; and at [[Isengard]], they made the [[Orthanc|Pinnacle of Orthanc]] of unbreakable stone.<ref name=rings/> They also built great roads that ran both north and south of the [[White Mountains]].<ref>{{RK|Ride}}</ref>\n\nThe Gondorians were very skilled in the arts of healing and medicine, having preserved much wisdom of [[Númenor]].<ref name=\"Cirion\"/> They were skilled in healing all such sickness [[Men]] were subject to.<ref name=Healing>{{RK|Houses}}</ref>\n\nThe Men of [[Gondor]] were noted for their great seafaring skills, especially naval warfare.
