It was the location of the [[Menelrond]], the hall where Thingol's Throne was situated.<ref>{{PM|XII}}</ref>\n\n=History=\n==Years of the Trees==\nDuring the ages of the [[Chaining of Melkor]], the [[Sindar]] had lived scattered in Beleriand, some at the havens of the [[Falas]], others in the woodlands of [[Region]] and [[Neldoreth]] where also their King [[Thingol]] and his queen [[Melian]] abode. When the third Age of Melkor's chaining began, Melian urged Thingol to build a fast place for their people. Thingol was on friendly terms with the Dwarves and he commissioned the [[Dwarves of Belegost]] to aid with the building of a fortress.\n\nMuch after the manner of the Dwarves they delved an underground fortress into a rocky hill on the banks of [[Esgalduin]], where the river turned to the west. The only entrance were gates high above the river, that at this place ran in a deep ravine and was crossed by a stone bridge. The place was thereafter known as Menegroth, the Thousand Caves, because so many were the halls the Dwarves had hewn out of the rock.\n\nAfter the [[First Battle of Beleriand]], many Elves who had not lived in the cities fled to Doriath, which was afterwards protected by the [[Girdle of Melian]].<ref name=\"Sindar\">{{S|Sindar}}</ref>\n\n==Years of the Sun==\nMenegroth and Doriath enjoyed peace for a long time. Thingol preferred a policy of isolationism and not to mingle in the affairs of the [[Noldor]], the [[Battles of Beleriand|War of the Jewels]] and the conflict with [[Morgoth]] in general. No host of Doriath participated in any of the great battles, except the First. Only with [[House of Finarfin|his kin]] in [[Nargothrond]] did Thingol remain in contact.<ref>{{S|Noldor}}</ref><ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>\n[[File:Felix Sotomayor - Beren at Thingol's Court.jpg|thumb|left|''Beren at Thingol's Court'' by [[Felix Sotomayor]]]]\nYet Menegroth also became entangled in the fate of the [[Silmaril]] and thus the [[Oath of Fëanor]] and the [[Doom of Mandos]]. When the man [[Beren]] asked for the hand of Thingol's daughter Lúthien in marriage, Thingol was affronted, thinking little of mortal men. As a bride price he demanded that Beren should bring one of the Silmarils from Morgoth's iron crown.<ref name=\"Beren\">{{S|Beren}}</ref>\n\nWith the help of Lúthien, Beren succeeded, but the price was high: [[Carcharoth]], the wolf who was guarding the Gates of [[Angband]], bit off the hand in which Beren was holding the Silmaril. Driven mad by the pain that the hallowed stone caused to him, searing his intestines, Carcharoth ravaged Beleriand and finally broke through Melian's Girdle, threatening Menegroth. He was confronted somewhat to the north-east from the city at the banks of Esgalduin and killed by [[Huan]] the Great Hound of Valinor, having wounded Beren mortally. The Silmaril was found in his stomach and thus found its way to Menegroth.<ref name=\"Beren\"/>\n\n===Sack of Doriath===\nYears later, [[Húrin Thalion]] brought as a gift, though his heart was bitter, the famed dwarf necklace [[Nauglamír]] to Thingol. Thingol then had become enchanted by the beauty of the Silmaril and in his mind made up a plan, to set the Silmaril into the Nauglamír. It happened that at this time a troop of [[Dwarves of Nogrod|Dwarves from Nogrod]] were in Menegroth. Thingol offered a high price to them if they managed to set the stone into the Nauglamír. But seeing the unrivalled jewel and the necklace a great desire and greed came upon them to possess both. When they had finished their work they claimed the treasure; Thingol was slain by them and they fled from Menegroth.<ref name=\"Ruin\">{{S|Doriath}}</ref>\n\nNews of the event spread fast and the Dwarves were hunted and slain. Two of them escaped and told a crooked tale about how they were betrayed and their brethren slaughtered by the Elves. The Dwarves of Nogrod rose in anger and mustered a great army. Doriath lay open to their onslaught; the Girdle was gone since Melian, in deep sorrow for her husband's death, had left Middle-earth.<ref name=\"Ruin\"/>\n[[File:Henning Janssen - Nauglamir and the Doom of Thingol.jpg|thumb|''Nauglamir and the Doom of Thingol'' by [[Henning Janssen]]]]\nThe Dwarves invaded Doriath and found little resistance as the captains of the Sindar were indecisive and despaired, and attacked Menegroth. Many Dwarves and Elves were slain during a [[battle in the Thousand Caves]]. [[Mablung]], captain of the guard, was slain at the doors of the treasure chamber where the Nauglamír was stored. This terrible event then led to the distrust that thereafter remained between Elves and Dwarves. However, on their way back, the Dwarves were waylaid at [[Sarn Athrad]] by the [[Laiquendi]] led by [[Beren]] and their king was slain by Beren in single combat. The remainder of their host was destroyed by [[Ents]].<ref name=\"Ruin\"/>\n\n===Second Kinslaying and ruin===\nThe Nauglamír with the Silmaril was thereafter worn by Lúthien at [[Tol Galen]] in [[Ossiriand]]. Although weakened, the Kingdom of Doriath continued for [[Dior|Dior Eluchíl]] son of Lúthien and Beren took up the crown. However, after the death of Lúthien and Beren the Nauglamír was returned to Doriath. The [[Oath of Fëanor]] stirred again and the [[Sons of Fëanor]] stated their claim on the Silmaril. Dior refused to hand over the stone for which his parents had endured so much. [[Celegorm]] instigated his brothers and in the midst of winter their hosts deployed at the gates of Menegroth and for a second time Elves were slain by Elves.<ref name=\"Ruin\"/>\n\nDior and [[Nimloth|his wife]] were slain, and of the seven Sons of Fëanor only four survived the battle. Dior's sons, [[Eluréd]] and [[Elurín]], were abandoned in the forest to die, but his daughter [[Elwing]] fled to the havens at the [[Mouths of Sirion]], bearing the Silmaril with her. The realm of Menegroth did not endure this second slaughtering and did not rise again.<ref name=\"Ruin\"/>\n\n==Description==\nMenegroth was a wholly underground city accessed only through a stone bridge over Esgalduin. While the Dwarves did the major work, the Elves also participated in the construction: the pillars imitated beeches with branches and leaves, the halls were lit by golden lanterns and there were silver fountains, and many figurines of animals. It is told that nightingales and other birds lived within the caves. Thus Thingol had the most beautiful palace a king ever had owned east of the Sea.<ref name=\"Sindar\"/>\n\nThis description can be found in the ''[[Lay of Leithian]]'':\n[[File:Henning Janssen - Stairs in the Thousand Caves.jpg|thumb|''Stairs in the Thousand Caves'' by [[Henning Janssen]]]]\n[[File:Pete Amachree - Melian the Maia and her daughter Lúthien, in the throne room of Menegroth.jpg|thumb|''Melian the Maia and her daughter Lúthien, in the throne room of Menegroth'' by [[:Category:Images_by_Pete_Amachree|Pete Amachree]]]]\n[[File:Pete Amachree - Daeron at the court of Menegroth.jpg|thumb|''Daeron at the court of Menegroth'' by [[:Category:Images_by_Pete_Amachree|Pete Amachree]]]]\n{{blockquote|...through corridors of carven dread<br />\nwhose turns were lit by lanterns hung<br />\nor flames from torches that were flung<br />\non dragons hewn in the cold stone<br />\nwith jewelled eyes and teeth of bone.<br />\nThen sudden, deep beneath the earth<br />\nthe silences with silver mirth<br />\nwere shaken and the rocks were ringing,<br />\nthe birds of Melian were singing;<br />\nand wide the ways of shadow spread<br />\nas into arched halls she led<br />\n[[Beren]] in wonder.
