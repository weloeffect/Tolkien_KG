During a raid by [[Andróg]] and their captain, [[Forweg]], the daughter of Larnach's was straying outside the fenced homestead and the two outlaws pursued her for a mile before Forweg was slain by [[Túrin|Neithan]], who rejected Larnach’s daughter’s suggestion of also killing Andróg for twice the reward from Larnach.<ref name=Outlaws>{{CH|6}}</ref>{{rp|104}} Upon telling the other outlaws what had happened, Andróg later misinterpreted this exchange as his head being offered by Neithan to Larnach as a \"bride-price\" for his daughter.<ref name=Outlaws/>{{rp|105–6}}\n\nIn his search for Túrin, [[Beleg|Beleg Strongbow]] later came upon the fenced homestead that was Larnach's home, and was told of the incident by Larnach's daughter. When Larnach asked Beleg to decipher the strange events, he knew that it was Túrin that they spoke of, and warned them of [[Orcs]] gathering in the north. While many of the Woodmen took Beleg's advise, it is unknown if Larnach was among them. If he did, then he sent his daughter to [[Brethil]], yet regardless of whether he did or did not, he either was among the armed men that tried fighting their way into Brethil, or he was killed or captured by the Orcs.<ref name=Outlaws/>{{rp|108–9}}\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Larnach'' is a name of an unknown meaning.\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| LAR | |LAR='''LARNACH'''<br /><small>''b. {{FA}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| |!| | |}}\n{{familytree| DAU | |DAU=''Unnamed daughter''<br /><small>''b. {{FA}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Edain]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Folk of Haleth]]\n\n[[de:Larnach]]"}}}
