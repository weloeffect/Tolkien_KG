His gardener, the [[Snow Man]], is the eldest of them. They aren't snowmen made of snow of course, as Father Christmas clarifies in one letter; however in another letter he says that the Snow Man broke himself and he used what was left of him to draw a white picture.\n\nTheir children, the Snow-boys often help Father Christmas, as one time when they battled the [[Goblins]]. One time the [[North Polar Bear]] was too lazy packing the presents and he called the Snow-boys for help to the cellars (although they aren't allowed there) and started playing, causing his fur to be burned by the crackers.\n{{WLFC}}\n[[Category:Letters from Father Christmas]]"}}}
