His most known prophesy was \"''Great is the [[fall of Gondolin]]''\", which was quoted again by [[Turgon]], King of [[Gondolin]], at the time the event took place.<ref>{{LT2|III}}, p. 184</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn the first version of the [[Doom of Mandos]] appearing in ''The Book of Lost Tales'', it is a servant of [[Vefántur]] who proclaims, among other misfortunes, the fall of Gondolin; and the [[Noldoli]] remembered those words as the \"Prophecies of Amnos\" (''[[Amnos]]'' being the place where they had heard them).<ref>{{LT1|VII}}, p. 167</ref> Later, [[Tolkien]] wrote a couple of notes referring to the \"Prophecy of Amnon\", with the words \"''Great is the fall of Gondolin. When the [[Lothengriol|lily of the valley]] withers then shall Turgon fade''\", but it is unclear if here ''Amnon'' is a place or a person. As [[Christopher Tolkien]] suggests, the prophet Amnon could be the servant of Vefántur that proclaimed the doom of the Noldoli.<ref>{{LT1|VIIn}}, p. 172</ref> \n\n== Inspiration ==\nIn the Bible, Amnon was the wicked eldest son of David. [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] was surely aware of this character (as he was a Catholic), and it is curious to speculate on his particular choosing of this name, as it was in his earlier works.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Characters of unknown race]]\n[[Category:Qenya names]]"}}}
