This scene was not featured in the theatrical release of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\nAs [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] make their way through [[Emyn Muil]], they descend a small cliff using the [[Elven rope]] given to Sam by [[Galadriel]] in [[Lothlorien]]. As Sam's foot slips on a loose chunk of stone, a small wooden box slips out of his pocket, which Frodo manages to catch. When they reach the bottom, Sam reveals that the box contains high-quality salt from [[The Shire]], which he brought in case they were able to roast a chicken at some point. While Frodo can't help laughing at such an apparently naive hope, he is still touched that Sam was able to bring a small piece of home with them.\n\nFrodo doesn't like the idea of leaving the rope behind in case someone tries to follow them, and Sam doesn't want to part with Galadriel's gift, but the latter admits that his knot won't be easily undone. Yet when Sam gives the rope a single tug and it comes undone with no resistance, Frodo looks at him and simply replies ''\"Real Elvish rope.\"'' with a slightly mocking smile on his face.     \n\n{{title}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers scenes|02]]"}}}
