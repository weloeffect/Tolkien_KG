Tolkien had a cat called Grimalkin:'''\" is the first line of a clerihew written by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] as part of [[Letter 309|a letter]] to Amy Ronald on [[2 January]] of [[1969]].<ref name=\"letter\">{{L|309}}, p. 398</ref>\n\n==Poem==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\n:J.R.R. Tolkien\n:had a cat called Grimalkin:\n:once a familiar of Herr Grimm,\n:now he spoke the law to him.<ref name=\"letter\"/></poem>\n\n==Background==\nOn [[2 January]], [[1969]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote a clerihew about himself at the end of [[Letter 309|a letter]] sent to Amy Ronald.<ref name=\"letter\"/> The clerihew, along with the letter, was published for the first time in ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'' in [[1981]].<ref name=\"letter\"/> In [[1995]], the clerihew was reprinted in the article \"[https://dc.swosu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2156&context=mythlore J.R.R. Tolkien and the Clerihew]\", where [[Joe R. Christopher]] notes that it violates the rule that each line should begin with a capital letter.<ref name=\"Christopher\"/> Christopher also notes that \"the rhyme of the first two lines is not perfect\".<ref name=\"Christopher\"/> He explains that Tolkien's use of the name Grimalkin is interesting in that it<ref name=\"Christopher\"/>{{Blockquote|derives from ''grey'' + ''malkin''. ''Malkin''…usually means a woman, being a variety of ''Matilda'' or ''Maud''…''grimalkin'' usually refers to a cat, especially a she-cat, although occasionally a woman. (Tolkien uses the masculine pronoun for this cat in his fourth line.)<ref name=\"Christopher\"/>}} After giving an example of \"one version of the four lines\", Christopher describes \"the major stresses…and the rhythms\" as being \"equally varied\", that \"''mal''- and -''mil''-\" in \"the second and third lines\" are tied together by \"a consonance\", and that \"''Herr'' and ''him''\" in \"the third and fourth lines\" connect through \"alliteration\". He also notes that \"the ''gr'' of ''Grimalkin'' echoes the sound in the stressed syllable ''Grimm''\", which is significant because it \"connects two of the important terms\".<ref name=\"Christopher\"/> Christopher adds that \"the verse…is perhaps too mysterious to be a good clerihew, but the play with Grimm's law produces a surprising shift from witchcraft to philology and in that sense may be humorous\".<ref name=\"Christopher\"/> In [[September]] of [[2024]], the poem was reprinted in Appendix I in ''[[The Collected Poems of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', where [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] suggest in their commentary that Tolkien's use of the name Grimalkin could also mean \"friend, associate\".<ref name=collectedpoems>{{CP|A1}}, \"Clerihews\"</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\n[[Joe R. Christopher]] comments \"that the first discovered use of a form of ''grimalkin'' is in [[Wikipedia:William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Wikipedia:Macbeth|Macbeth]]''\" in 1605 where the name \"Gray-Malkin refers to a Fiend\". Christopher further notes that \"the dotty or whimsical aspect of this clerihew\" is that Tolkien \"does not mean anything serous by saying that he and Jakob Grimm…had the same familiar\". In using the name Grimalkin, Tolkien may possibly have been inspired by \"[[Wikipedia:John Masefield|John Masefield's]] ''[[Wikipedia:The Midnight Folk|The Midnight Folk]]'', a children's book of [[1927]]\", where Greymalkin is the name of an evil cat. Since Tolkien spelled the name as Grimalkin:<ref name=\"Christopher\"/>{{blockquote|the law that is spoken could be taken as some…supernatural rule or simply the stubbornness of cats demanding food, for example; but the actual reference no doubt is to a philological rule about the changes in the Indo-European language when German developed out of it.…This rule is known as Grimm’s Law. Did the familiar inspire Grimm with the law, or did Grimm teach it to his cat. Given the ambiguous pronouns, did Grimalkin recite the Law to Tolkien or ''vice versa''? (Under the general rule of thumb that a pronoun refers back to the most immediate noun, presumably the former - but it is not quite certain.) The clerihew has an uncertain meter in the first two lines. As has been said of an earlier clerihew, it is difficult to know how one should read those opening initials.<ref name=\"Christopher\"/>}}\n\n{{References}}\n\n{{Poems}}\n\n[[Category:Limericks and clerihews]]"}}}
