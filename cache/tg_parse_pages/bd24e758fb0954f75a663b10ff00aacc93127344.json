The song name is taken from the [[Dagor Bragollach]], the fourth great battle of the [[Wars of Beleriand]], fought between the forces of [[Morgoth]] and the league of the [[Noldor]]. The lyrics directly reference the battle itself, and the destruction of [[Ard-galen]].\n\n== Lyrics ==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nIn the year 455 it began, the battle of rapid fire. \nAnnounced threw flames, \nmore deadly then the third battle. \nStreams of fire flowing out of Thangorodrim and burned Ardgalen \nAnd with the flame a see of orcs arived, \nand balrogs and Glaurung the dragon. \nHaving received all his might now Dor Thonion broke down first under this onset \nAngrod and aegnor where killed and their folk enslaved. \nThe riders of maglor where sacrifices of the flames. \nOn the planes of Lothlann victory on our side the triumph of Morgoth.\n</poem>\n{{title}}\n[[Category:Songs by Summoning]]"}}}
