Among other renderings, it is termed the \"one beginning\",<ref name=reincarnation>{{NM|Reincarnation}}</ref> or the \"Prime Impulse\".<ref name=impulse>{{NM|Impulse}}</ref> \n\nA view held by some was that Ermenië referred to the start of life ''within'' the Tale of [[Arda]].<ref name=reincarnation /> In this view, the matters of [[Eä]] proceeded from a single [[Erma]] (\"Prime matter\") which was shaped into [[nassi]] (\"forms\", in this case, as \"materials\").<ref name=impulse/> Ermenië, the start of life, was then introduced, and it the unfolding of it was [[Ercantië]] (the \"Prime Pattern\"). Eventually, by catastrophe or simply the cessation of the impulse in living things to generate, Ercantië would complete and thus end. Following this, nassi would be reduced to Erma, and the Tale would end as it began.<ref name=impulse/>\n\nHowever, another view, held to be more true to lore received from the [[Valar]] and experienced history, was that Ermenië referred to the ''uttermost'' beginning, before Eä was even realized. In this view Ermenië referred to the first Theme which [[Eru]] taught to the [[Ainur]], which they then cooperatively elaborated on during the [[Ainulindalë]]. In this view, there was no single Prime Pattern of life (Ercantië), but a great number of early ''Major'' Patterns ([[Arcantië|Arcantiër]]).<ref name=impulse />\n\nThe potential catastrophe in which all living things perished was thought to be a possible outcome achievable by [[Melkor]]. This might be brought about in the event of him making a last attempt to achieve mastery or revenge of destruction.<ref name=impulse />{{rp|note 8}}\n\n==Etymology==\n''Ermenië'' is a compound of '''[[Er]]''' (\"one\", \"single\", \"prime\"; when capitalized is a reference to Eru<ref>https://www.elvish.org/Tengwestie/articles/DeRosarioMartinez/natureofmiddleearthreview.pdf</ref>) and ''*[[mēnie]]'' (\"determination\", \"impulse\", \"device\")\n\nIt is variously rendered as the '''Prime Impulse''',<ref name=impulse /> the '''Device of Eru''',<ref name=impulse /> the '''Theme of Eru''',<ref name=impulse /> and the '''one beginning'''.<ref name=reincarnation />\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[Ambarmenié]]'': \"Way of the world\"<ref>{{NM|Fate}}</ref>\n\n== Analogies in philosophy==\n[[Carl F.
