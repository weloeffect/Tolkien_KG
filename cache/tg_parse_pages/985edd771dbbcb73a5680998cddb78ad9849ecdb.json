Daffodil was invented by [[Amazon Studios]] for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]''.\n\n== History ==\nNot much is known about Daffodil Burrows. At one point in time during the late [[Second Age]], she was lost to [[Wolves]] during one of the seasonal migrations, leaving her husband, [[Sadoc Burrows]], to grieve for her in spirit during the remembrance ceremony of the [[Harvest Festival]].\n\nLater, as the sun rose after Sadoc is mortally wounded by the [[Mystics|Nomad]] at the [[East Bight]], he died believing in his heart that he would soon see his wife, Daffodil Burrows, again.\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Hobbits from adaptations]]"}}}
