He also wrote to his aunt who lived in Wales that he had used prize money (from the Skeat Prize for English) to buy a Welsh grammar written by Sir John Morris Jones.<ref>{{L|241}}</ref>\n\nTolkien was thanked for having helped \"untiringly with problems of Celtic philology\" in preparing the book ''[[Roman Britain and the English Settlements]]'' ([[1936]]).<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.tolkienbooks.net/php/othercredits.php|articlename=Other credits|dated=|website=TB|accessed=15 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Celtic influences on the legendarium==\n===Mythology===\nTolkien claimed knowledge of Celtic languages and legends, but expressed a dislike in Celtic legends and denied that his legendarium is \"Celtic\".<ref>{{HM|Bio}}, p. 26</ref>\n\nHowever, Celtic concepts are present in some views about the [[Elves]] (see [[Elves#Celtic influence|Elves - Celtic influence]]).\n\n===Other names===\nWhile the [[Westron]] world displays [[North Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Old English]] elements, Tolkien mentioned that the survival of traces of the older language of the [[Stoors]] and the Bree-men in [[Eriador]] resembled the survival of Celtic elements in England, that the names of the [[Bucklanders]] had a vaguely 'Celtic' style and that Bree, Combe (Coomb), Archet and Chetwood are modelled on relics of British (i.e. Celtic) names that were chosen according to their sense.<ref>{{App|Translation}}, p. 1135</ref> Tolkien also told the Dutch Translator, [[Max Schuchart]], that there were \"'Celtic' elements in [[Buckland]] and [[Eastfarthing|East-farthing]] names.\"<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 93</ref> <ref name=\"granddad\">{{PM|Languages}}, typescript F 4, text 'A' of the second section</ref> He stated in his guide for translators for the translation of names in ''The Lord of the Rings'' into other languages that he gave Hobbits from Buckland Welsh names or names of similar style and that Gorhendad meant \"great-grandfather\" in Welsh<ref>{{HM|N}}, entry '''Oldbuck''', p. 761</ref> as well as that Archet had a Celtic origin and was descended from Welsh argoed<ref>{{HM|N}}, entry '''Archet''', p. 765</ref>.\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien mentioned that he gave names in [[Buckland]] – such as [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Meriadoc]] or [[Gorhendad Oldbuck|Gorhendad]] – a \"Celtic cast\", and that the relation of Welsh or British to English was somewhat similar to the relation of the older language of the Stoors and Bree-men to Westron. He also noted that many of the actual Buckland and Bree names – such as [[Marroc Brandybuck|Marroc]], [[Madoc Brandybuck|Madoc]] and [[Seredic Brandybuck|Seredic]] – had something of a Celtic style and the often had -ac, -ic or -oc as their ending.<ref name=\"granddad\" />\n\nThese analogies are present mostly relating to [[Pre-Númenóreans]] and the [[Stoors|Stoor]] [[hobbits]], which is evident in place-names such as \"[[Bree]]\", and the personal names of the [[Bucklanders]]. According to [[Paula Marmor]], the Celtic elements in [[Stoorish]] names represent [[Pre-Númenórean|an earlier language]] related to that of the [[Bree-landers]].<ref>{{HM|IE}}, \"An etymological excursion among the Shire folk\"</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the majority of genuine Celtic names is seen in the family trees of the [[Brandybuck]]s. Names such as [[Rorimac Brandybuck|Rorimac]], [[Dinodas Brandybuck|Dinodas]], [[Gorbadoc Brandybuck|Gorbadoc]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Meriadoc]], and [[Marmadoc Brandybuck|Marmadoc]] are Celtic.<ref>{{HM|IE}}, \"Giving of names\"</ref>\n\nOther names having (or have been suggested as having) a Celtic influence include:\n*''[[Archet#Etymology|Archet]]''\n*''[[Bree#Etymology|Bree]]''\n*''[[Carn Dûm#Etymology|Carn Dûm]]''\n*''[[Carrock#Etymology|Carrock]]''\n*''[[Chetwood#Etymology|Chetwood]]''\n*''[[Combe#Etymology|Combe]]''\n*''[[Crickhollow#Etymology|Crickhollow]]''\n*''[[The Yale#Etymology|Yale]]''\n\nEdward Crankshaw, a reader for [[Allen & Unwin]], was assigned to review the current draft of the \"[[Quenta Silmarillion]]\" in 1937. He had a mostly favourable attitude to it, but he said that the names were \"eye-splitting Celtic names\". [[Tolkien]] denied Celtic influences in his Elvish names, and he showed distaste for Celtic words.<ref name=\"L19\" />\n\n===Sindarin===\nTolkien explained that he deliberately gave the language [[Sindarin]] a linguistic character like, but not identical with [[Welsh|British-Welsh]],<ref>{{L|144}}</ref> and was constructed to resemble Welsh phonologically<ref>{{L|165|44}}</ref>. He also mentioned that the lenitions or 'mutations' of Sindarin were deliberately made to resemble those of Welsh in phonetic origin and grammatical use, but are not the same in either of those two aspects.<ref>{{L|347}}</ref>\n\n==External links==\n*[http://dimitrafimi.com/teaching/mad-elves-and-elusive-beauty-some-celtic-strands-of-tolkiens-mythology/ “Mad” Elves and “Elusive Beauty”: Some Celtic Strands of Tolkien’s Mythology] by [[Dimitra Fimi]]\n*''[http://middle-earth.xenite.org/2012/11/14/how-much-was-tolkien-influenced-by-irish-mythology/ Tolkien influenced by Irish mythology?]'' by [[Michael Martinez]]\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Languages (real-world)]]"}}}
