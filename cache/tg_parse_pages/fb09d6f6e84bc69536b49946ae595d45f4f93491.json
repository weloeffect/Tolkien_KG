Lower Lebennin was the eastern-most area in Central Gondor and Upper Lebennin was the western-most area in Eastern Gondor. [[Dor-en-Ernil]] lay to the west across the river [[Gilrain]] and [[Lossarnach]] lay to the east across the river [[Erui]].

The smaller settlements, some of which had fallen to enemy forces before the breaking of the [[Siege of Gondor]], included \"Ethilorn\", \"Sarnhad\", \"Malbarth\", \"Aerthir\", \"Lornost\", \"Erynos\", and \"Halach\". A local tradition in Lebennin was the offering of gift baskets to the rivers in honor of the Five Sisters of Lebennin, though by the end of the [[Third Age]] few believed the Sisters were any more than a myth.\n\n{{references}}\n{{FellowshipRoute}}\n[[Category:Regions of Gondor]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]"}}}
