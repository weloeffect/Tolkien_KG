The smell was overwhelmingly bad. Gollum reported that the cave was the entrance to a tunnel, but he did not say its name, [[Shelob's Lair]]. Despite the possibility that the cave was filled with [[Orcs]], Sam and Frodo knew that they must enter.\n\nThe tunnel was totally dark, and the [[Hobbits]] proceeded by feeling the walls. Strangely, Gollum disappeared, leaving the Hobbits to find their way themselves. Suddenly, Frodo was aware of an intense feeling of hostility and danger emanating from the darkness. They heard a bubbling hiss, but could see nothing. Sam shouted to Frodo to raise the [[Phial of Galadriel]], a small container blessed by [[Galadriel]] that Frodo wore around his neck. The phial shone a strong light that illuminated hundreds of tiny eyes, all of them staring at the hobbits. The eyes belonged to [[Shelob]], a giant spider-monster ever hungry for creatures to devour, used by the evil [[Sauron]] to guard his passages.\n\nFrodo was terrified, but he walked boldly toward the eyes, which retreated as he advanced. The Hobbits headed for the end of the tunnel, but were held up by cobwebs stretched across the passageway. The cobwebs were too strong to be cut by a knife, and the Hobbits feared they were trapped until Frodo remembered [[Sting]], his [[Elves|Elven]]-made knife. They cut their way through, and the Hobbits were within view of the exit from the tunnel. Frodo shouted that they should run and pulled ahead. Sam lifted the phial to see, noticed that there were orcs ahead, though, and hid the phial. Suddenly Shelob attacked, moving swiftly between Sam and Frodo. Sam shouted a warning to his master, but he was silenced by the clammy hand of Gollum, who had betrayed the Hobbits by leading them to Shelob. Sam removed himself from Gollum’s grasp and threatened to stab him, but Gollum moved quickly away.\n==Composition==\nThe chapter was probably written around [[May]] [[1944]].\n\nBy that time Tolkien's earlier sketches had been obsoleted (because motives and times had changed) and wrote the last three chapters of Book III with great effort, and changing the sequence of events.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. xxv</ref>\n{{References}}\n{{title}}\n[[fi:Lukitarin luola (TSH)]]\n[[Category:The Two Towers chapters]]"}}}
