He wrote that these references are so that Pauline Baynes can roughly judge the climate and the fauna and flora for her [[A Map of Middle-earth|map of Middle-earth]]. In addition, he wrote in a [[Letter 294|letter to Charlotte and Denis Plimmer]] that the city of Pelargir is approximately at the latitude of ancient Troy. J.R.R. Tolkiens mentions that Ithilien was open to the moist winds from the sea and sheltered from the east by the Ephel Dúath in the context of the vegetation in Ithilien in The Lord of the Rings. Those two factors probably also apply to South Gondor.</ref>\n\n==History==\nSouth Gondor was absorbed by Gondor during the height of its power, probably the expansions of [[Tarannon Falastur]], who extended the sway of Gondor along the coasts west and south of the Mouths of Anduin<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry for king Tarannon, p. 1044</ref>.<ref>{{HM|AME}}, \"The Third Age - Kingdoms of the Dunedain\", p. 55</ref>\n\nSouth Gondor remained a part of Gondor until the [[Kin-strife]] after which it became a debatable land between the [[Corsairs of Umbar]] and the [[Kings of Gondor]].<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry for king Eldacar, p. 1047</ref>\n\nDuring the days of [[Ruling Stewards|Steward]] [[Túrin II]], the Haradrim occupied South Gondor and there was much fighting along the [[Poros]].
