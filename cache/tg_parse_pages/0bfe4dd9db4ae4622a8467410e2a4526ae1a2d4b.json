Finrod was like his father in his fair face and golden hair, and also in his noble and generous heart. \n\nIn [[Beleriand]], Finrod became the ruler of [[Nargothrond]], taking the [[Epessë|after-name]] of '''Felagund'''. He was a wise, just and powerful Elf, and a great traveller.<ref>[[Robert Foster]], ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', p. 144</ref>\n\n==History==\nFinrod was born in [[Eldamar]] in the [[Year of the Trees 1300]] within the [[First Age]], the same as his cousin [[Turgon]].<ref>{{AA|85|note}}</ref> They were friends, and his beloved was [[Amarië]] of the [[Vanyar]].\n\nFinrod was like his father in his fair face and golden hair, and also in noble and generous heart, though he had the high courage of the Noldor and in his youth their eagerness and unrest; and he had also from his Telerin mother a love of the sea and dreams of far lands that he had never seen.<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref>\n\nFinrod was among those who opposed [[Fëanor]] and the [[Exile of the Noldor]]. However, when the Noldor were set to depart from [[Aman]], he joined them, for he would not be sundered from his friends and his people who were eager to go. Also, he had no wish to abandon his people to Fëanor's rule.<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref>\n\n===Return of the Noldor===\nFinrod, along with his father, led the rear of the host along with many of the noblest and wisest of the Noldor; and often they looked behind them to see their fair city, especially Finrod, for he had to leave Amarië behind. With him, he brought along many treasures from [[Tirion]],<ref name=\"return\">{{S|Return}}</ref> including [[Ring of Barahir|his Ring]].<ref name=\"beren\">{{S|Beren}}</ref>\n\nFinrod and his people did not participate in the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë]]. While they were travelling up the coast of [[Araman]], the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Mandos]] appeared and pronounced the [[Doom of the Noldor]], and in that hour, Finarfin forsook the march and returned to [[Valinor]] with many of his people. However, Finrod and his siblings went forward still and led their people on the long and perilous march to [[Middle-earth]].\n\n===Life in Beleriand===\nAfter their victory in the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]], the Noldor started building their numerous realms. Finrod established the tower of [[Minas Tirith (Beleriand)|Minas Tirith]] on the island of [[Tol Sirion]]. Once, while journeying southward along the river [[Sirion]], Finrod and his friend [[Turgon]] encamped upon its banks. [[Ulmo]], coming up the river, laid a deep sleep upon them and heavy dreams; and it seemed to each that he was bidden to prepare for a day of evil, and to establish a retreat, lest [[Morgoth]] should burst from [[Angband]] and overthrow the armies of the North.\n\n[[File:Mysilvergreen - Finrod Felagund.jpg|left|thumb|''Finrod Felagund'' by [[:Category:Images by Mysilvergreen|Mysilvergreen]]]]\nNow on a time Finrod and his sister [[Galadriel]] were guests of King [[Thingol|Elu Thingol]], their kinsman in [[Doriath]]. There, Finrod told Thingol of his admiration for the halls of [[Menegroth]]; and Thingol spoke to him of the deep gorge of the river [[Narog]] and told him about the caves under the [[High Faroth]] in its deep western shore. Thus Finrod came to the [[Caverns of Narog]] and established there deep halls and armouries; and that stronghold was called [[Nargothrond]]. In this he was aided by the [[Dwarves]] of the [[Blue Mountains]], and Finrod rewarded them with many jewels from Valinor. In that time, the [[Nauglamír]] was made for him, the Necklace of the Dwarves. After Nargothrond was made, Finrod committed Minas Tirith to the keeping of [[Orodreth]], his nephew, and was referred to by the additional name of ''Felagund'', an honorific title given him by the Dwarves, meaning a \"Maker of Caves\".\n\nThe realm of Nargothrond extended to the sea, excluding the [[Falas]]. Finrod was a friend and ally of [[Círdan]], and had also built the tower [[Barad Nimras]] upon the cape.<ref>{{S|14}}</ref>\n\n===Encounter with Men===\n[[File:Steamey - Finrod, Beor and the Green-elves of Ossiriand.jpg|thumb|''Finrod, Beor and the Green-elves of Ossiriand'' by [[:Category:Images by Steamey|Steamy]]]]\nWhen over three hundred years had passed since the Noldor came to Beleriand, Finrod journeyed east of Sirion and went hunting with [[Maglor]] and [[Maedhros]], two of the [[sons of Fëanor]]. But he wearied of the hunt and passed on alone towards the mountains of [[Ered Lindon]]. There, in the lands of [[Thargelion]], in [[East Beleriand]], Finrod was the first of the Noldor to come across [[Men]]. These were the kindred and followers of [[Bëor]] [[The Old]]. He went among them while they were sleeping and, picking up a harp which Bëor had laid aside, played music upon it such as the ears of men had not heard. When the men awoke and listened to his song, each thought that he was in some fair dream. He long stayed with them, learning [[Taliska|their language]] and teaching them [[Sindarin]]. He also intervened on behalf of the [[Laiquendi]] of [[Ossiriand]], who feared Men would destroy their home, and he got permission of [[Thingol]], who held rule over all [[Beleriand]], to guide the Men to [[Estolad]].<ref name=\"West\">{{S|West}}</ref>\n\nFinrod had a close friendship with [[Andreth]] of the [[House of Bëor]], whom he often visited during the [[Siege of Angband]] to converse with her on the matters of Elves and Men. One such conversation was written down and later known as ''[[Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth]]''.\n\nFinrod participated in the [[Dagor Bragollach]], fighting in the [[Fen of Serech]], when he was surrounded by [[Orcs]]. It was [[Barahir]] of the [[House of Bëor]] who saved his life, and Finrod swore an oath of abiding friendship and aid in every need to Barahir and all his kin. As a token he gave Barahir his ring, which became known as the [[Ring of Barahir]].<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>\n\n===Quest for the Silmaril===\n[[File:Anke Eißmann - Finrod is reminded of his oath.jpeg|thumb|''Finrod is reminded of his oath'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]\nWhen, ten years later, Barahir's son [[Beren]] came to Nargothrond seeking help, Finrod went with him on the [[Quest for the Silmaril]] to repay his debt. [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]], who were living in Nargothrond at the time, persuaded (using barely veiled threats related to their [[Oath of Fëanor|Oath]]) most of Nargothrond to stay behind. Only ten warriors, headed by one [[Edrahil]], were faithful and came with them. Beneath the [[Shadowy Mountains]] they came upon a company of [[Orcs]], and slew them all in their camp. They took their gear and weapons, and by the magic of Finrod, their own forms and faces were changed to the likeness of Orcs. Thus disguised, they came far upon their northward road between [[Ered Wethrin]] and the highlands of [[Taur-nu-Fuin (Dorthonion)|Taur-nu-Fuin]]. However, the twelve were captured and imprisoned by [[Sauron]] on [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]] (\"Isle of Werewolves\").<ref name=\"beren\" />\n\nThus befell the contest of Finrod and Sauron. Finrod strove with Sauron in [[He chanted a song of wizardry,|songs of power]], and the power of the Elven King was very great. But in the end, Sauron had the mastery.\n\n[[File:Anke Eißmann - Death of Finrod Felagund.jpeg|thumb|''Death of Finrod Felagund'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]\nThen Sauron stripped from them their disguise, but though their kinds were revealed, he could not discover their names or their purposes. \n\nSauron imprisoned them and one by one they were killed by werewolves until only Beren and Felagund were left, but none of the companions betrayed them. When the werewolf came to kill Beren, Felagund put forth all his power and burst his bonds. He wrestled with the werewolf, and slew it with his hands and teeth. Yet he himself was mortally wounded, and he died in the dark, in Tol-in-Gaurhoth, whose great tower he himself had built. Thus King Finrod Felagund, the fairest and most beloved of the house of [[Finwë]], redeemed his oath.\n\n===Reincarnation===\n[[File:Donato Giancola - Lore.jpeg|thumb|An Elf loremaster ponders at a mural of Finrod leading his House in battle. Art by [[Donato Giancola]]]]\nBefore the First Age ended after the [[War of Wrath]], the exiled Noldor were all under a ban imposed by [[Manwë]] and could not return in bodily form to the Blessed Realm.<ref>{{PM|Last}}, Glorfindel II, p. 380</ref> However, as a reward for his noble and selfless actions in life, as well as his reluctance to depart the [[Undying Lands]] for Middle-earth during the Flight of the Noldor hundreds of years earlier, Finrod was allowed to be released from the [[Halls of Mandos]] and to [[Elven life cycle#Death and reincarnation|re-embody]] in Valinor after only a short time.

It is possible he and his brother [[Angrod]] were first called ''[[Aráto]]'', and later differentiated adding ''find-'', referred to the golden hair derived from [[Indis]]. This name was [[Telerin]] in form where the adjectival element (\"aráto\" in this case) was typically placed second while in [[Quenya]] it would have preceded. Thus, the more natural Quenya form would have been '''''Artafindë'''''.<ref name=\"Finwe\">{{PM|Finwe}}</ref>{{rp|346–347}}\n\n===Felagund===\n'''''Felagund''''' was an [[epessë]] given to him by the [[Dwarves]] that expanded the caves of Nargothrond, and meant \"Hewer of Caves\". It is not Sindarin, but rather [[Sindarinized]] [[Khuzdul]], from '''''Felakgundu'''''. The name was Eldarized by other as '''''Felagon''''' (in relation with Fin''gon'', Tur''gon'').<ref>{{PM|Felagund}}, p. 352</ref> \n\nWhile revising his [[Elvish]] languages in later years, [[Tolkien]] reinterpreted ''Felagund'' as \"den-dweller, brock, badger\", from [[Sindarin]] ''fela'', which was used for dens made by wild animals or temporary dwellings of wandering folks, unrelated to big carved caves. The west bank of Narog had many dens of badgers, some of them occupied by [[Petty-dwarves]]. It was thus probable that ''Felagund'' was actually given by the [[Sons of Fëanor]] as a mockery to Finrod, and transmitted by the Dwarves.<ref>{{NM|P3vii}}, p. 304</ref>\n\nAn early etymology for ''Felagund'' was \"Lord of Caves\" in [[Noldorin]], from ''[[fela]]'' (\"caverns\") + ''[[cunn]]'' (\"prince\").<ref>{{LR|P3}}, entries \"KUNDU\", \"PHELEG\"</ref>\n\n==Other names==\nHis [[Amilessë|mother-name]] was '''''[[Ingoldo]]''''', which was also the mother-name of his father Finarfin. It meant \"''the'' Ñoldo\", 'one-eminent of the kindred' which is in simpler words 'the wise'. It was a name used by his brothers and sister, who loved him.<ref name=\"Finwe\">{{PM|Finwe}}</ref>{{rp|346, 360}} \n\nFinrod was also called '''''[[Nóm]]''''' (\"Wisdom\") by [[Bëor]] and his [[House of Bëor|people]].<ref name=\"West\">{{S|West}}</ref> His other titles include \"the Faithful\", \"the Friend of Men\", \"[[King of Nargothrond]]\", \"[[Lord of Nargothrond]]\".<ref>{{S|Index}}, entry \"Finrod\"</ref><ref name=\":0\">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Appendix B]] \"The Tale of Years\".</ref>\n\nHe was often called by the Eldar '''''Edennil''''' or '''''Atandil''''', which means  \"Friend of Men\" in [[Sindarin]] and [[Quenya]] respectively.<ref>{{MR|P4k}}, p. 349 (cf. p. 306)</ref> A variant for ''Atandil'' was ''Firindil''.<ref>{{VT|41c}}, p. 14</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| MIR |y|~|~|~|~|~|~| FIN |y| IND | | | | | | | | OLW | | | | | | | |MIR=[[Míriel]]<br /><small>''d. {{YT|1170}}''</small>|FIN=[[Finwë]]<br /><small>''d. {{YT|1495}}''</small>|IND=[[Indis]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|OLW=[[Olwë]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | |!| | | |,|-|-|-|v|-|^|-|v|-|-|-|.| | | |,|-|^|-|.| | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | FEA | | FDS | | FNG | | IRM | | FRF |y| EAW | | SON | | | | | |FEA=[[Fëanor]]<br /><small>''{{YT|1169}} - {{YT|1497|n}}''</small>|FDS=[[Findis]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|FNG=[[Fingolfin]]<br /><small>''{{YT|1190}} - {{FA|456}}''</small>|IRM=[[Írimë]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|FRF=[[Finarfin]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT|1230}}''</small>|EAW=[[Eärwen]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|SON=''unknown sons''}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | |,|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|^|-|-|-|v|-|-|.| | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | FRD | | ANG |y| ELD | | AEG | | GAL |y| CEL | |FRD='''FINROD'''<br /><small>''{{YT|1300}} - {{FA|465}}''</small>|ANG=[[Angrod]]<br /><small>''d. {{FA|455}}''</small>|AEG=[[Aegnor]]<br /><small>''d. {{FA|455}}''</small>|GAL=[[Galadriel]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT|1362}}''</small>|ELD=[[Eldalótë]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|CEL=[[Celeborn]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | ORO | | | | | | ELR |y| CLB | | | |ORO=[[Orodreth]]<br /><small>''d. {{FA|495}}''</small>|CLB=[[Celebrían]]<br /><small>''b. {{SA}}''</small>|ELR=[[Elrond]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA|532}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |,|-|^|-|.| | | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|.| | |}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | FIL | | GIL | | ELL | | ELO | | ARW | |GIL=[[Gil-galad]]<br /><small>''d. {{SA|3441}}''</small>|FIL=[[Finduilas]]<sup>[[Finduilas#Notes|NB]]</sup><br /><small>''{{FA|272}} - {{FA|495|n}}''</small>|ELL=[[Elladan]]<br /><small>''b. {{TA|130}}''</small>|ELO=[[Elrohir]]<br /><small>''b. {{TA|130}}''</small>|ARW=[[Arwen]]<br /><small>''{{TA|241}} - {{FoA|121}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn earlier versions of the Middle-earth myths, and when ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' was published, the name '''Finrod''' was given to the character later known as [[Finarfin]]. Finrod Felagund was then named '''[[Inglor Felagund]]'''. However, that changed in later drafts, and the character who had the name [[Gildor Inglorion]], in ''The Lord of the Rings'', was unrelated to Finrod despite having a name that means Gildor son of Inglor. Finrod was childless and unmarried during the events of ''The Silmarillion'' because his lover, Amarië, remained in Valinor.<ref>{{S|15}}</ref> \n\nIn one note, while defining the term ''[[vanwa]]'', [[Tolkien]] considered that Felagund, like [[Míriel]], chose ''not'' to return to life because of a special will of their own.<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}</ref>{{rp|143}}\n\nIn the published ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', Orodreth is Finrod's brother: this was an editorial decision by [[Christopher Tolkien]] and an admitted mistake. Orodreth was actually the son of Angrod and thus Finrod's nephew.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Rings of Power (TV series) - Finrod.jpg|thumb|[[Will Fletcher]] as Finrod in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'']]\n\n===Television===\n'''2022: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'', Season One:'''\n:'''Episode 1: ''[[A Shadow of the Past]]'':''' [[Galadriel]] recalls a memory of her brother during her childhood at the time of the [[Years of the Trees]]. In the memory, after some Elf children bully her and sink her paper swan ship, she attempts to attack one of them. However, Finrod (portrayed by [[Will Fletcher]]) shows up just in time to prevent her from doing any harm.\n:Not long after, Finrod is seen talking to Galadriel beneath a tree, where it is revealed that Galadriel had made the ship just as Finrod had taught her. Finrod then asks her if she knows why ships float while stones cannot, and tells her, after a moment of silence, that stones look downwards towards the irresistible darkness of water while ships look upwards towards the light, fighting against the darkness of water, whispering on things it would not know. Galadriel questions Finrod, saying that \"light in the sky\" is sometimes reflected brightly on the surface of water and that it is hard to know which light to follow.  Upon thinking, Finrod whispers to her: \"''Sometimes we cannot know until we have touched the darkness''\". To this, Galadriel ponders that it sounds simple and Finrod tells her that many things are, but she must decide them for herself as he will not always be there to help.\n:Not elaborating on this further, Finrod stands up and tells her that their parents are waiting for them, before walking over a hill to reveal the [[Two Trees]]. This exchange, as well as the philosophy which Finrod imparts to Galadriel in it were created for the series because none of this dialogue nor the attitudes it attributes to Finrod are found within any Tolkien's writings.  Later in Galadriel's recollections, Finrod is seen in a battle shouting phrases in [[Quenya]]: \"''Valaron kalanen''\" (\"By the [[Light of Valinor|light]] of the [[Valar]]!\") and \"''Firuvantë''\" (\"[[Orcs|They]] will die!\"). Galadriel mentions that he vowed to destroy [[Sauron]], [[Morgoth|Morgoth's]] sorcerer and lieutenant. Yet Sauron found and defeated Finrod first, marking his corpse with a red symbol, which not even the wisest [[Elves]] could decipher, causing Galadriel to take up her brother's vow and dagger for herself.\n:None of Galadriel's other brothers are mentioned in the series, and although no specific date is given, the timing and manner of Finrod's death are changed from what is recorded in Tolkien's writings.  Finrod is said to have not died until after Morgoth's defeat, meaning that, in Amazon's continuity, Finrod survives the entirety of the First Age into the Second instead of having died in approximately year 465 of the First Age saving Beren.\n:The series does allude to Finrod being killed by wolves with the claw marks on his body, though Galadriel's monologue establishes that it was Sauron who slew him with no mention of werewolves or Beren. This would have been at a a time long after Beren's quest for a Silmaril led him to Nargothrond, seeking Finrod's aid.\n:'''Episode 8: ''[[Alloyed]]'':'''\n:This Episode features a bizarre scene in which [[Halbrand]] enters [[Galadriel|Galadriel's]] mind beside the [[Glanduin]] in Eregion to try to prove to her that he truly desired to redeem himself and heal [[Middle-earth]] of evil, by appearing in the guise of Finrod as she remembered him. Nevertheless, Galadriel refuses to believe that he is redeemable and Halbrand is thrust from her mind and flees [[Eregion]] to the [[Mordor|Southlands]]\n:[[Amazon Studios]]'s rights to Finrod's character were limited to his mention in the ''[[Appendices]]'', so the series made significant changes and additions to his story, including showing him taking [[Oath of Fëanor|an oath against Morgoth]] before he left Valinor, and his death at the hands of Sauron, which inspires Galadriel's revenge. It is worth noting that Finrod's death saving Beren is mentioned in ''Appendix B: The Tale of Years'', and so Amazon could have used that material, but still opted to change it to have him dying in pursuit of Sauron.<ref name=\":0\" />  Finrod's original personality was particularly wise, very respectful and reverent towards the Valar, rather than as a rebel who advises people to \"touch the darkness\".\n\n{{references|notes}}\n\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n|race=noldor\n|house=[[House of Finarfin]]<small><br/>Cadet branch of the [[House of Finwë]]</small>\n|born={{YT|1300}}\n|died={{FA|465}}\n}}\n{{seq\n|pvac=None\n|prev=Title established\n|list=1st [[King of Nargothrond]]\n|dates={{FA|102}} – {{FA|465|n}}\n|next=[[Orodreth]]\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n\n[[Category:Calaquendi]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:House of Finarfin]]\n[[Category:Noldor]]\n[[Category:Noldorin names]]\n[[Category:Rulers in Beleriand]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n[[de:Finrod]]\n[[fi:Finrod]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/elfes/noldor/finrod]]"}}}
