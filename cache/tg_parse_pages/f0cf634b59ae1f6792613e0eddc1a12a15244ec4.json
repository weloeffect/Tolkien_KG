Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s fiction; he read ''[[The Hobbit]]'' after leaving the Royal Air Force in [[1945]], and since ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' came out, he read all Tolkien's books once a year. Lee also had the experience of actually meeting Tolkien in person (making him the only individual involved in the film trilogies to do so) while visiting [[The Eagle and Child]] during the 1950s:\n\n{{Blockquote|We were sitting there talking and drinking beer, and someone said, \"Oh, look who walked in.\" It was Professor Tolkien, and I nearly fell off my chair.

And he was a genius, a man of incredible intellectual knowledge. He knew somebody in our group. He (the man in the group) said \"Oh Professor, Professor...\" And he came over. And each one of us, well I knelt of course, each one of us said \"how do you do?\" And I just said \"Ho.. How..

He was nonetheless very enthusiastic about taking part. Though he doesn't remember what he read during the casting process, he was later told Jackson specifically wanted him for the role of Saruman beforehand.<ref name=TORNinterview>{{Webcite|articleurl=https://www.theonering.net/torwp/2001/05/13/27566-interviews-christopher-lee-ian-mckellen-john-rhys-davies/|articlename=Interviews: Christopher Lee, Ian McKellen, John Rhys-Davies|author=Calisuri|dated=13 May 2001|website=TORN}}</ref> Lee had never been in a movie with the actual Gandalf, [[Ian McKellen|Sir Ian McKellen]], but the two quickly became friends, being the oldest actors on the set (though Lee was 17 years older). When McKellen was cast as Gandalf, Lee was 78 years old and McKellen was 61.\n\nLee shot most of his scenes in [[Wellington]], in the main studio, but also shot one scene in Wellington's national park. He visited [[New Zealand]] four times, the longest time being ten weeks. He later did some post-synching in London.{{citation needed}}\n\nWhile jet-lagged, Lee broke his hand smashing it against a wall.{{citation needed}} Several shots of him in the finished films show him carefully hiding this bandaged left hand.\n\n===Other projects===\nKnown for his booming voice, Christopher Lee has sung operas, and performed with the [[Tolkien Ensemble]] on their CDs ''[[At Dawn in Rivendell]]'' and ''[[Leaving Rivendell]]''. He sang the role of [[Treebeard]], as well as reciting numerous other poems. Beyond purely Tolkien-based music, he also worked with metal band ''Rhapsody of Fire'', playing a ''Wizard-king'' character in several albums, possibly inspired by his role as Saruman.<ref>{{Cite web|articleurl=https://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Christopher_Lee/3706|articlename=Christopher Lee|website=[https://www.metal-archives.com Encyclopaedia Metallum ]|accessed=31 July 2025}}</ref>\n\nLee has recounted his life and his connections with Tolkien's work in the foreword to [[Chris Smith]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Weapons and Warfare]]'', and in chapter 74, titled \"Spellbinder\", of his autobiography, ''Lord of Misrule''.\n\nLee agreed to reprise his role as Saruman for [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]] on the condition that, due to his age, he did not have to fly out to New Zealand to be filmed. As a result all of his close-up his scenes as Saruman in this film where shot in London and not in New Zealand, while his stunt scenes where shot in New Zealand with a body double.<ref>{{webcite|author=Michelle Jaworski|articleurl=https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/christopher-lee-the-hobbit-last-scene-filming/|articlename=This is what Christopher Lee's final 'Hobbit' scene looked like on set|dated=20 March 2020|website=[https://www.dailydot.com Daily Dot]|accessed=16 October 2022}}</ref>\n\n==Roles==\n*[[2024]] - ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim]]'' - Saruman (archival audio)\n*[[2014]] - ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'' - Saruman\n*2014 - ''[[Lego The Hobbit: The Video Game]]'' - Narrator / Saruman\n*[[2012]] - ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey ]]'' - Saruman\n*[[2007]] - [[The Children of Húrin (audiobook)|''The Children of Húrin'' (audiobook)]] - Narrator\n*[[2006]] - ''[[Complete Songs and Poems]]'' - Gandalf / [[Bilbo]] / Treebeard\n*[[2005]] - ''[[Leaving Rivendell]]'' - Gandalf\n*[[2004]] - ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'' - Saruman\n*2004 - ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age]]'' - Saruman\n*[[2003]] - ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' - Saruman (extended edition)\n*2003 - [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' (video game)]] - Saruman (archive footage)\n*2003 - ''[[Beyond the Movie: The Return of the King]]'' - Himself\n*2003 - ''[[At Dawn in Rivendell]]'' - [[Treebeard]] / [[Gandalf]]\n*2003 - ''[[J.R.R.

Nothing like it has ever existed, and probably never will.|Christopher Lee, foreword to ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Weapons and Warfare]]''}}\n{{Blockquote|It's just going to be...I'm trying to think of the right word - without making it sound like the usual fashionable superlative. I think it will create film history. I think it's going to have the biggest impact, on screen, of anything of the last 40 or 50 years|Christopher Lee, SFX Magazine June #65}}\n{{Blockquote|Saruman is number one. Saruman is, very definitely, the most brilliant, the most powerful, with the greatest intellect and the greatest knowledge. Gandalf...well he's number two. But Saruman's whole character becomes perverted and distorted and he lusts for power and gradually, as it very often does, the old famous quote 'power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely'.|Christopher Lee, Fox's [[Quest for the Ring]]}}\n{{Blockquote|I did meet him [Tolkien], very briefly, in the Fifties. It was in a pub that he used to go to in Oxford, called the Eagle and Child. I was there having a beer and I was completely overcome when he walked in. I had already started reading the books and thought, \"This man has created a unique form of literature - one of the great works of all time.\" While I was filming The Lord of the Rings, I thought about what he would have thought all the time, and hope he would have approved. I'm still an enormous fan - I read The Lord of the Rings every year.|[http://web.archive.org/web/20100925072809/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/christopher-lee-you-ask-the-questions-735506.html ''The Independent'', 11 February 2009]}}\n\n==Awards==\n*[[2002]] - '''[http://www.cinemaclips.com/PFCS.htm PFCS Award]''', Best Acting Ensemble, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''\n*[[2003]] - '''[http://ofcs.rottentomatoes.com/ OFCS Award]''', Best Ensemble, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''\n*2003 - '''PFCS Award''', Best Acting Ensemble, ''Peter Jackson's The Two Towers''\n\n==Bibliography, selected==\n*[[2003]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Weapons and Warfare]]'' \n**\"Foreword\"\n\n==External links==\n*'''[http://www.christopherleeweb.com/ Official website]'''\n*{{WP|Christopher Lee}}\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lee, Christopher}}\n[[Category:Actors and actresses]]\n[[Category:Narrators]]\n[[Category:Authors]]\n[[Category:British people]]\n[[Category:People by name]]\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings (film series) cast]]\n[[Category:The Hobbit (film series) cast]]\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim cast]]\n\n\n[[de:Christopher Lee]]\n[[fi:Christopher Lee]]"}}}
