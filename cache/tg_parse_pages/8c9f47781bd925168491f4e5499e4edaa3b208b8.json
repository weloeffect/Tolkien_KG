From their northernmost point the hills extended in a south-westerly direction. At the southern end was [[Fornost Erain]], the ancient city of the [[Dúnedain of Arnor|Dúnedain of the North]], and the northern terminus of the [[North-South Road]].<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn the early [[Second Age]] the Downs were occupied by [[Men]], as well as [[Weather Hills]] and the [[Lake Evendim]].<ref>{{PM|Atani}}</ref> In the year {{SA|600}} [[Vëantur]] first returned to [[Middle-earth]] from [[Númenor]].<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}</ref> Upon hearing that some of their distant kin had come, these [[Middle Men]] petitioned [[Gil-galad]] to meet the mariners. Twelve men came and rejoiced to meet the Númenóreans.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}, Note 3</ref>\n\nWhen the kingdom of [[Arnor]] was established in {{SA|3320}}<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref> the North Downs were incorporated into the realm.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref> When Arnor was divided in {{TA|861}}<ref name=\"TA\">{{App|TA}}</ref> the frontier between [[Arthedain]] and [[Rhudaur]] was the Weather Hills;<ref name=\"North\">{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain''</ref> this frontier may have extended along the eastern edge of the North Downs.\n\nWhen [[Angmar]] attacked Eriador in {{TA|1409}}, the new King [[Araphor]] repelled the enemy from [[Fornost Erain]] and the North Downs, with help from [[Cirdan]].<ref name=\"North\"/>\n\nIn {{TA|1974|n}} before the end of winter the [[Witch-king]] came down from Angmar and [[Fall of Fornost|captured Fornost]]. King [[Arvedui]] held out on the North Downs until he and some of his guard were driven to the north.<ref name=\"North\"/> Arriving late, [[Eärnur]] answered summons from Arvedui in {{TA|1975|n}} with a massive fleet from [[Gondor]] which disgorged a host marching eastwards. Unaware of his peril the Witch-king marched out to meet the [[Host of the West (Arnor)|mighty combined army]] of [[Elves]] and [[Men]] in the plains between the [[Hills of Evendim]] and the North Downs. In the ensuing [[Battle of Fornost]] the forces of Angmar were routed and then destroyed, although the Witch-king himself escaped.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the kingdom of Angmar had been defeated and destroyed, so too had Arthedain come to an end. Fornost was abandoned and became a place of fear, acquiring the name Deadmen's Dike.<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref> Other than visits by [[Rangers of the North]], the North Downs remained uninhabited for the remainder of the [[Third Age]]. In the [[Fourth Age]] though men may have returned to the North Downs; most likely [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] visited Fornost when he came north to dwell by Lake Evendim for awhile in {{FoA|15}}.<ref>{{App|Later}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - North Downs map.jpg|thumb|Map of the North Downs from ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''.]]\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The North Downs is one of the original regions of the game.
