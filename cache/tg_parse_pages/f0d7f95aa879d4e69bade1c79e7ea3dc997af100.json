It sits on the east bank of the Hayk Sarzain ([[Languages in Middle-earth Role Playing#Tazinain|Ta.]] \"Swollen-waters in the Earth-sands\"), a deep lake formed by the Maudar river. As the most powerful city in the region, its ruler, the Tarb, long held dominion over six of the seven cities of Sîrayn, with only the distant seaport of [[Tûl Harar]] remaining independent.\n\nA census in {{TA|1622}} recorded over 17,000 residents within the city proper, with another 6,000 to 10,000 living in the surrounding province. The population included a mix of Sirani citizens, Ayten nomads, and foreign merchants.<ref name=\"history\">{{ICE|3111}}, pp. 36-39</ref>\n\n==History==\nTûl Isra was originally founded in the early [[Second Age]]. Its location was strategic, situated where the ''Yûl Isra'' trade route branched off from the Camel Road near the confluence of the river Siresha and the Maudar River, leading south to the [[Yellow Mountains]]. The original city stood northwest of the Hayk Sarzain until its destruction during in {{SA|1933}} by the [[Fifth of the Nazgûl|Storm King]]'s armies.\n\nLater in the Second Age, a village named Mumett was established on the eastern shore of the lake. In {{TA|83}}, members of Clan Másra refounded Tûl Isra just south of Mumett. This new location featured a defensible bluff that augmented the city's twenty-foot high walls. Stone for the reconstruction was quarried from the nearby [[Sîrayn#Isra|Brû Isra]] or salvaged from ancient ruins.\n\nOver the centuries, the city outgrew its initial boundaries. The administrative centre was relocated to a new, expansive plaza featuring a palace, and the city expanded southward with new outer walls.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nBazaud Izain and his Bulgan clan were secuded by the Storm King in {{TA|1375}}, and in {{TA|1380}} took control of the court. After [[Tartas Izain]] was appointed Taraskon in {{TA|1385}}, he established a temple to the [[Sauron|Silent One]] by {{TA|1397}}. Driven off in {{TA|1436}}, he became Taraskon again from {{TA|1629}} until {{TA|1641}}, when the Bulgan clan falls.<ref>{{ICE|8205}}, pp. 5-6</ref><ref>{{ICE|8205}}, p. 15</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nBy {{TA|1630}}, Tûl Isra was divided into several distinct sections:\n\n===The Inner City===\nThe ''Hask Katarn'' ([[Languages in Middle-earth Role Playing#Tazinain|Ta.]] \"Heart of the City\") contained the oldest and most affluent districts. It was characterized by broad avenues lined with fine shops, spacious residences, and ornately carved temples built primarily of marble. The architecture featured abstract curvilinear designs on exteriors and geometric mosaics on interiors. The palace of the Tarb and administrative buildings were located here.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe city also hosted various temples. The Temple of the [[Sauron|Silent One]] was an unadorned stone edifice with black wooden doors, avoided by most citizens due to its ominous atmosphere. In contrast, the Tayee Temple was filled with frescoes and music. The Temple of the True Flame featured gold-sheathed domes, while the Temple of Saubaiz was adorned with grotesque figures and the depiction of an eight-eyed squid-like monster.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n===The Outer City===\nThe outer districts were less opulent, constructed primarily of brick rather than stone. It is here that the Tayee school was located, which rivaled the libraries of [[Minas Tirith]] and [[Annúminas]]. The Outer City also housed the Tár Ribausk ([[Languages in Middle-earth Role Playing#Tazinain|Ta.]] \"Wizard's Tower\"), the residence of Court Mage Kasair.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n===The Ruins===\nThe eastern edge of the city remained in ruins, the result of the magical fires unleashed by the sorcerers of [[Charnesra]] in {{TA|1457}}.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n===The Outer City Market===\nLocated outside the city gates to the north were the caravan grounds. They were frequented by Haradan traders, Dwarves from the Yellow Mountains, and Elves from the southern archipelago.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Middle-earth Role Playing locations]]"}}}
