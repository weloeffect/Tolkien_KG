[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] did not complete this tale and it is only given in different outlines.\n\nIt was started because men, [[Ilkorin]] [[elves]] and faithful [[dwarves]] rebelled against the Temple of [[Melko]]. On the other side, Melko's agent [[Fankil]] led an army of [[men]], [[Goblins]] and evil dwarves to destroy the rebel at the temple.\n\nThe battle was very catastrophic. Though no one really won. Repenting men (Lintanoi), Ilkorin and dwarves all left to the west. The Goblins retreated to the Wild woods in the north-east. And the evil men (Asrabi) stayed east or went south.<ref>{{LT1|X}}, pp. 236-7</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Conflicts in The Book of Lost Tales]]"}}}
