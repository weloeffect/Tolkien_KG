Tolkien]] sometime after June [[1969]].\n\nThis essay has never been published in its entirety, although parts of it were published in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', and the remaining parts were published in the periodical ''[[Vinyar Tengwar]]'', issue number [[Vinyar Tengwar 42|42]] in [[2001]]. The Vinyar Tengwar article was based on a version intended for publication by [[Christopher Tolkien]] in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'' but was not included due to space constraints, although it is mentioned in the book.\n\nAccording to Christopher Tolkien, the essay's germ was a letter by [[Paul Bibire]] to Tolkien on [[23 June]], [[1969]] inquiring whether the river [[Glanduin]] is the same as that of the [[Swanfleet]]. Tolkien replied on [[30 June]] (in the letter ''[[Letter to Paul Bibire]]''), stating that the [[Swanfleet]] is the same river as the Glanduin, although the former is applied to the upper course of the river. It is from the answer of this query that Tolkien decided to embark on a comprehensive essay of not only the [[Rivers of Gondor]], but also of the [[Warning beacons of Gondor|Beacon-hills of Gondor]], as mentioned in ''[[The Return of the King]]''.\n\nHowever, like many of his late works, Tolkien never got to finish the essay, abandoning it while in the middle of the discussion of the beacon-hill [[Halifirien]]. However, based on what can be gleaned from this, it seems it is at this point that Tolkien decided to introduce the idea of having the tomb of [[Elendil]] in Halifirien, which became an essential element in the work ''[[Cirion and Eorl]]''. Therefore from Paul Bibire's query arose the history of Halifirien and Elendil's tomb.\n\nThe essay is likewise notable for presenting a discussion of the [[Eldarin numerals]].\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor}}\n[[Category:The Nature of Middle-earth chapters]]\n[[Category:Manuscripts by J.R.R.
