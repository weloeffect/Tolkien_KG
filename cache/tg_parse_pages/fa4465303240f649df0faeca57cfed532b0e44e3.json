It grew along tropical freshwater. Its oily orange-edged leaves cause painful blisters.<ref>{{ICE|2026}}, p. 129</ref>\n\n:'''''Red Willow''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''Cardathar'', [[Quenya|Q.]] ''Carnitasar'') was a small willow growing in wetlands. At first its leaves are silvery green like other willows, but over the summer they turn rose and by autumn scarlet. They can be distilled in a cure for fever, or used in a balm named “cooling foam”.<ref>{{ICE|2026}}, p. 130</ref>\n\n==External links==\n*{{WP|Willow}}\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Trees]]"}}}
