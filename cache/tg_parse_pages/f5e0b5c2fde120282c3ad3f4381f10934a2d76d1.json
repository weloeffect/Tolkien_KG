The House was founded by [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]] after the [[War of the Ring]], who was the Heir of Elendil, and took the throne under the name Elessar.\n\n== History ==\nDuring the War of the Ring, [[Peregrin Took]], a companion of Aragorn's in the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], became a member of the elite Citadel Guard at [[Minas Tirith]], capital of Gondor. When Aragorn entered the city, Peregrin persisted in crudely referring to Aragorn by the nickname he had garnered as a Ranger of the North: \"Strider\", even in front of foreign dignitaries such as King [[Éomer]] of [[Rohan]]. Aragorn was amused and decided that the name of the lineage he founded would be \"Telcontar\", which means \"Strider\" in Quenya. Aragorn then took the royal name \"Elessar\".<ref name=Houses>{{RK|Houses}}, p. 863</ref>\n\nWith Queen [[Arwen]], King Elessar Telcontar reigned for 120 years, before finally surrendering his life. This long reign is attributed to Elessar's descent from the Men of [[Númenor]], who are blessed with long life (he was 87 when he took the throne). He rebuilt the old capital [[Annúminas]] in Arnor and later ruled from this northern capital, although the old capital Minas Tirith was still of great political importance. Elessar had one known son, [[Eldarion]], and an unspecified number of daughters. \n\nAfter Aragorn's death in {{FoA|120}},<ref name=\"Tale\">{{App|Tale}}</ref> his son [[Eldarion]] took up the High Kingship.<ref name=\"Tale\"/> One hundred years into his reign, he encountered a [[The New Shadow|new threat]], known only as the \"[[Dark Tree]]\".<ref>{{PM|Shadow}}</ref>\n\nOf Eldarion, it was foretold that he should rule a great realm, and that it should endure for a hundred generations of [[Men]] after him, that is until a new age brought in again new things; and from him should come the kings of many realms in long days after. But if this foretelling spoke truly, none now can say, for [[Gondor]] and [[Arnor]] are no more; and even the chronicles of the House of Telcontar and all their deeds and glory are lost.<ref name=\"Third\">{{PM|Third}}, text of manuscript T4 events after the end of the Third Age in the year 3021</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''Telcontar'' (pron. {{IPA|[telˈkontar]}}) was a translation into [[Quenya]] of Aragorn's common nickname in the north, \"[[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]]\".<ref name=Houses/>\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | ARA |y| ARW |ARA='''[[Aragorn|Elessar]]'''<br/><small>''{{TA|2931}} - {{FoA|120}}''</small>|ARW=[[Arwen]]<br/><small>''{{TA|241}} - {{FoA|121}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree | |,|-|^|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree | ELD | | SDS | ELD='''[[Eldarion]]'''<br/><small>''{{FoA|1}} - c. {{FoA|220}}''</small>|SDS=''several daughters''}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n{{references|notes}}\n[[Category:House of Telcontar| ]]\n[[Category:Mannish noble houses|Telcontar]]"}}}
