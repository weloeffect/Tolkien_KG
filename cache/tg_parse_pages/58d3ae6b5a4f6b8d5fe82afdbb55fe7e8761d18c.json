The works are based loosely on characters from the [[Old Norse|Norse]] sagas and the Nibelungenlied. The four dramas are often referred to as the ''Ring Cycle'', \"Wagner's Ring\", or simply ''The Ring''.\n\n==''The Lord of the Rings'' and the ''Ring Cycle''==\n\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' appears to borrow some elements from ''Der Ring des Nibelungen''; Tolkien even started working a translation of ''[[Die Walküre]]'' (the second of the four operas that comprise the ''Ring Cycle''), together with [[C.S. Lewis]].\n\nHowever, Tolkien himself denied that he had been inspired by Wagner's work, saying that \"Both rings were round, and there the resemblance ceases.\"<ref>{{l|229}}</ref> Some similarities arise because Tolkien and Wagner both drew upon the same source material for inspiration, including the ''[[Völsungasaga]]'' and the ''[[Poetic Edda]]''. However, several researchers posit that both authors draw upon many of the same sources but Tolkien was indebted to some of the original developments, insights and artistic uses made of those in Wagner, such as the ring giving to its owner mastery of the world and its corrupting influence upon the minds and wills of its possessors.<ref>Edward R.
