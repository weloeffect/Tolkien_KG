It flowed through [[Imloth Melui]] and divided Upper [[Lebennin]] and [[Lossarnach]]. The Erui was the domain of the brooding River-maid known as the Lone Lady, one of the Five Sisters, though she and her sisters were widely considered a myth by the end of the [[Third Age]]. The Lone Lady had long been detached and troubled due to the blood spilled in her waters during the [[Kin-strife]], and the invasion by [[Haradrim]] during the [[War of the Ring]] enraged her. She commanded the waters of the Erui to animate the armour of long-dead soldiers of Gondor to drive away any who approached the [[Crossings of Erui|Crossings]]. She was calmed by her sisters, but not before raising the armour of [[Castamir]] himself from the riverbed.\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Gondor]]\n[[Category:Rivers]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[de:Erui]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/eaux/gondor/erui]]\n[[fi:Erui]]"}}}
