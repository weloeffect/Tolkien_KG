The phrase took on a cult following, often associated with the hippie culture, and appeared written on walls, buttons, shirts, et cetera.\n\nThe term first became popular because of an increase in the availability and number of readers of the novel following release of the first paperback edition, which, up until that point, had been subject to rather mixed reviews. While no longer as pervasive as it once was, the term continues to appear regularly in newspaper articles and popular culture related to Tolkien's stories.\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Fandom]]"}}}
