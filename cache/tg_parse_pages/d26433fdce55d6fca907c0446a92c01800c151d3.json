He married [[Esmeralda Took]], and had one child, [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Meriadoc]],<ref name=\"App\" /> who joined the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Company of the Ring]].

[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] noted that the names of the Bucklanders had a vaguely [[Celtic]] style.<ref name=\"Translation\">{{App|Translation}}, p. 1135</ref>\n\nIn an earlier version of the family tree for the [[Brandybucks]], the name of [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]]'s father was '''''Caradoc'''''.<ref>{{PM|Trees}}, Brandybuck of Buckland, BR 5</ref> Caradoc is a [[Celtic]] name, which means \"kind\" or \"amiable\".<ref name=\"Allan\">{{HM|IE}}, \"Giving of Names\", p. 204</ref>\n\nIn using this name, J.R.R. Tolkien may have been inspired by how in about 1130 AD, a [[Wikipedia:Caradoc of Llancarfan|Caradoc of Llancarfan]] wrote about the life of St. Gildas, the first known text that associated [[King Arthur]] with [[Wikipedia:Glastonbury|Glastonbury]]. A character called Caradoc is the hero in the ''Livre de Caradoc'', which is part of the First Continuation of [[Wikipedia:Chrétien de Troyes|Chretien de Troyes']] ''[[Wikipedia:Perceval, the Story of the Grail|Perceval]]'' from about 1200 AD.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 422</ref>\n\nCaradoc is the name of different characters in Arthurian romance. A ''Caradoc Brecbras'' was apparently a sixth century British ruler with lands in Britain and Brittany. ''Saradoc des Sept Fontaines'' is the name of one of the Knights of the Round Table listed in the 1501 edition of the romance of ''Giron le Courtois''.<ref name=\"Allan\" />\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Saradoc Brandybuck in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Saradoc Brandybuck.jpg|Saradoc Brandybuck in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Saradoc Brandybuck can be found ouside [[Brandy Hall]] in [[Buckland]].
