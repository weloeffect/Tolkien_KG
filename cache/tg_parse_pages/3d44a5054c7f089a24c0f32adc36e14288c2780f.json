This area contained, among other features, the [[Weather Hills]] and [[Weathertop]]. Roads were considerably worse there than in [[the Shire]], and no one dwelt there anymore by the end of the [[Third Age]]. There were many abandoned castles of [[Rhudaur]] in the hilly region, which gave it a wicked look.<ref name=\"Mutton\">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Hobbit]]'', \"[[Roast Mutton]]\" (Second edition)</ref>\n\n==Lone-lands and Eriador==\nIt is a subject of some debate whether the Lone-lands and Eriador are one and the same. Etymologies given for ''Eriador'' certainly suggest such a thing.<ref name=\"vt42\">Fredrik Ström, [[Carl F.

Its boundaries are [[The Forsaken Inn]] in the far west and the [[Last Bridge]] at the far east. The game goes around the pre-existing mention of the region being uninhabited by making its people, the Eglain (Sindarin for \"Foresaken\"), shun existing society and avoid attention by travelers.\n\n{{references}}\n{{companyroute}}\n[[Category:Regions]]\n[[Category:Eriador]]\n[[de:Leere Lande]]\n[[fi:Yksinäiset maat]]"}}}
