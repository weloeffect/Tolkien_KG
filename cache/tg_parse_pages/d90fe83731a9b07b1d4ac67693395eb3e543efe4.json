So the Valar and Eldar - incited by [[Ainairos]] and led by [[Vána]] and [[Irmo|Lórien]], while [[Manwë]], [[Varda]], [[Ulmo]], as well as [[Yavanna]] and her son [[Oromë]] were against it - started working together on the hiding of Valinor, losing their chance to gain full glory by fighting Melko. All the ways to Valinor were blocked, with the [[Solosimpi]] convincing [[Aulë]] and [[Tulkas]] to destroy [[Helkaraksë]] and [[Ossë]] to create the [[Magic Isles]].\n\nSeeing this, Manwë was worried, and spoke honestly with Lórien and Oromë, but asked only for some corrections. So Lórien created a long way for Mannish children. Oromë made a bridge from the hair of Vána, his wife, for the Valar, called Rainbow by Men and ''[[Ilweran]]'' \"Bridge of Heaven\" by Elves. Finally, [[Mandos]] and [[Fui]] created the short ways of death, separate for elves and men.\n\nVairë started a separate story titled ''The Haven of the Sun'': the [[Moon]] travelled from the west to the east under the land with the help of a spell of Ulmo. However, the [[Sun]] could not do it due to the loss of light. Instead, Urwendi travelled with the Sun through the [[Outer Dark]] passing through the [[Door of Night]] and returning through the [[Gates of Morn]] with a word she, and only she, received from Manwë.\n\n''The weaving of Days, Months and Years'': [[Danuin]] (Day), [[Ranuin]] (Month), and [[Fanuin]] (Year) - the sons of [[Aluin]], Time, the oldest of [[Ainur]], who stayed outside of the world - appeared in Valinor and made invisible ropes to bind, respectively, the Sun, the Moon, and both the Sun and the Moon. The ropes made the movement of the Sun and Moon regular, and they gave the ropes to Manwë Súlimo. The Valar were concerned that time is measured and everything will reach its end.\n\nA final prophecy said that Melko will find the way to turn [[Ilinsor]] and [[Urwendi]] against each other and make them disappear behind the gates, but [[Fionwë|Fionwë Úrion]] (the son of Manwë), who loves Urwendi, will defeat him.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hiding of Valinor}}"}}}
