Largo was invented by [[Amazon Studios]] for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'', where he was portrayed by [[Dylan Smith]].<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9788618/fullcredits|articlename=Full Cast & Crew|dated=|website=IMDB|accessed=31 July 2022}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nLargo Brandyfoot was born during the latter half of the [[Second Age]]. He married [[Rose Brandyfoot]].\n\nAfter Largo lost his wife, he \"''felt like the wheels broke out from under''\" him. It was not until he first saw [[Marigold Brandyfoot|Marigold]] within the clearing of the [[Norfield Glen]], that he was able to move on from his grief. They had two children together: [[Elanor Brandyfoot|Elanor]] and [[Dilly Brandyfoot|Dilly]].\n\nWhile attempting to aid the other Harfoots in the preparation for the upcoming Harvest Festival, a rope snapped and Largo collapsed down to the ground, breaking his left ankle, forcing him to use a walking stick. Marigold grew afraid that the caravan would be forced to leave then behind on the migration due to the wound. Despite this, Largo attempted to assure her that he would remain in the front of the caravan.\n\nLater, When [[The Stranger]] accidentally interrupted [[Sadoc Burrows|Sadoc's]] remembrance speech and Elanor's rule breaking was made known, the Brandyfoots were forced to follow at the back of the caravan during the migration, dooming them to the very real possibility of being left behind.\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | ROS |~| LAR |y| MAR | | | | |ROS=[[Rose Brandyfoot]]<br/><small>''b. {{SA}}-unknown''</small>|LAR='''LARGO BRANDYFOOT'''<br/><small>''b. {{SA}}''</small>|MAR=[[Marigold Brandyfoot]]<br/><small>''b. {{SA}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | |,|-|^|-|.| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | ELA | | DIL | | | | |ELA=[[Elanor Brandyfoot]]<br/><small>''b. {{SA}}''</small>|DIL=[[Dilly Brandyfoot]]<br/><small>''b. {{SA}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Hobbits from adaptations]]\n\n[[fi:Largo Brandyfoot (televisiosarjan hahmo)]]"}}}
