Descended from all [[Edain#The Three Houses|Three Houses]] of the [[Edain]], he was the first known person to reach [[Aman]] in the [[First Age]] after the [[Noldor]] went into [[Exile of the Noldor|exile]]. He was crucial in the [[War of Wrath]] and the patriarch of the line of the [[Kings of Númenor]] through his son [[Elros]]. \n\n==History==\n[[File:Šárka Škorpíková - Travelling South.jpg|thumb|left|''Travelling South'' by [[:Category:Images by Šárka Škorpíková|Šárka Škorpíková]]]]\nThe son of [[Tuor]] and [[Idril]], daughter of King [[Turgon]], Eärendil was raised as a child in [[Gondolin]]. Eärendil was seven years old when [[Fall of Gondolin|Gondolin fell]], and narrowly escaped death at the hands of his kinsman [[Maeglin]] during the battle. He was borne out on the shoulders of Idril's house-carle [[Hendor]]. As they rested in [[Nan-tathren]], the waters of [[Ulmo]] awoke the [[sea-longing]] in both father and son.<ref>{{S|Tuor}}</ref>\n\nHe lived afterwards in [[Arvernien]] by the [[Havens of Sirion]]. Eärendil later became the leader of the people who lived there, and married [[Elwing]], daughter of [[Dior]], the son of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]]. They had two sons, [[Elrond]] and [[Elros]].\n\nWith the aid of [[Círdan]] the Shipwright, Eärendil built a ship, ''[[Vingilótë]]'' (or ''Vingilot''), and sailed around the seas west of Middle-earth for two purposes: to seek after Tuor and Idril who did not return, and to perhaps find Aman and so bring the message of Elves and Men to the Valar in the West before he died - resulting him leaving his wife behind in Arvernien. At this time Elwing had in her possession the [[Silmaril]] that Beren had wrested from [[Morgoth]]. News of this came to the remaining sons of [[Fëanor]], and they attacked the people living in Arvernien, killing most of them. But Elwing, rather than be captured, threw herself and the Silmaril into the sea. The Silmaril was not lost, however:\n[[File:Steamey - Eärendil and Elwing.jpg|thumb|left|''Eärendil and Elwing'' by [[:Category:Images by Steamey|Steamey]]]]\n{{blockquote|For [[Ulmo]] bore up Elwing out of the waves, and he gave her the likeness of a great white bird, and upon her breast there shone as a star the Silmaril, as she flew over the water to seek Eärendil her beloved. On a time of night Eärendil at the helm of his ship saw her come towards him, as a white cloud exceeding swift beneath the moon, as a star over the sea moving in strange courses, a pale flame on wings of storm. And it is sung that she fell from the air upon the timbers of Vingilot, in a swoon, nigh unto death for the urgency of her speed, and Eärendil took her to his bosom; but in the morning with marveling eyes he beheld his wife in her own form beside him with her hair upon his face, and she slept.|''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', \"[[Of the Voyage of Eärendil and the War of Wrath]]\"}}\n\nHearing of the tragedy that had befallen in Arvernien, Eärendil then sought after [[Valinor]], and he and Elwing found their way there at last. Eärendil thus became the first of all mortals to set foot in Valinor. Eärendil then went before the [[Valar]], and asked them to aid the Men and Elves in Middle-earth and fight against Morgoth; and the Valar accepted his plea.\n\nBecause Eärendil had undertaken this errand on behalf of Men and Elves, and not for his own sake, [[Manwë]] forbore to deal out the punishment of death that was due. Because both Eärendil and Elwing were descended from a union of Elves and Men, Manwë granted to them and their sons the gift to choose to which race they would be joined (a gift that was further passed to the children of Elrond, who became known as the [[Half-elven]]). Elwing chose to be one of the Elves. Eärendil would have rather been one of the Men; however, for the sake of his wife, he chose to be one of the Elves.\n\n{{blockquote|But when all was spoken, Manwë gave judgement, and he said: 'In this matter the power of doom is given to me. The peril that he ventured for love of the Two Kindreds shall not fall upon Eärendil, nor shall it fall upon Elwing his wife, who entered into peril for love of him; but they shall not walk again ever among Elves or Men in the Outer Lands. And this is my decree concerning them: to Eärendil and to Elwing, and to their sons, shall be given leave each to choose freely to which kindred their fates shall be joined, and under which kindred they shall be judged.'|''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', \"[[Of the Voyage of Eärendil and the War of Wrath]]\"}}\n\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Eärendil and the Battle of Eagles and Dragons.jpg|thumb|''Eärendil and the Battle of Eagles and Dragons'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nThe Valar, having listened to Eärendil's plea, went with a mighty host to Middle-earth and overthrew Morgoth, binding him with a chain forged by the smith [[Aulë]]. Eärendil took part in the battle. His ship Vingilótë was blessed by the Valar, filled with a shining white flame, and sent to the skies. He sailed at its helm with the Silmaril bound upon his brow. Alongside [[Thorondor]] and the [[Eagles]], he slew the great dragon [[Ancalagon]] the Black and cast his body down onto [[Thangorodrim]], the event which, along with the sheer devastation caused by the [[War of Wrath]], led to the Ruin of [[Beleriand]].\n\n==Legacy==\n{{seealso|Star of Eärendil}}\n[[File:Matěj Čadil - The Star of Earendil.jpg|thumb|left|''The Star of Earendil'' by [[Matěj Čadil]]]]\nEärendil lived in Valinor, and the gleaming of the Silmaril upon his brow could still be seen in the skies of the distant West as the bright Evening Star.<ref name=\"S24\">{{S|24}}</ref> Those who remained in Middle-earth called it '''Gil-Estel''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] \"Star of High Hope\").\n\nIn the [[Second Age]], the descendants of the [[Edain]] followed the [[Star of Eärendil]] to reach [[Elenna]]. When [[Númenor]] fell under the [[Shadow]], [[Tar-Atanamir]] mentioned Eärendil's fate to argue about [[immortality]] to the Messengers of the [[Valar]].

The earliest was ''[[Éalá Éarendel Engla Beorhtast]]'', which would set the foundations for ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' as Tolkien \"tried to find out\" what it was about.<ref>{{B|III}}, p. 71</ref> The other poems were ''[[The Bidding of the Minstrel]]'', ''[[The Shores of Faëry]]'' and ''[[The Happy Mariners]]'', all written between [[1914]]-[[1915]].<ref name=\"Earendel\">{{LT2|V}}</ref>{{rp|267–273}} The four poems tell in a lyric way about the coming of Eärendel to Valinor, the rising of his boat as the morning star and his everlasting travel in the edge of the world. \n\n''The Bidding of the Minstrel'' is associated with a noted page, which outlines the travels of Eärendel to the North, visiting Island, Iceland, magic lands and seeing [[Kôr]] from afar; then he goes South, travelling through the Mediterranean or Atlantic sea, full of strange creatures. Then he travels to the western lip of the world and sails upon the sky, never coming back. ''The Shores of Faëry'' has a short preface in prose, which, as in the former text, conceives Eärendel as an old man when travelling to the firmament.<ref name=\"Earendel\" />{{rp|261–262}}\n\n===The Book of Lost Tales===\n[[File:Mysilvergreen - Ecthelion and Earendil.jpg|thumb|''Ecthelion and Earendil'' by [[:Category:Images by Mysilvergreen|Mysilvergreen]]]]\nIn the earliest narrative of the legendarium in ''The Book of Lost Tales'', the birth of Eärendel is first prophesied of by [[Ulmo]] to [[Tuor]]: \"''...and of a surety a child shall come of thee than whom no man shall know more of the uttermost deeps, be it of the sea or of the firmament of heaven.''\"<ref name=\"Gondolin\">{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|155}} Years later, the wishes of the [[Valar]] were fulfilled when Eärendel was born from Tuor and [[Idril]] in [[Gondolin]]:\n\n{{blockquote|Now this babe was of greatest beauty; his skin of a shining white and his eyes of a blue surpassing that of the sky in southern lands — bluer than the sapphires of the raiment of [[Manwë]]; and the envy of [[Meglin]] was deep at his birth, but the joy of [[Turgon]] and all the people very great indeed.<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|165}}}}\n\nNow Eärendel was still of tender years when the [[Fall of Gondolin]] began. The red lights of the enemy appeared in the walls of his room, which made him cry, as his nurse [[Meleth (nurse)|Meleth]] had told him dark stories about [[Melko]]. His mother Idril came and arrayed him with a tiny coat of mail, which cheered him up greatly.<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|174}} When the battle had just begun at the northern part of the city, Meglin and his [[folk of the Mole]] came to the house of Tuor and seized Idril. Tuor and his [[folk of the Wing]] appeared there when Meglin was dragging Idril and Eärendel to the walls, as he wished to cast out the child while the mother saw it. Seeing that Tuor was coming, Meglin tried to stab Eärendel, but the child bit his hand and the coat turned the blade aside. After killing Meglin, Tuor gave Idril some of his men and left to battle.<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|177–178}}\n\nDuring the siege of Gondolin, Idril remained in the doors of her house, till she could wait no longer, so she sent most of her bodyguard down [[Idril's secret way|her secret tunnel]] with Eärendel, while she stayed there.<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|187}} Later, when the [[Exiles of Gondolin]] came out of the city to the plain, Tuor saw a group of men being chased by [[wolf-riders]]: \"''Lo! there is Eärendel my son; behold, his face shineth as a star in the waste...''\". About Eärendel were some men of the Wing, and he was being carried by [[Hendor]], a house-carle. By the order of Tuor, they stopped running and were saved from the Orcs. The child was happy of seeing his father, who took him upon his shoulders. Later, when reunited with his mother, Eärendel refused to be carried by her, as she was clearly tired, and asked for [[Salgant]], who was a friend of them in Gondolin. But as when he asked for [[Ecthelion]] and Gondolin, his parents explained they were all fallen.<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|190–191}} After a year of wanderings, the Exiles settled down in the [[Mouths of Sirion|mouth of Sirion]], and there Eärendel grew fair in the house of his father.<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|196–197}}\n\nTolkien never finished [[the Tale of Eärendel]], which is only given in dispersed outlines. It is practically impossible to summarise them in a coherent way.\n\n===Later versions===\nIn the first sketch of the ''Silmarillion'' ([[1926]]) intended to \"reboot\" the legendarium, Eärendel slew Ungoliant.<ref>{{SM|2}}</ref>\n\n''Earendel'' is also mentioned in [[The Notion Club Papers]], where Tolkien finally changed the name to ''Earendil'', and remained so.\n\n==Inspiration==\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Eärendil heraldic device (II).jpg|right|thumb|100px|One of the three heraldic devices [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] designed for Eärendil]]\nWhile ''Eärendil'' is a [[Quenya]] name inside the [[legendarium]], Tolkien created the name based on [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] ''éarendel''. He says that he was struck by the \"great beauty\" of the name as early as 1913, which he perceived as \"entirely coherent with the normal style of A-S, but euphonic to a peculiar degree in that pleasing but not 'delectable' language.\"<ref>{{L|297}}, p. 385</ref>\n\nTolkien was also aware of the name's Germanic cognates (Old Norse ''[[:Wikipedia:Aurvandill|Aurvandill]]'', Lombardic ''Auriwandalo''), and the question why the Anglo-Saxon one rather than the Lombardic or Proto-Germanic form should be taken up in the mythology is alluded to in ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]''.<ref>{{SD|Notion}}</ref> The [[Old Norse]] together with the Anglo-Saxon evidence point to an astronomical myth, the name referring to a star, or a group of stars, and the Anglo-Saxon in particular points to the Morning Star as the herald of the rising Sun (in ''Crist'' christianized to refer to John the Baptist).\n\nTolkien was particularly inspired by the lines in ''[[Wikipedia:Christ I|Christ]]'', which became the title of [[Éalá Éarendel Engla Beorhtast|his first poem about Eärendel]]:\n\n{{blockquote|éala éarendel engla beorhtast / ofer middangeard monnum sended<br>\n\"Hail Earendel, brightest of angels / sent over Middle-earth to men.\"}}\n\nThis first line is paralleled by [[Eönwë]] when Eärendil reaches Aman: \"''Hail Eärendil, of mariners most renowned, [...] Hail Eärendil, bearer of light before the Sun and Moon!''\".<ref name=\"S24\" /> It also inpires [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s exclamation in [[Shelob's Lair]], \"''[[Aiya Eärendil elenion ancalima!]]''\",<ref>{{TT|IV9}}</ref> which translates as \"Hail Eärendil, brightest of stars!\". Frodo's exclamation was in reference to the \"[[Phial of Galadriel|Star-glass]]\" he carried, which contained the light of [[Star of Eärendil|Eärendil's star]], the [[Silmaril]] he wore upon his brow.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Rings of Power (TV series) - Central wharf of Armenelos.jpg|thumb|The statue of Eärendil upon the central wharf of [[Armenelos]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]''.]]\n\n'''2022: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'':'''\n:'''September 8: ''[[Adar (episode)|Adar]]'':'''\n::The central wharf within the [[Armenelos|capital city]] of [[Númenor]] is towered over by a statue of '''Eärendil the Mariner''', the [[half-elven]] saviour of [[Middle-earth]] during the [[Elder Days|War of Wrath]] and the father of [[Elros|the first king]] of Númenor.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Gondolindrim]]\n[[Category:Half-elven]]\n[[Category:House of Fingolfin]]\n[[Category:House of Hador]]\n[[Category:Mariners]]\n[[Category:Noldor]]\n[[Category:Rulers in Beleriand]]\n[[Category:Second Age characters]]\n[[Category:Quenya names]]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Earendil}}\n[[de:Earendil der Seefahrer]]\n[[fi:Eärendil]]\n[[fr:encyclo:personnages:elfes:semi-elfes:earendil]]"}}}
