Tolkien]]'s works with respect to medieval literature. It was published as No. 29 in the ''[[Cormarë Series]]''.\n\n==From the publisher==\n\n{{blockquote|The nine articles of stimulating literary criticism collected in this volume view Tolkien's work from a variety of medieval perspectives: the device of entrelacement employed in Arthurian romances is used to throw light on the narrative design of The Lord of the Rings; the cultures of Middle-earth are described with the aid of medieval orality and literacy studies; the epic figure of the queen is recalled to reveal the significance of women in Tolkien's trilogy; the character of Éowyn is analyzed in terms of the epic warrior code and the romance chivalric ethos; the role of Elbereth is shown to correspond with the position of the Virgin Mary in the world of medieval believers; the nature of evil is explored through a comparison of Melkor to John Milton's Satan; allusions to medieval Icelandic sagas are detected in Tolkien's works for children; The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth is read in the light of The Battle of Maldon; and Tolkien's literary art is illuminated by way of his own critical essays on Beowulf and fairy-stories. Since all the contributors come from Poland, the phenomenon of Tolkien's prompt and enthusiastic Polish reception is briefly discussed in the introductory chapter.}}\n\n==Contents==\n\n* Introduction: Tolkien in Poland - A Medievalist Liaison\n** By: Barbara Kowalik\n* \"O, what a tangled web we weave\": ''The Lord of the Rings'' and the Interlacement Technique\n** By: Joanna Kokot\n* Orality and Literacy in Middle-earth\n** By: Bartłomiej Błaszkiewicz\n* Rohan and the Social Codes of Heroic Epic and Chivalric Romance\n** By: Justyna Brzezińska\n* Tolkien's Queen Women in ''The Lord of the Rings''\n** By: Maria Błaszkiewicz\n* Elbereth the Star-Queen Seen in the Light of Medieval Marian Devotion\n** By: Barbara Kowalik\n* The Fallen: Milton's Satan and Tolkien's Melkor\n** By: Katarzyna Blacharska\n* ''Berserkir'', Bödvar Bjarki and the Dragon Fáfnir: The Influence of Selected Medieval Icelandic Sagas on Tolkien's Works for Children\n** By: Renata Leśniakiewicz-Drzymała\n* 'He has gone to God glory seeking': Tolkien's Critique of the Northern Courage and Rejection of the Traditional Heroic Ethos in \"The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm's Son\"\n** By: [[Łukasz Neubauer]]\n* What Exactly Does Tolkien Argue for in \"''Beowulf'': The Monsters and the Critics?\" An Attempt at a Metacriticism\n** By: Andrzej Wicher\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.walking-tree.org/books/o_what_a_tangled_web.php Official product page]\n\n{{Cormarë}}\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]"}}}
