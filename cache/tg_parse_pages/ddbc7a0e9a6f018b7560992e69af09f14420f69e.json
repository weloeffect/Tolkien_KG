They seek not to travel west either in life or after death, believing that the way there is forever closed to them, and have developed an elaborate system  of beliefs and rituals regarding their fate after death, whether through fading or through violence in battle. The Wise who journey through those lands eventually reveal to some of the Kinta that some of what they believe is not entirely true.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Avarin words]]\n[[Category:Avari]]\n[[Category:Elven peoples]]"}}}
