In the footnote 1 of the Preface of [[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]] it was spelled ''Sernui''<ref>{{AB|Preface}}</ref> until the 2014 edition, where the editors [[Christina Scull]] and [[Wayne G. Hammond]] have changed the name to ''Serni'', considering ''Sernui'' \"very likely a typographic error for ''Serni''\" even though they refer to a comment by [[Carl F. Hostetter]] who informed them that ''sernui'' \"would be possible as an unattested adjectival formation *'stony' from ''sarn'' 'stone'\".<ref>{{AB|Comm}}, p. 120-121; cf. Preface, p. 31.</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIt is mentioned that the Serni continued to be called the Serni after its confluence with the Gilraen until it flowed into the sea and that its mouth was blocked with shingles in the entry ''Serni'' in the index of ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' that was written by [[Christopher Tolkien]] in [[1980]] and in the etymological essay [[The Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor]] that was written by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] sometime after June [[1969]].<ref name=UTIndex/><ref name=NM/><ref>{{VT|42a}}, entry '''''Gilrain''''', p. 10</ref> In addition, the label \"Serni\" is placed downstream from the confluence of the two rivers not far upstream from where the river flows into the Bay of Belfalas on the map of [[The West of Middle-earth at the End of the Third Age]], which was drawn by Christopher Tolkien and published with ''Unfinished Tales'' in 1980.<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>\n\nOn the [[General Map of Middle-earth]], which was drawn by Christopher Tolkien in late [[1953]] and published with older editions of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' the \"R\" of the label \"River GILRAIN\" is placed downstream from the confluence of the two rivers not far upstream where the river flows into the Bay of Belfalas. This is consistent with the location of the \"R\" in the label \"R Gilrain\" on [[The Third Map of The Lord of the Rings]], which was drawn by J.R.R. Tolkien during the writing of ''The Lord of the Rings'' based on which Christopher Tolkien drew the General Map of Middle-earth. The text of a revised version of the draft manuscript for the chapter ''[[The Last Debate]]'' explicitly states that Linhir and the fords were on the shore of the Gilrain, that the men of Lamedon defended the passage over the Gilrain at Linhir and that the enemy had sailed up the mouth of the Gilrain.<ref>{{WR|3|XII}}, \"to Linhir beside the waters of Gilrain where there are fords that lead into Lebennin\" and \"There the men of Lamedon had been contesting the passage of Gilrain with a great strength of the Haradrim, and of their allies the Shipmen of Umbar, who had sailed up Gilrainmouth\", pp. 411-2</ref><ref>[[Christopher Tolkien]], [[General Map of Middle-earth]] (published in older editions of [[The Lord of the Rings]]).</ref>\n\nFor the joint course of the Gilrain and the Serni from their confluence to the sea the name ''Linhir'' was also used.<ref>{{HM|UI}}, entry ''Linhir'', \"name of the joint course of Gilrain and Ringlo [i.e. Serni] bet[ween] their junction and the sea\", p. 587</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2014: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The river Serni was found in Lower [[Lebennin]] in the region of Central [[Gondor]]. As its name indicated, it was strewn with rocks. There were two fords, with the western one being south of the town of \"Malbarth\" and the eastern one south of \"Ost Anglebed\". The Serni was the domain of the stern River-maid Grey-eye, one of the Five Sisters, though she and her sisters were widely considered a myth by the time of the [[War of the Ring]].\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Gondor]]\n[[Category:Rivers]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[de:Serni]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/eaux/gondor/serni]]\n[[fi:Serni]]"}}}
