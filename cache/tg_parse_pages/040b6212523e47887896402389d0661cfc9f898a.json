These men came up from the [[Greenway]] into [[Bree]] out of lands to the south around [[Dunland]]. They had come up into the [[Bree-land]]s looking for a place of peace from the unrest in their homes, though a few such as the [[squint-eyed southerner]] were in fact spies of [[Saruman]] and were not to be trusted.<ref>{{FR|Sign}}</ref>\n\n==Other writings==\n===''The End of Bovadium''===\nIn the Foreword of ''[[The End of Bovadium]]''<ref name=CGL>[[Letter to Rayner Unwin (2 December 1968)]], quoted in {{CG|C}}, p. 737 (entry \"2 December 1968\")</ref>, [[Doctor Sarevelk]] labeled the Vastians who dwelt south of the ''[[Via Maxima]]''<ref name=\"FII\">{{TBF|II}}</ref> in ''[[Bovadium]]'' as '''A-people''' since they were the speakers of [[language A]].<ref name=\"Foreword\">{{TBF|Foreword}}</ref> In Fragment II of the text, the A-people<ref name=\"Foreword\" /> are referred to as '''Southerners'''. During the takeover of the city by the ''[[Motores Bi]]'', the Southerners were not as affected because their lands were \"guarded by great gates and iron bars\" that the ''Motores'' could not pass. As a consequence, they were still able to enjoy a peace free from the ''Motores''. However, after the [[Northerners]] became jealous of them and proposed to the Minister that a new road should be built \"through the southern meadows\", the Southerners distracted the Minister with their own proposals. But this was futile since the Minister choose not to do anything proposed by the Southerners or the Northerners and would have proceeded with his own plan had he not gotten trapped in the [[Capital City]].
