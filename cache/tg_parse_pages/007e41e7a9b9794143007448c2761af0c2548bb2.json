It was the name of the icy tundra in the northern parts of [[Middle-earth]], and especially of the great [[Icebay of Forochel|icebay]] and the lands that surrounded it, such as the [[Cape of Forochel]].\n\nIt was inhabited by the [[Lossoth]], a hardy tribe of [[Men]] descended from the [[Forodwaith (people)|Forodwaith]]. Most Men of the region lived on the Cape of Forochel near the Great Sea of [[Belegaer]] but some built their villages on the shores of the Icebay itself.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Forochel.mp3|Ardamir}}\n''Forochel'' is a [[Sindarin]] name. It is a compound of ''[[forod]]'' (\"north\") and ''khel'' (\"ice\").<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 116, entry S ''forochel''</ref> Therefore it means \"Northern Ice\".<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-2976544327.html|articlename=S.

The language and culture of its people, the Lossoth, are modeled after the Finnish. An ''aurora borealis'' effect can be seen in the sky. Prior to the release of Western [[Gondor]], it was the only region in the game world where the ocean was visible, but players will freeze to death if attempting to swim in it.\n:The capital of the region is '''[[Sûri-kylä]]''', said to mean \"Large Village\"; at the westernmost point of the settlement stands the Great Lodge with the Council of Elders and the Lossoth leader Yrjänä.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Eriador]]\n[[Category:Pronounced articles]]\n[[Category:Regions]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[de:Forochel]]\n[[fi:Forochel]]"}}}
