This caused them to forget their names and wander distraught within the woods. Eventually, upon the death of the [[Glaurung|Foalókë]], the dragon lifted the veil that Kurúki had placed on Vainóni, causing her to flee through the woods and throw herself over a waterfall.<ref name=\"Kurúki\">{{LT2|IIn}}, pp. 138-40</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe meaning of the name ''Kurúki'' is unclear, but it seems to contain the [[Qenya]] word ''[[kuru]]'' (\"magic, wizardry\").<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry \"[[Tolli Kuruvar]]\"</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nIn later versions of ''[[Narn i Chîn Húrin (tale)|the tale of the Children of Húrin]]'', the character of Kurúki was discarded, and [[Glaurung]] took on the magician's former role of erasing [[Nienóri|Nienóri's]] memory in addition to his own role of breaking the spell of forgetfulness. In addition, Nienor is chased into Brethil by [[Orc-hunters]] in the final version. Interestingly, [[Christopher Tolkien]] notes that it is probable that the outline fragment that Kurúki appears in may be a unique glimpse into a draft of the ''[[Turambar and the Foalókë|Tale of Turambar]]'' that predates even the erased text which many of the stories found within ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' were written over.<ref name=\"Kurúki\" />\n\n{{References}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kuruki}}\n\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Evil]]\n[[Category:Qenya names]]"}}}
