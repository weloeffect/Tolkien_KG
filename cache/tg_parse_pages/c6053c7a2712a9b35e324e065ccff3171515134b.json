R. R. Tolkien'', it was always designed as a totally independent and original work. \n\nIt was commissioned in 1982 by James Meaker both as a display piece and as a symphonic poem in rondo form based on one of the concluding chapters in J R R Tolkien’s ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. As such some of the material later found its way into other parts of the cycle.\n\nIt was subsequently orchestrated and modified as ''Akallabêth (for orchestra), Op. 42a'' and sections of it were used in the score for ''[[The War of Wrath, Op. 71 (Opera)]].''\n\n== Recordings ==\nA recording of this work is available on Prima Facie's 2017 album ''Akallabêth and other Tolkien works''.\n[[Category:Classical music]]"}}}
