Tolkien]]. It was published in [[2009]].\n\nThe two poems that make up most of the book were probably written during the 1930s, and were inspired by the legend of [[Wikipedia:Sigurd|Sigurd]] and the fall of the [[Wikipedia:Niflungs|Niflungs]] in Norse mythology. Both poems are in a form of alliterative verse. [[Christopher Tolkien]] has added copious notes and commentary to the work.\n\n==Overview==\nThe book contains two long poems: '''''The New Lay of the Völsungs''''' and '''''The New Lay of Gudrún''''', with commentaries by Christopher Tolkien.\n\nThe book also includes two shorter, related poems in [[Old English]] and an \"Introduction to the 'Elder Edda'\" (based on lecture manuscripts) by J.R.R. Tolkien.\n\n==Contents==\n[[File:J.R.R.

Tolkien, which tells the epic story of the Norse hero, Sigurd, the dragon-slayer, the revenge of his wife, Gudrún, and the Fall of the Nibelungs.}}\n\n{{blockquote|“Many years ago, J.R.R. Tolkien composed his own version, now published for the first time, of the great legend of Northern antiquity, in two closely related poems to which he gave the titles The New Lay of the Völsungs and The New Lay of Gudrún.<br>\nIn the Lay of the Völsungs is told the ancestry of the great hero Sigurd, the slayer of Fáfnir most celebrated of dragons, whose treasure he took for his own; of his awakening of the Valkyrie Brynhild who slept surrounded by a wall of fire, and of their betrothal; and of his coming to the court of the great princes who were named the Niflungs (or Nibelungs), with whom he entered into blood-brotherhood. In that court there sprang great love but also great hate, brought about by the power of the enchantress, mother of the Niflungs, skilled in the arts of magic, of shape-changing and potions of forgetfulness.<br>\nIn scenes of dramatic intensity, of confusion of identity, thwarted passion, jealousy and bitter strife, the tragedy of Sigurd and Brynhild, of Gunnar the Niflung and Gudrún his sister, mounts to its end in the murder of Sigurd at the hands of his blood-brothers, the suicide of Brynhild, and the despair of Gudrún. In the Lay of Gudrún her fate after the death of Sigurd is told, her marriage against her will to the mighty Atli, ruler of the Huns (the Attila of history), his murder of her brothers the Niflung lords, and her hideous revenge.<br>\nDeriving his version primarily from his close study of the ancient poetry of Norway and Iceland known as the Poetic Edda (and where no old poetry exists, from the later prose work the Völsunga Saga), J.R.R. Tolkien employed a verse-form of short stanzas whose lines embody in English the exacting alliterative rhythms and the concentrated energy of the poems of the Edda.”|Christopher Tolkien}}\n\n==Relation to the legendarium==\nWhile ''The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún'' is naturally not directly connected to the stories of [[Arda]] and [[Middle-earth]], Christopher Tolkien notes a few related concepts which occur in the work:\n\n*''[[Wargs]]'' (p.&nbsp;373, note 37)\n*''[[Ents]]'' (p.&nbsp;376, note 17)\n* [[Túrin]] slaying [[Morgoth]] or [[Ancalagon|Ancalagon the Black]] in the [[Dagor Dagorath]] resembles [[:Wikipedia:Sigurd|Sigurd]] killing [[:Wikipedia:Miðgarðsormr|Miðgarðsormr]] (p. ??, \"Commentary on ''Völsungskviða en nýja''\", \"Upphaf\")\n* [[Manwë]] is compared to [[:Wikipedia:Odin|Odin]], father of the gods. (p. ??, \"Commentary on ''Völsungskviða en nýja''\", \"Upphaf\")\n\nA few other concepts also found in this work, from which Tolkien likely derived material for his [[legendarium]], are worthy of note:\n\n* ''[[Mirkwood]]'' (pp.&nbsp;131, 227-8, 372)\n* ''[[Moriquendi|Dark Elves]]'', ''[[Light-elves|Light Elves]]'', ''[[Dwarves]]'' (pp.&nbsp;358–60)\n\n==Publication history and gallery==\n;UK editions\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"125px\" heights=\"125px\">\nFile:Sigurd and Gudrún 2009.jpg |2009 hardcover\nFile:Sigurd and Gudrún deluxe.jpeg ‎|2009 hardcover deluxe edition\nFile:Sigurd and Gudrún 2010.jpeg ‎|2010 paperback\nFile:Sigurd and Gudrún 2025 hc.jpg|2025 hardcover (boxed set)\nFile:Sigurd and Gudrún 2025 pb.jpeg ‎|2025 paperback\n</gallery>\n*[[HarperCollins]] hardcover ([[2009]]), pp.&nbsp;384.
