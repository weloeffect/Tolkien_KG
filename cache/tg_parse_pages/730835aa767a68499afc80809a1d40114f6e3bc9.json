Grinnah was invented by [[Warner Bros.]] for [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]], where he was portrayed by [[Stephen Ure]], who also portrayed [[Fimbul]].\n\n== History ==\nGrinnah appeared to be a significant member of the Goblin-town hierarchy, as he directly reported to the [[Great Goblin]] when they captured [[Thorin and Company]] at the [[Front Porch]]. He was responsible for discovering [[Orcrist]] on [[Thorin|Thorin Oakenshield]], and showing it to the Great Goblin, who angrily ordered his subordinates to kill Thorin. When [[Gandalf]] arrived to rescue the Dwarves and they took up arms to fight their way out, Grinnah was stabbed to death by [[Kíli]].<ref>''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]''</ref>\n\n== Personality ==\nGrinnah was cunning and vicious, but much like the other goblins, he is a coward. Despite his apparent loyality to the Great Goblin, he actually hated him in secret.<ref>{{webcite|website=[http://www.theonering.com The One Ring]|articleurl=http://www.theonering.com/complete-list-of-film-changes/the-hobbit-an-unexpected-journey|articlename=An Unexpected Journey﻿|accessed=1 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Orcs from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Hobbit (film series) characters]]\n\n[[fi:Grinnah (elokuvahahmo)]]"}}}
