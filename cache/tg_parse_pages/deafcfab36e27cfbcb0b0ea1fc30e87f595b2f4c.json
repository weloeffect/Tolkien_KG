When [[Ilúvatar]] pointed out that this was against His plans, and reprimanded him, and that Aulë, as a Vala, had no power to make animate creations.

His early rule was marked by clashes with the servants of [[Morgoth]], which led Durin to search for a new home for his people to the south. After finding [[Mithril|true-silver]] near [[Kheled-zâram]], Durin took the majority of his people there to found [[Khazad-dûm]], leaving the rest to be ruled by his closest friend Mótsog in Gundabad. Hearing no word from Durin for many long years, Mótsog grew jealous of him and proclaimed himself King in open rebellion.\n\n:Fearing an ambush in Gundabad where secret entrances were known only to Durin himself, Mótsog build for himself a new stronghold to the south, Biriz-zahar. A bloody civil war followed, in which dwarves slew one another. Eventually, Durin himself was captured by Mótsog and put to mockery. His Queen Ragna the Fierce led a daring rescue attempt, which was interrupted when Morgoth saw a chance to destroy the Longbeards at their weakest. [[Sauron]] send nine [[dragon]]s and at least one [[balrog]] to assault Biriz-zahar, as well as countless [[orc]]s. \n\n:Facing extinction, Durin convinced Mótsog to abandon the feud and to fight against the common foe. Through grievous losses, the dwarves won the day, killing five dragons and many thousands of orcs. Durin gave mercy to the few surviving rebels, though as penance they and their descendants were made to shear their beards for many generations after. The fate of Mótsog himself was not known, but it was believed in later ages that Durin slew the traitor.\n\n{{references|notes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Durin}}\n\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n| name=Durin I\n| race=dwarf\n| house=[[Durin's Folk|House of Durin]]\n}}\n{{seq\n| pvac=None\n| prev=Position created\n| prow=2\n| list=[[Kings of Durin's Folk|King of Durin's Folk]]\n| nvac=Unknown\n| next=Next known:<br/>[[Durin II]]\n| nrow=2\n}}\n{{seq\n| list=[[Kings of Khazad-dûm|King of Khazad-dûm]]\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n\n{{durinskings}}\n[[Category: Dwarves]]\n[[Category:Dwarven names]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Kings of Durin's Folk]]\n[[Category:Kings of Khazad-dûm]]\n[[Category:Longbeards]]\n[[Category:Norse names]]\n[[de:Durin I.]]\n[[fr:encyclo:personnages:nains:1a:durin ier]]\n[[fi:Durin Kuolematon]]"}}}
