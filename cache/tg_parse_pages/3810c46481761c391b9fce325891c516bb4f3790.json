I was glad to hear that you enjoyed my books so much. I agree with you about illustrations; it is far better to use one's imagination, as you clearly have done.<br/><br/>I am very busy at the moment as I am moving house, so I hope you will excuse me if I write only a short letter to you.<br/><br/>Again, thank you for your appreciation and I hope that you will continue to get so much enjoyment out of Aragorn, Gandalf, and all the others!<br/><br/>Yours sincerely,<br/>pp. J.R.R. Tolkien}}\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Letters|Heilborn, Eva]]"}}}
