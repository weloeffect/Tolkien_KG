It accompanies the intensely anticipated movies from New Line Cinema, Warner Bros. Pictures and MGM: ''The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey'', ''The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug'' and ''The Hobbit: There and Back Again''.<br/><br/>The first chronicle in the series, Art and Design presents hundreds of full colour conceptual drawings and paintings, along with set designs, sculpture and glorious photography across more than 200 pages.<br/><br/>The book showcases art by the film’s concept art directors, Academy Award® Winner Alan Lee and John Howe alongside work from other artists of the film’s 3 foot 7 Art Department, Costume Department and Weta Workshop.<br/><br/>It truly is a unique opportunity to see artwork by a wide range of artists across a multitude of disciplines in the film-making community of Wellington, New Zealand and to hear directly from them about the inspiration behind their work. <br/><br/>\nIncluded is a Foreword by Academy Award winner Dan Hennah, 3 foot 7 Production Designer for the films. The book also features commentaries by Dan, 3 foot 7 Costume Designer Ann Maskrey, Academy Award Winners Peter King, 3 foot 7 Make-up and Hair Designer, and Weta Workshop’s Design and Special Effects Supervisor Richard Taylor.  In addition to artist quotes, cast members reflect on the work and share insights into their involvement in the design process.<br/><br/>“We are very excited to be creating a series of books that celebrate the amazing work that is being done on The Hobbit movies.  They will show the incredible attention to detail that goes into everything that is being produced for these films and are a wonderful opportunity to showcase the designs and artistry of so many people within their respective departments.” Richard Taylor, Weta Workshop.<br/><br/>Readers will be able to follow the design process as it unfolds with early sketches and final designs.  The book offers an unprecedented insight into the conceptual processes behind the making of an epic film.<br/><br/>“We are thrilled to be involved with the Weta Publishing team in the creation of the Hobbit (Specialist) Books. It is a fantastic opportunity to showcase the work produced by our amazingly talented artists & craftspeople who are responsible for conceptualizing, designing & building the sets, props and dressings for The Hobbit.” Dan Hennah, 3 foot 7 Art Department.<br/><br/>The book is written by Weta Workshop senior designer Daniel Falconer.  Daniel has an excellent pedigree in all things related to Middle-earth, being a pivotal concept designer on The Lord of the Rings and now part of the Weta Workshop design team on The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.  He is also an avid fan of the books of J.R.R. Tolkien, making him eminently suited to telling the stories of the artisans’ work based on Tolkien’s book; The Hobbit.}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.wetanz.com/the-hobbit-chronicles-an-unexpected-journey/ The Hobbit Chronicles at Weta Website]\n{{hobbitfilms}}\n{{title|italics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey: Chronicles: Art & Design, the}}\n[[Category:The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey tie-in books]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
