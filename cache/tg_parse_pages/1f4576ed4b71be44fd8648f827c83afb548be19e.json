Though a choice will come to the Dúnedain, and if they take the one that seems less hopeful, then your son will change his name and become king of a great realm.

However the [[Gondorians]] ruled out his claim (\"the one that seems less hopeful\") choosing instead [[Earnil II|someone]] from the [[House of Anárion]], so Arvedui never became \"king of a great realm\" and didn't change his name. Instead as Malbeth said, there was \"much sorrow\"; the [[Battle of Fornost]] destroyed the North-kingdom, and Arvedui was drowned in the sea soon after, the last king of Arthedain.<ref>{{App|A}}</ref>\n\nMalbeth's second prophecy was also fulfilled centuries later, during the [[War of the Ring]] when Aragorn (sixteenth [[Chieftain of the Dúnedain]]) learned from the ''[[palantíri|palantír]]'' that [[Gondor]] was being threatened from the south by a fleet of [[Corsairs]] from [[Umbar]]. He needed a route to get to them in haste, and [[Elrond]]'s message (\"''Bid Aragorn remember the words of the seer, and the [[Paths of the Dead]]''\") told him how. Aragorn (with [[Legolas]], [[Gimli]] and the [[Grey Company]]) travelled through the Paths of the Dead to the Stone of Erech where Aragorn blew a horn to summon the [[Oathbreakers]]. He told them he was [[Isildur]]'s heir and so they fulfilled their oath and defeated the Corsairs which helped Gondor win the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].<ref name=company>{{RK|Company}}</ref>\n\nAragorn fulfilled again the first prophecy, where Arvedui had failed; after \"much sorrow and many lives of men\", Aragorn finally became [[High King of the Dúnedain]] who were \"[[Reunited Kingdom|united again]]\".\n\n==Etymology==\n''Malbeth'' is [[Sindarin]] for \"Golden Word\", from ''[[malt]]'' (\"gold\") + [[Lenition|lenited]] ''[[peth]]'' (\"word, voice\").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3294592247.html|articlename=S.
