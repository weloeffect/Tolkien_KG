With over three decades in the Greek metal scene, he has performed with bands such as Leprosy, Obsecration, Empty Mirror, and DivUrge. His work combines symphonic and power-metal elements with complex storytelling, often drawing inspiration from high-fantasy literature.\n\nIn November 2025, InfuseR released his debut Tolkien-inspired solo concept album, ''A Tale of Tales'', which transforms the lore of Middle-earth into an immersive epic metal journey. Known for his technical skill and compositional versatility, he has collaborated with many notable Greek metal musicians and continues to explore ambitious solo projects.\n\n==Discography==\n* [[A Tale of Tales]] (2025)\n* ''Muted Screams(single)'' (2024)\n\n==External links==\n* [https://infusergr.bandcamp.com/ InfuseR on Bandcamp]  \n* [https://www.youtube.com/@infuser-music YouTube: InfuseR Music]  \n* [https://www.facebook.com/Manos.InfuseR.Psarros/ Facebook: InfuseR]  \n* [https://www.instagram.com/infuser_music/ Instagram: InfuseR Music]\n\n[[Category:Bands]]\n[[Category:Composers]]"}}}
