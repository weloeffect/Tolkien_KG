See {{SM|A5}} and p. 306. However, this depiction predates Tolkien's conception of the wide lands of Eriador, Gondor, and Mordor that lay east of the Blue Mountains, as well as the non-mountainous passageway connecting Eriador and Beleriand that lay between the Great Gulf and the Blue Mountains.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[War of Wrath]], most of Beleriand was drowned, and much of the Great Gulf would have vanished with it. Although not explicitly stated, the eastern end of the Great Gulf in Eriador likely became the [[Bay of Belfalas]].\n\n{{references|note}}\n[[Category:Bays]]\n[[fi:Suuri Lahti]]"}}}
