Rhudaur was located in the North-east between the Weather Hills, the [[Ettenmoors]] and the [[Misty Mountains]], and also included the [[Angle]] between the and the [[Bruinen]] and the [[Hoarwell]]. Cardolan lay in the South, with its borders consisting of the [[Gwathló]], Brandywine, and the Royal Road.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Appendix A]], \"The Númenorean Kings\", \"Eriador, Arnor, and the Heirs of Isildur\", ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', pp. 1039-1040</ref>\n\nThe line of Isildur endured In Arthedain, but in Rhudaur and Cardolan the line was soon broken. There was frequent conflict between the three kingdoms, with the primary source of strife being the ownership of the Weather Hills and the territories stretching west towards [[Bree]]. Rhudaur and Cardolan wished to lay claim to [[Amon Sûl]], which stood on the borders between the two kingdoms. The Tower held the chief [[Palantíri|Palantír]] of the North, with the other two being in the possession Arthedain.<ref name=\":0\">{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', pp. 1040-1041</ref>\n\nThen, during the beginning of the reign of [[Malvegil]] of Arthedein, a great evil saw opportunity in the quarreling among the [[Dúnedain of Arnor]]. The [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]], lord of the realm which arose in the North beyond the Ettenmoors, thus came to the three kingdoms with the purpose of destroying them.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSince the line of [[Isildur]] was broken in all of the other kingdoms, the kings of Arthedain claimed the lordship of all Arnor. Arthedain's claim was challanged by Rhudaur, where the remnants of the [[Dúnedain]] were dwindling. After forging a secret alliance with the Witch-king, the evil lord of the [[Hillmen]] seized power there, causing [[Argeleb I|Argeleb]] of Arthedain to fortify the [[Weather Hills]].<ref name=\":0\" /> He was subsequently slain in a battle against Rhudaur and Angmar in [[Third Age 1356|T.A. 1356]].<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nWith the aid of Cardolan and [[Lindon]], [[Argeleb I|Argeleb]]'s son, [[Arveleg I|Arveleg]], drove back the forces of Rhudaur and Angmar from the Weather Hills. For many years Arthedain and Cardolan maintained a force there, as well as along the [[Royal Road]] and the lower [[Hoarwell]]. At the same time that this force was being maintained, Angmar laid siege to [[Rivendell]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBy [[Third Age 1409|T.A. 1409]], a large number of the Witch-king's forces had entered Cardolan and surrounded [[Weathertop]]. In the events that followed this incursion, the Dúnedain were defeated and Arveleg was slain. The fleeing Dúnedain managed to save the [[Palantíri|palantír]] at Amon Sûl in spite of the Tower's burning and razing and carried it with them during their retreat to [[Fornost Erain|Fornost]]. Cardolan, too, was ravaged, and Rhudaur came under the dominion of evil [[Men]] who were loyal to the Witch-king, with the remaining Dúnedain there being slain or fleeing west.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nArveleg's young son, [[Araphor]],<ref name=\":1\" /> enlisted the aid of [[Círdan]] and repelled the forces of Angmar from Fornost and the [[North Downs]].<ref name=\":0\" /> A remnant of the faithful Dúnedain also held out in the [[Barrow-downs]] - where the [[last prince of Cardolan]] came to be buried in T.A. 1409<ref name=\"Eriador\">{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', p. 1041</ref> - or took refuge in the [[Old Forest]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFor a time following T.A. 1409, the forces of Angmar were quelled by the [[Elves]] of Lindon and also by [[Elrond]], who had brought forces from [[Lothlórien]] over the [[Misty Mountains]]. Due to the wars, the presence of Angmar's forces, and the worsening climate, the [[Stoors]] that occupied the Angle fled to the west and south, with some returning to the [[Wilderland]] beside the [[Gladden River|Gladden]] riverside.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBy [[Third Age 1636|T.A. 1636]], during the reign of [[Argeleb II]],<ref name=\":1\" /> the [[Great Plague]] had fallen upon [[Eriador]].<ref name=\":2\" /> Arriving from the South-east, it killed most of the people of Cardolan, with [[Minhiriath]] being especially badly affected. Though it lessened as it passed northwards and had little effect on Arthedain, the [[Hobbits]] and all other peoples experienced great suffering due to the sickness. As time passed, the Plague brought forth the final ruin of the Cardolan and its Dúnedain, and the evil spirits of Rhudaur and Angmar entered its empty mounds and dwelt there.<ref name=\"Eriador\" />\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Angmar conflict]]\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Conflicts of the Angmar War]]"}}}
