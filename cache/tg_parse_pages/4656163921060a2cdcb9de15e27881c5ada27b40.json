It was extended in the latter edition.\n\n== Synopsis ==\n[[Gandalf]] and the company from [[Orthanc]] return to the [[Golden Hall]] to take rest and honour those who died for victory at the [[Battle of Helm's Deep]].\n\nDuring the feasting, [[Théoden]] speaks with [[Éowyn]], telling her that he is happy for Éowyn's love for [[Aragorn]], and that Aragorn was largely responsible for victory at [[Helm's Deep]]. [[Legolas]] and [[Gimli]] take part in a drinking game with [[Éomer]] watching and serving drinks. Gimli becomes quite clearly intoxicated very quickly and passes out, while Legolas merely feels ''\"a slight tingle\"'' in his fingers. [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] dance to music on a table to the delight of a large crowd. Aragorn discusses [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] with Gandalf, saying that he moves closer to [[Mordor]] every day. Gandalf questions how they can know that for sure, and, in reply, Aragorn asks Gandalf, ''\"what does you heart tell you?\"''\n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King scenes|05]]"}}}
