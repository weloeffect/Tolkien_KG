R. R. Tolkien, as none of his fiction provides an all-encompassing narrative of the events of that 3,500-year period of Middle-earth’s history. Only through the efforts of Tolkien’s son Christopher has the public been able to appreciate the full grandeur of the Second Age, which is revealed in Tolkien’s meticulous notes and unfinished works. The Second Age is made up of two great narrative channels: on the one hand the rise and cataclysmic downfall of the island kingdom of Númenor and its aftermath, and on the other the forging of the Rings of Power and the rise of the new dark lord, Sauron. Illustrated World of Tolkien: The Second Age includes more than 120 illustrations depicting the characters and events of this period—along with insightful commentary from renowned Tolkien scholar David Day—making it an essential addition to the library of every Lord of the Rings fan.}}\n\n{{title|italics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Illustrated World of Tolkien: The Second Age}}\n[[Category:Books by David Day]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]"}}}
