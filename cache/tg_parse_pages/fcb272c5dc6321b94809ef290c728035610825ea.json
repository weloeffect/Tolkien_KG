At the [[Barrow-downs]] they became so frightened that they ran off to find Fatty. Tom called them all back with the names he had given them: Sharp-ears, [[Bumpkin]], [[Wise-nose]], [[Swish-tail]], and [[White-socks]]. He returned them to the hobbits, along with the baggage they had been carrying.<ref>{{FR|Barrow}}</ref>\n\nDuring their stay at the ''[[Prancing Pony]]'' the Hobbits' ponies were let out to delay their departure from [[Bree]]. They ran out in the  Downs to find Fatty. They stayed with Tom for a while, until he had heard news of the events at Bree. He sent the ponies to [[Barliman Butterbur]], and they stayed there working for Barliman, where they were well cared for by [[Bob]].<ref>{{FR|Knife}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nWhen [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote the manuscript for ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' all of the ponies used by the hobbits had the same names as in the final story, except for Sharp-ears.  His original name was \"Four-foot\".<ref>{{RS|Wight}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Horses]]\n[[de:Löffelohr]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/animaux/chevaux/ouie fine]]\n[[fi:Hörökorva]]"}}}
