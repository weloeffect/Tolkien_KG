Of his ventures there no man has told, save that hunted by the orbed Moon he fled back to Valinor, and mounting the towers of Kôr upon the rocks of Eglamar he gazed back upon the Oceans of the World. To Eglamar he comes ever at plenilune when the Moon sails a-harrying beyond Taniquetil and Valinor.''\n\n==Poem excerpt==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">East of the Moon, west of the Sun\nthere stands a lonely hill;\nits feet are in the pale green sea,\nits towers are white and still,\nbeyond Taniquetil\nin Valinor.</poem>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Éalá Éarendel Engla Beorhtast]]\n*[[The Bidding of the Minstrel]]\n*[[The Happy Mariners]]\n*[[Index:Poems by J.R.R.
