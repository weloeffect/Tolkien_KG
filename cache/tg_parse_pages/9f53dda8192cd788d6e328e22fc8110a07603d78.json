They give her the names ''[[Tintallë]]'' (\"Kindler\") or ''[[Elentári]]''/''Elbereth'' (\"Star-queen\").<ref>{{S|IIb}}</ref>\n\nWhile the evil of [[Morgoth]] [[Arda Marred|corrupted]] the whole of [[Arda]] the ancient stars contain the unsullied light of creation.<ref>{{ER|R2}}, p. 152</ref>\n\n==History==\nVarda created the first stars in the earliest ages of the creation of [[Arda]].<ref>{{S|1}}</ref> \n[[File:Anke Eißmann - Stargazing.jpeg|250px|thumb|right|''Stargazing'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]\nAges later, prior to the [[awakening of the Elves]], Varda grouped together many of the ancient stars into [[constellations]], including [[Menelmacar]] (Orion), and the [[Valacirca]] (the Sickle of the Valar, the Big Dipper), as signs in the heavens of [[Arda]]<ref>{{S|3}}</ref> \"that the gods may read\".<ref>{{MR|P3I3}}</ref> She also created new ones using collected light from the Silver Tree, [[Telperion]]. These included [[Carnil]], [[Luinil]], [[Nénar]], [[Lumbar]], [[Alcarinquë]], and [[Elemmírë]]<ref group=\"note\">In his introduction to the Index of ''[[Morgoth's Ring]]'', [[Christopher Tolkien]] identifies these, respectively, with the planets Mars, Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mercury. Most of these identifications appear to be fairly certain, although there are astronomical problems with the identifications of Neptune and Uranus in the context of the mythology. Note that Venus is not included on this list, as in the mythology, it is not a star (or planet), but rather a [[Silmarils|Silmaril]].</ref>.\n\nThe Elves first awoke under the stars and, according to tradition, the stars were the first thing they saw, and the first word spoken by them was ''ele!'', a primitive exclamation meaning \"behold\"! From this origin derived the ancient words ''el'' and ''elen'' for \"Star\".<ref>{{S|Elements}}</ref>  Moreover, when [[Oromë]] first met the Elves, he too associated them with the stars and named them the [[Eldar]], the \"People of the Stars\".<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref>  \n\nThe [[Star of Eärendil]] is a unique case. Following his successful mission to persuade the Valar to intervene in the wars against [[Morgoth]] in the [[First Age]], [[Eärendil]] and his ship [[Vingilot]], along with the last remaining [[Silmarils|Silmaril]], were placed in the sky as a sign of hope to the faithful people of [[Middle-earth]]. After the war against Morgoth was concluded, a group of the [[Edain]] followed Eärendil's star to the newly created island that would become [[Númenor]]. Consequently, one of the names of that island was [[Elenna]], or \"Starwards\". <ref group=\"note\">The Star of Eärendil is identified with the Evening or Morning Star, i.e. the planet Venus.</ref>\n\n===In culture===\nEmblems also featured stars. An eight-rayed star represented the [[House of Fëanor]], and seven eight-rayed stars above a crown and anvil were the emblems of [[Durin]]. Both of these were depicted on the [[Doors of Durin|West-gate of Moria]] (the former because [[Celebrimbor]], one of the makers of the doors, was a descendant of Fëanor). Seven stars appeared on the banner of Gondor. Certain jewels are also described as stars, notably the [[Star of Elendil]] that Aragorn wore into the Battle of Pelennor Fields. In the [[Lay of Nimrodel]], it is said that \"''A star was bound upon her brow'',\" clearly describing some kind of jewel.\n\nOther prominent references to stars include:\n*The [[Quenya]] greeting, ''[[Elen síla lúmenn' omentielvo]]'' (Quenya: \"A star shines on the hour of our meeting.\")\n*Frodo, from the window of his room in [[Rivendell]], observed a red star foreshadowing the [[Eye of Sauron]]: \"''But low in the South one star shone red ... deep in the heavens burning like a watchful eye that glared above the trees on the brink of the valley''.\"<ref>{{FR|II3}}</ref><ref group=\"note\">While recognizing its allegorical nature, scholars have attempted to identify this star in the night sky. [[David Turner]], \"Stars of fancy\" in ''Nova Notes'' (newsletter of the Halifax Center of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada), vol. 27, no. 2, avril 1996, identifies it with Sirius, supposedly reddish many aeons ago. [[Alain Lefèvre]], \"L’astre rouge de la Lune du Chasseur\" (French) in ''[[Tolkien, le façonnement d'un monde]]'', vol. 2, 2014, pp. 29-41, argues against Sirius and retains Mars as possible candidate. As an aside note, \"Saruman's Book\" in [[Peter Jackson]]'s adaptation includes pages in [[tengwar]] (movie prop designed by [[Daniel Reeve]]) mentioning the \"red star of Sauron\" and its supposedly (non-[[Canon|canonical]]) strange effects on nature.</ref>\n*[[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]]'s song in [[Cirith Ungol]] concludes \"...above all shadows rides the Sun, and Stars for ever dwell. I will not say the Day is done, nor bid the Stars farewell.\"\n*Travelling through [[Mordor]], Sam saw a star, leading him to conclude that \"''In the end the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach.''\"\n\n==Other names==\n\n*[[Sundocarme|Root]] [[EL]]\n\n*[[Quenya]]\n**''[[elen]]''\n**''[[tinwë]]'' (also means \"spark\")\n**''[[tingilya]]'' and ''[[tingilindë]]'' \"twinkling star\"\n**''[[elvëa]]'' \"starlike\"\n**''[[silmë]]'' \"starlight\"\n**''[[tindómë]]'' \"starry twilight\"\n\n*[[Sindarin]]\n**''[[êl]]''\n**''[[gil]]''\n**''[[tîn#Noun|tîn, tin]]''\n**''[[tinu]]''\n**''[[Gil-galad|gilgalad]]'' \"starlight\"\n**''[[elenath]]'' \"starry\" or \"stars\"\n**''[[giliath]]'' \"hosts of stars\"\n\n*[[Noldorin]]\n**''[[gíl]]''\n**''[[tinw]]''\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nSo important was this identification of the Elves with the stars to [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] that when he considered revising his creation myths so that the Sun and Moon existed from an earlier time (see ''[[Myths Transformed]]''), he still insisted that the Elves must have awoken under the stars.  \n{{references|n}}\n{{cosmology}}\n\n[[Category:Creations of the Valar]]\n[[Category:Stars| Stars]]\n[[fi:Tähdet]]"}}}
