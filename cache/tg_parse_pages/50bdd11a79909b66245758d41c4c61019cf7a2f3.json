Tolkien - Cortirion.png|thumb|left|200px|''Cortirion'' by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]\nKortirion was founded by [[Ingil]] son of [[Inwë]], and the [[Elves]] of [[Kôr]] that came with him to [[Tol Eressëa]] following the [[March of Liberation]]. He called the town ''Koromas'', meaning \"the Resting of the Exiles of Kôr\", and built a [[Tirin na Gilweth|great tower]] there. The city was afterwards often called ''Kortirion'', in reference to the tower.<ref name=\"Cot\">{{LT1|I}}, p. 16</ref>\n\n=== Arrival of Eriol ===\nLocated in the city was the [[Cottage of Lost Play]], where [[Eriol]], the [[Men|Mannish]] mariner who found Tol Eressëa, stayed for a while.<ref name=\"Cot\"/> There, he heard many tales of the history of the Elves and the [[Valar]], told to him by the inhabitants of Kortirion, including [[Lindo]], the lord of the Cottage of Lost Play, his wife [[Vairë (wife of Lindo)|Vairë]],<ref>{{LT1|I}}, pp. 14-5</ref> [[Rúmil (elf of Tirion)#Other versions of the legendarium|Rúmil]], the old door-ward of the Cottage, and [[Littleheart]], son of [[Voronwë]].<ref>{{LT1|II}}, p. 46</ref>\n\nAfter a while, he also went to the home of [[Meril-i-Turinqi]], the Lady of Tol Eressëa, who lived at the foot of the tower of Ingil (her grandfather<ref>{{LT1|V}}, p. 129</ref>), amidst a ''[[korin]]'' of [[elms]].<ref>{{LT1|IV}}, p. 95</ref> There, she told him the story of ''[[the Chaining of Melko]]'',<ref>{{LT1|IV}}, p. 98</ref> and ''[[the Coming of the Elves and the Making of Kôr]]''.<ref>{{LT1|V}}, p. 113</ref>\n\nBefore winter came to Kortirion that year, Eriol also visited many of the homes of the [[Vanyar#Other versions of the legendarium|Teleri]] and the [[Inwir]]<ref group=\"note\">According to one text, the Inwir are said to have spoken [[Inwelin]], a more archaic form of [[Qenya|Telellin]].</ref><ref>{{PE|12}}, p. 1</ref> (the royal clan of the Teleri), who lived there, and learned more of the language, history and customs of the Elves.<ref>{{LT2|I}}, p. 4</ref>\n\n=== The Faring Forth ===\nSometime during the [[wikipedia:5th century|5th century AD]],<ref>{{LT1|In}}, p. 23</ref> when the disastrous [[Faring Forth]] took place, and the island of Tol Eressëa was dragged across the Ocean and anchored off the coast of the [[Great Lands]], Men invaded the island, along with [[Orcs]], [[Trolls]] and other evil beings.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''5''', p. 283</ref> In the ensuing destruction, Kortirion was one of the places that were ravaged by Men from the Great Lands, with the Elves of Kortirion fleeing from them, and eventually fading away.<ref>{{LT1|In}}, p. 26</ref><ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''9''', p. 289</ref>\n\nHowever, not all Men were hostile to the Elves, and these were led by [[Heorrenda]], [[Hengest and Horsa]], the sons of Eriol.<ref name=\"War\">{{LT2|VI}}, p. 293</ref> Kortirion itself was later conquered by Hengest, and became known as ''Warwíc'' (in the [[Old English|language]] of his people).<ref name=\"Guo\"/>\n\nThe city would eventually become known as ''Warwick''.<ref name=\"War\"/>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''Kortirion'' is in [[Qenya]]. It is comprised of ''[[Kôr]]'' (the name of the ancient elven city in Valinor) + ''[[tirion (Qenya word)|tirion]]'' (\"(great or mighty) tower; city on a hill\").<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2015993001.html|articlename=ᴱQ. ''Kortirion'' loc.|website=Eldamo|accessed=6 May 2022}}</ref>\n\nIn the etymology of Tolkien's earliest languages, the name of the hill of [[Kôr]] refers to its roundness. It is derived from the primitive Elvish name ''[[Guord]]'', from which came Qenya ''[[Qora]]'', and Gnomish ''[[Gwar (Gnomish name)|Gwar]]''.<ref name=\"Guo\">{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''13''', pp. 291-2</ref>\n\n== Other names ==\nThe [[Gnomish]] cognates of ''Kortirion'' are, depending on the text, either '''''Corthirion'''''<ref name=\"Cor\"/><ref>{{PE|15}}, \"[[Names and Required Alterations]]\", p. 7</ref> or '''''Mindon Gwar'''''<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-404487345.html|articlename=G. ''Mindon Gwar'' loc.|website=Eldamo|accessed=7 April 2022}}</ref> (with '''''Gwarmindon''''' being the hypothetical true cognate of ''Kortirion''). Both Qenya and Gnomish names mean \"Tower of Kôr\". It was also called the '''''Citadel of the Island''''' or the '''''Citadel of the World''''', by \"those that speak of it with love\".<ref name=\"Cot\"/>\n\n[[Christopher Tolkien]] notes that his father intended to relate the Gnomish form ''gwar-'' with the first element of ''War''wick ([[Welsh]]: Caer''gwar''), suggesting it to be Elvish in origin.<ref name=\"Guo\"/>\n\nThe city was also called '''''Kormas''''' or '''''Koromas''''', meaning \"the Resting of the Exiles of [[Kôr]]\" in Qenya, being a combination of ''Kôr'' + the suffix ''[[-mas]]'' (\"-ton, -by\"; i.e. town).<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1477624403.html|articlename=ᴱQ. ''Kor(o)mas'' loc.|website=Eldamo|accessed=7 April 2022}}</ref> Its Gnomish cognate is '''''Corangos''''' (changed from an earlier form ''Cormath''<ref>{{PE|15}}, \"[[Names and Required Alterations]]\", p. 9</ref>).<ref name=\"Cor\">{{PE|11}}, p. 26</ref>\n\nIt was also called '''''New Kôr'''''.<ref>{{PE|14}}, p. 60</ref>\n\nIn [[Old English]], the city was called '''''Warwíc'''''.<ref name=\"Guo\"/>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\n=== Early legendarium ===\nIn some of the outlines for the continuation of ''The Book of Lost Tales'', [[Tolkien]] decided to completely change the nature of the framework of the tales.\n\nIn that reimagining of the [[legendarium]], Tol Eressëa ceased to be identified with [[wikipedia:England|England]]/[[wikipedia:British Isles|British Isles]] - instead, it became a completely different island, and [[wikipedia:Great Britain|Great Britain]] became the island of [[Luthany]], while the mariner that came to Tol Eressëa was called [[Ælfwine]], an [[wikipedia:English people|Englishman]] sailing ''from'' England/Luthany.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, pp. 300-1</ref>\n\nSo, as opposed to the previous conception, where the Elves of the Great Lands sailed directly to Tol Eressëa following the defeat of [[Melko]] in the [[March of Liberation]], the Elves now sailed to Luthany instead.\n\nThere, they built many cities and settlements - and, after their ''eventual'' return to Tol Eressëa, named many places there ''after'' the ones in Luthany. For example, the city of Kortirion (the New) in Tol Eressëa was named after '''Kortirion the Old''' (i.e. Warwick) in Luthany.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''27''', pp. 307-8</ref>\n\nIn one note, the capital city of Tol Eressëa where Ælfwine was brought to is called '''[[Rôs#Other versions of the legendarium|Rôs]]'''.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''16''', pp. 301-2</ref> However, other notes continue to have Ælfwine come to Kortirion (the New) instead.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''17''', p. 302</ref>\n\n==== ''Ælfwine of England'' ====\nIn the text called ''[[Ælfwine of England]]'' (c. [[1920]]) from ''The Book of Lost Tales'', Kortirion (the Old) appears as a city in [[Luthany]] (here called '''''Lúthien'''''<ref group=\"note\">For the many uses of the name ''Lúthien'' in the legendarium, see [[Lúthien (disambiguation)]].</ref>).\n\nIt was ruled by the [[Prince of Gwar]] named [[Óswine (prince of Gwar)|Óswine]], who was friendly to the Elves that still lived on the island. In that city also dwelt the [[Minstrels|minstrel]] [[Déor (father of Ælfwine)|Déor]], along with his wife [[Éadgifu]] of [[Lionesse]] and their son Ælfwine.\n\nWhile Ælfwine was still a boy, a fierce people called the [[Forodwaith (The Book of Lost Tales)|Forodwaith]] (i.e. [[wikipedia:Vikings|Vikings]]) laid siege to the city, during which Óswine, the Prince of Gwar died, as well as Déor and Éadgifu, Ælfwine's parents.<ref>{{LT2|VIb}}, pp. 313-4</ref>\n\n=== Later legendarium ===\nIn the later version of the legendarium from the [[1930]], in the preamble to ''[[Quenta Noldorinwa]]'', '''Kortirion''' was mentioned as a city in Tol Eressëa where [[Ælfwine|Eriol]] saw and read the ''[[Golden Book]]'', which formed the basis for his writing of the ''Book of Lost Tales''.<ref>{{SM|Q0}}, pp. 77-8</ref>\n\nThe city of '''Cortirion''' in Tol Eressëa also appears in the conclusion to the [[1937]] ''[[Quenta Silmarillion (Lost Road)|Quenta Silmarillion]]'', where it is stated that [[Ælfwine]] alone of all [[Men]] \"brought tidings of Cortirion to the [[Middle-earth|Hither Lands]]\".<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, \"The Conclusion of the ''Quenta Silmarillion''\", §33, p. 334</ref>\n\n== Inspiration ==\nThe city of Kortirion was inspired by the town of [[wikipedia:Warwick|Warwick]] in [[wikipedia:England|England]], where [[Edith Bratt]] lived from [[1913]] until her marriage with [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] in [[1916]], and where Tolkien visited her from [[Oxford]].<ref name=\"Ala\">{{LT1|In}}, pp. 24-5</ref>\n\nThe Gliding Water which flows through Kortirion was probably inspired by the river [[wikipedia:River Avon, Warwickshire|Avon]], which flows through Warwick.<ref>[[John Garth]], ''[[The Worlds of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', \"Rivers, Lakes and Waterlands\", p. 108</ref>\n\nTirin na Gilweth, the tower of Ingil, might have been inspired by a tower which, according to legend, once stood on Ethelfleda's Mound in [[wikipedia:Warwick Castle|Warwick Castle]].<ref>[[John Garth]], ''[[The Worlds of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', \"The Land of Lúthien\", pp. 48-9</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*''[[The Trees of Kortirion]]'' (poem)\n\n{{references|notes}}\n[[Category:Cities, towns and villages]]\n[[Category:Locations in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Luthany]]\n[[Category:Qenya locations]]\n[[Category:Tol Eressëa]]\n[[de:Kortirion]]\n[[fi:Kortirion]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/villes tours et forteresses/tol eressea/kortirion]]"}}}
