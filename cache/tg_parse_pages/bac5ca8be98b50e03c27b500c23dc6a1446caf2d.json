He was born in {{SR|1179}}, the middle child, between his brothers [[Madoc Brandybuck|Madoc]] and [[Marroc Brandybuck|Marroc]]. He has three children, of which the daughter, [[Salvia Brandybuck|Salvia]], was born in {{SR|1226}}.<ref>{{App|Brandybuck}}</ref>\n\n==Etymolgy==\nThe meaning of the name ''Sadoc'' is unknown. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] noted that the names of the Bucklanders had a vaguely [[Celtic]] style.<ref name=\"Translation\">{{App|Translation}}, p. 1135</ref>\n\nA Cornish knight named ''Sadoc'' who becomes a Knight of the Round Table and a knight of Orkney named ''Sadoc'' appear in Malory's ''Le Morte Darthur''. There also exists the [[Welsh]] name ''Cadoc'' that is derived from ''cad'' (\"battle\").<ref name=\"Allan\">{{HM|IE}}, \"Giving of Names\", p. 204</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nTwo knights called ''Sadoc'' play a role in Malory's ''Le Morte Darthur'': a ''Sadoc'' who is a Cornish knight who is friendly to Sir Tristram and a ''Sadoc'' who is a knight of Orkney.<ref name=\"Allan\"/> ''Cadoc'' is also the name of a Welsh [[Wikipedia:Cadoc|saint]].\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Brandybuck]]\n[[Category:Hobbits]]"}}}
