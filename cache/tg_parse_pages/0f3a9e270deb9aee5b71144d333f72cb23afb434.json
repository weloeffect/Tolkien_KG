They search amongst the bodies and find a belt belonging to one of the hobbits. [[Legolas]] whispers a lament for them, and, in frustration, [[Aragorn]] kicks a helmet and settles down to his knees. From there he begins reading the tracks of the hobbits in the ground. Following their tracks, he finds their bonds were cut and they escaped into [[Fangorn Forest]]. \n{{blockquote|Fangorn?
