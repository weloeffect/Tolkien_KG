At last its profound symbolism is made  clear in light of the Hermetic tradition, establishing ''The Lord of the  Rings'' as the work of an illuminated imagination.  Alchemy in  Middle-earth traces J.R.R. Tolkien's motifs to unexpected  connections with Scotland, the Middle East, and legendary Atlantis, unveiling the ancient wisdom in Tolkien's great work not only with  the Alchemy of the past, but also with the living mystical alchemy  of Sufism.  In the process, the mysterious relationship between the  spirituality of Islam and Tolkien's Christianity is revealed,  signifying nothing less than the completion of the Grail quest at the end of an age.\n\n\nMahmoud Shelton studied at the University of Edinburgh  before taking a degree in Medieval Studies at Stanford University.  He has travelled in search of Hermeticism's legacy from the Western Mediterranean to the Far East. Shelton has \nnumerous magazine articles to his credit, and was a contributor to ''The Royal Book of Spiritual Chivalry''.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.templeofjustice.net/contents/contents.html|articlename=Alchemy in Middle-earth: Contents|dated=|website=[http://www.templeofjustice.net/ Templeofjustice.net]|accessed=18 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Religious books]]"}}}
