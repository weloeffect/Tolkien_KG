He took possession of [[Húrin]]'s lands and was eventually slain by [[Túrin]].\n\n== History ==\nDuring the [[First Age]], after Morgoth captured the land of [[Hithlum]], Brodda was made a lord. He took to wife (against her will) [[Aerin]] of the [[House of Hador]], a kinswoman of Húrin, and took Húrin's lands and possessions.<ref>{{CH|4}}, p. 68</ref> When in {{FA|495}}<ref>{{GA|288}}</ref> Túrin, son of Húrin, returned to Dor-lómin, he learned from Aerin that his mother, [[Morwen]], had left [[Hithlum]]. In his rage he killed Brodda, thereby also sealing Aerin's fate, who burnt herself alive in her [[Brodda's hall|hall]], and the remainder of the [[House of Hador]] now was persecuted even more cruelly.<ref>{{CH|12}}, pp. 188-90</ref>\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| | | | | IND | |IND=[[Indor]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | | | |!| | |}}\n{{familytree| BRO |~| AER | |BRO='''BRODDA'''<br /><small>''d. {{FA|496}}''</small>|AER=[[Aerin]]<br /><small>''d. {{FA|496}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nBrodda already appears in the earliest version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. The concept of the Easterlings invading [[Hisilómë]] was not present, but he is the lord of those lands inhabited by [[Men]], as well as a horrible husband for [[Airin]]. When [[Mavwin]] decided to leave Hisilómë and asked to Airin that Brodda took care of her properties, he accepted without problem. But once Mavwin and [[Nienóri]] left, he added all her goods to his own, and did not take care her house or lands, so he was considered a bad lord and thief by his own people. When [[Turambar]] heard about this, became enraged and went to [[Brodda's hall]]. Airin was not there, but he was welcomed to the dinner party that was taking place, although he rejected the food they offered to him.\n\n{{blockquote|Then Turambar stepping out into the midst of them before the high place where Brodda sat said: \"Behold, I am Turambar son of the forest\", and men laughed thereat, but Turambar's eyes were full of wrath. Then said Brodda in doubt: \"What wilt thou of me, O son of the wild forest?\" But Turambar said: \"Lord Brodda, I am come to repay thy stewardship of others' goods,\" and silence fell in that place; but Brodda laughed, saying again: \"But who art thou?\" And thereupon Turambar leapt upon the high place and ere Brodda might foresee the act he drew [[Gurtholfin]] and seizing Brodda by the locks all but smote his head from off his body, crying aloud: \"So dieth the rich man who addeth the widow's little to his much. Lo, men die not all in the wild woods, and am I not in truth the son of [[Úrin]], who having sought back unto his folk findeth an empty hall despoiled.\"}}\n\nSeeing Turambar's crime, people in the hall revolted. Some did not appreciated Brodda and did not even unsheath their swords, but others attacked Turambar, of which [[Orlin]] was killed. Airin appeared and stopped everyone. She was shocked because of the crime commited, but spoke a favorable judgement against Turambar, recognizing how unfair Brodda had been towards Mavwin. Everyone approved, ignoring how horrible was Airin's life beside that man.<ref>{{LT2|II}}, pp. 89-91, 93</ref>\n\n== See also==\n* [[Lorgan]], another Easterling that was made lord in Hithlum\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Children of Húrin]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:Easterlings (First Age)]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Rulers in the Great Lands]]\n[[Category:Servants of Melkor]]\n[[de:Brodda]]\n[[fi:Brodda Itäläinen]]"}}}
