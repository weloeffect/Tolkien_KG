Tolkien's Letters to Rhona Beare''''' is a reproduction of two letters by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] to scholar [[Rhona Beare]] in their original form. They were printed in ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'' with some editorial changes and omissions.\n\n* [[Letter to Rhona Beare (14 October 1958)]] (corresponds to [[Letter 211]])\n* [[Letter to Rhona Beare (8 June 1961)]] (corresponds to [[Letter 230]])\n\nThe booklet was distributed to members of the New England Tolkien Society. 95 copies were printed, each numbered by hand in ink.<ref name=db>[[Wayne G. Hammond]], [[Douglas A. Anderson]] (1993), ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography]]'': Di2</ref>\n\n==Changes in the ''Letters''==\n* Compared to the letter of [[14 October]] [[1958]], Letter 211 omitted some marginal comments, replaced a paragraph with one from a draft (on the same point), and provided a prefatory note summarizing Dr. Beare's questions to which the letter is a response.\n\n* Compared to the letter of [[8 June]] [[1961]], Letter 230 omitted its first two paragraphs and final paragraph. The second paragraph is a translation of the [[A Elbereth Gilthoniel|Elvish hymn to Elbereth]] in ''The Lord of the Rings'', which differs in detail from the literal translation given in ''[[The Road Goes Ever On (book)|The Road Goes Ever On]]''.<ref name=db/>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[The Letters of J.R.R.
