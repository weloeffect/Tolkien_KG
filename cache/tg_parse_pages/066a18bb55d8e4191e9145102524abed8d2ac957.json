It represented the [[Númenórean]] day ''[[Orbelain]]'', dedicated to the [[Valar]]. As such it was the chief day of the week and after noon [[Hobbits]] considered it a holiday with evening feasts.<ref name=cal>{{App|Calendars}}</ref>\n\nAfter the reform of [[Isengrim Took II]],<ref name=cal/> dates such as 1 [[Lithe]] and 1 [[Yule]] always fell on Highday. There was no month beginning with Highday, therefore it became a jesting idiom in the [[Shire]] to say \"on Friday the first (of [[Summerfilth]])\" when referring to a fictitious day or unlikely events.\n==Etymology==\n''Highday'' represents an archaic [[Hobbitish]] form \"Hihdei\", a word preserved in the [[Yellowskin]].<ref name=cal/>\n\n''Highday'' is translated as Friday in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', however as it was the chief day of the week, its cultural significance rather corresponded to that of our Sunday. For this reason, when the poem ''[[The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late]]'' mentions a special pair of silver spoons and plates reserved for \"Sunday\", it should rather be understood as Highday, rather than [[Sunday]].<ref name=cal/><ref>{{FR|Sign}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n{{Week}}\n[[Category:Hobbit Calendar]]"}}}
