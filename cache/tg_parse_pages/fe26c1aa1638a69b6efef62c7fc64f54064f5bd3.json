Tolkien's Correspondence with Arthur Ransome\" by Alaric Hall and Samuli Kaislaniemi.\n\n==From the publisher==\n\n{{blockquote|This collection of articles is a Festschrift for Leena Kahlas-Tarkka. In her long career Leena Kahlas-Tarkka has inspired and encouraged countless students with her teaching and the example she has set as a scholar. Her research merits include studies of the early development of English pronouns and verbs, the languages of the Salem witchcraft trials, and individual Early Modern thinkers and translators. The twenty-four articles in this volume cover four different areas of English studies: medieval scholarship, corpus studies, books and genres, and literary perspectives. Together they represent a modern take on philology at work, combining new methods and approaches with a traditional sensibility for the social, cultural and biographical issues that inform the linguist and literary scholar of today.}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/78192/1/Hall%26Kaislaniemi_editorille.pdf \"You Tempt me Grievously to a Mythological Essay\" (online version)] at White Rose Research Online\n*[http://dimitrafimi.com/on-hobbits-and-poetry-musings-on-newly-published-letters-by-tolkien/ On Hobbits and Poetry: Musings on Newly Published Letters by Tolkien] by [[Dimitra Fimi]]\n\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]"}}}
