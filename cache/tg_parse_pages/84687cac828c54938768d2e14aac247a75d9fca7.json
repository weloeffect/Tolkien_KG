Each scene is explored in four different ways: a closer look at the plot and the action, a look behind the scenes, a reveal of mistakes that slipped through, and audience reactions. In addition to covering the stunning Peter Jackson trilogy and other adaptions (including the animated adaptations), details are also revealed about the prequel films currently in production, making this an essential volume for any Lord of the Rings fan.}}\n\n==External links==\n\n*[http://www.facebook.com/lordofthefilms Official Facebook page]\n*[http://www.workingauthor.com/the-lord-of-the-films-book-review Review of ''The Lord of the Films'']\n\n{{references}}\n{{title|italics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lord of the Film, The}}\n[[Category:Film books]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
