'''''únati''''') is a [[Quenya]] noun meaning \"a thing impossible to be or to be done\". The term refers to physical laws established by [[Ilúvatar]] that are impossible to break. The ''únati'' contrast with the ''[[axan]]i'', which are laws established by Ilúvatar that lesser beings should not, but can, disobey. [[Melkor]] refused to accept any ''axani'' as binding upon him, but he was unable to violate the ''únati'' much to his frustration. Since the ''únati'' remained, they were a perpetual reminder of the existence of Eru and His invincibility, which fed Melkor's unceasing and unappeasable rage.<ref>{{NM|P2ix}}, pp. 205-218</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word consists of the prefix ''ú-'', meaning \"not, un-, in- (usually with bad sense)\", and ''nat'', meaning \"thing\".<ref>{{VT|39b}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n{{title|lowercase}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Unat}}\n[[Category:Concepts]]\n[[Category:Quenya nouns]]"}}}
