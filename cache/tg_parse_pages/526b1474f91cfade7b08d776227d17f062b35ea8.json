Of older Entwives and Entmaidens he said the following:\n{{blockquote|[T]he Entwives were bent and browned by their labour; their hair parched by the sun to the hue of ripe corn and their cheeks like red apples. Yet their eyes were still the eyes of our own people.}}\n\nThe Entwives were described as desiring order, plenty and peace.<ref name=\"TT476\">{{TT|Treebeard}}, p. 476</ref> Treebeard said that they would have liked the lands of [[The Shire]].<ref>{{TT|Treebeard}}, p. 472</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ralph Damiani - Ancient Knowledge.jpg|250px|right|thumb|''Ancient Knowledge'' by [[:category:Images by Ralph Damiani|Ralph Damiani]]]]\nThe Entwives were created along with the male Ents by [[Yavanna]], the [[Valar|Vala]] responsible for all growing things. Unlike their husbands who were dedicated to [[Oromë]], the Entwives were dedicated to Yavanna.<ref>{{L|247}}</ref> They originally travelled with the Ents, but in the [[First Age]],<ref group=\"note\">The exact date of this is not told however it occurred before what Treebeard refers to as the [[The Darkness#Great Darkness|Great Darkness]], i.e. [[Morgoth]]'s dominion over [[Middle-earth]].</ref> they settled down and created gardens because they liked to plant and control small things like vegetables, grass and flowers, while the male Ents tended the larger [[trees]] of the forests. Unlike the Ents who wished to speak to the trees and let them grow however they'd like, the Entwives wanted to be obeyed by the plants for they desired order. The rest of the Ents kept on wandering, visiting the gardens occasionally.<ref name=\"TT476\" /> The Ents wished for the Entwives to return to them but they refused believing their land to be better.<ref name=\"TT477\">{{TT|Treebeard}}, p. 477</ref> When [[Morgoth]] started growing his power in the North, the Entwives passed eastward over the [[Anduin]]. After Morgoth was overthrown, their gardens blossomed and they taught agriculture to the primitive [[Men]] and were honoured by them.<ref name=\"TT476\" />\n\nTo stop the advance of the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|Last Alliance]] down the Anduin, [[Sauron]] pursued a scorched earth policy.<ref name=\"L144\" /> The Entwives' lands were burned and uprooted and thereafter Men referred to the land as the Brown Lands.<ref name=\"TT476\" />\n\n===Search for the Entwives===\nSometime during the [[War of the Last Alliance]], Treebeard desired to see his wife [[Fimbrethil]] but when he reached their lands he found them marred by war and the Entwives no longer there. For a long time, the Ents searched frequently for the Entwives asking all creatures if they had seen them. Some had not seen them, others said they were seen going east, some said west and others south.<ref name=\"TT476\" /> Many songs were sung by [[Elves]] and Men about the Ents' search for the Entwives. Over time their searches became more infrequent and they journeyed shorter distances until the Entwives were mere memory to most Ents.<ref name=\"TT476\" /> The loss of the Entwives had a large effect on the Ents as there were no new [[Entings]],<ref name=\"TT475\">{{TT|Treebeard}}, p. 475</ref> and survival of the Ents as a race was due only to their long lifespan but some Ents died and others became \"treeish\" until there were few Ents left.<ref>{{TT|Treebeard}}, pp. 474-5</ref>\n\n===Fate of the Entwives===\nThe Ents held that the Entwives were not dead but merely lost.<ref name=\"TT475\" /> They believed that they would one day find each other and hoped to go to a land where they could both be happy.<ref name=\"TT477\" />\n\nThe Entwives may have been wiped out by Sauron during the [[War of the Last Alliance]] but some could have fled east or become slaves of Sauron used for agriculture. If this were the case, any surviving Entwives would likely \"be far estranged from the Ents, and any rapprochement would be difficult\".<ref name=\"L144\">{{L|144}}</ref>\n\nSometime before the [[War of the Ring]], [[Halfast Gamgee]] claimed that he saw an [[Elms|elm]]-like \"[[Tree-men|Tree-man]]\" walking beyond the [[North Moors]].<ref>{{FR|Shadow}}, pp. 44-5</ref> However, it was never learned whether the \"Tree-man\" was an Ent, an Entwife, \"a [[Trolls|troll]]\"<ref name=\"unpublished\">[https://www.tolkienguide.com/guide/letters/544?q=tag%3AEntwives TCG Letter #544] on the Tolkien Collector Guide</ref> of some kind, or just a story.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2024: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'':'''\n:In Season 2, an Entwife named [[Winterbloom]] is introduced alongside her husband [[Snaggleroot]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Entmaidens]]\n*[[:Category:Images of Entwives|Images of Entwives]]\n*[[song of the Ent and Entwife]] (song/poem)\n*[[Letter 338]] - Letter discussing the fate of the Entwives.\n*[[Letter 144]] - Letter discussing the fate of the Entwives.\n\n==External links==\n*[[User:Ardamir/Essays/Entwives|Of the Ents and the Entwives]] - An essay on the location of the Entwives by [[User:Ardamir|Ardamir]].\n*[http://tolkien.slimy.com/tfaq/EnemyMisc.html#Entwives What became of the Entwives?] from the [[Tolkien FAQ]].\n*[http://www.tolkiensociety.org/blog/2017/05/yes-but-is-it-canon/ Yes, but is it canon?] - An article about a map that Tolkien may have labelled with the Entwives' location.\n\n{{references|notes}}\n\n[[Category:Ents]]\n[[de:Entfrauen]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/ents/ents-femmes]]\n[[fi:Entvaimot]]"}}}
