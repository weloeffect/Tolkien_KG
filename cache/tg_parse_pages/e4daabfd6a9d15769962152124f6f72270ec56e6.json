They were seen as well to do and respectable, as well as very predictable, for it was said one could tell what a Baggins would say on any occasion without even the bother of asking him.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{H|1}}</ref> They had many connections to other aristocratic Hobbit families, like the [[Brandybucks]] and the [[Tooks]]; other branches were the [[Sackville-Baggins Family|Sackville-Bagginses]] and the [[Chubb-Baggins Family|Chubb-Bagginses]].\n\nAlthough generally speaking they never had any adventures or did anything unexpected,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> its members with [[Took Family|Took]] blood were more adventurous. A notable example was [[Bilbo Baggins]] who set out on the quest for [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] with [[Gandalf]] the Grey and thirteen [[Dwarves]]; during his absence he was presumed dead and the headship of the family was in doubt, with [[Otho Sackville-Baggins|Otho]] of the Sackville-Baggins branch having the ambition of being head of two major families, until Bilbo returned alive.<ref name=fr1>{{FR|I1}}</ref><ref name=l214>{{L|214}}</ref> He was seen as odd or queer, but also extremely rich.\n\nBilbo adopted his \"nephew\" [[Frodo Baggins]], who inherited the ''[[Smials|smial]]'' of [[Bag End]] (which did not sit well with Otho<ref name=fr1/>) after Bilbo left. Frodo himself was involved in the quest which ended the [[War of the Ring]].\n\nOther Bagginses include the descendants of [[Posco Baggins]], as well as [[Peregrin Took]] and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]], who had maternal Baggins blood.\n\nIn {{SR|1421}} both Bilbo and Frodo went over [[the Sea]] but it was still impossible to presume death, so when [[Samwise Gamgee]] was elected [[Mayor of the Shire]], he established a rule of succession and inheritance in such situations. Presumably [[Ponto Baggins II]] became the head of the family.<ref name=l214/>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{baggins}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name Baggins is a translation in English of the actual [[Westron]] name ''[[Labingi]]'', which was believed to be related to the Westron word ''[[laban]]'', \"bag\". The name is associated with '''[[Bag End]]'''.<ref name=\"Nomen\">{{HM|N}}, p. 753</ref>\n\nThe name Baggins is translated in most translations of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', often keeping the \"bag\" or \"sack\" meaning:<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), \"Guide to the Names in ''The Lord of the Rings''\", published in ''[[A Tolkien Compass]]'' (edited by [[Jared Lobdell]]), entry ''Baggins''</ref>\n*In the Breton translation it is ''Sac'heg''.\n*In the Cornish translation it is ''Baggyn''.\n*In the Czech translation it is ''Pytlík''.\n*In the Dutch translation it is ''Balings''.\n*In the Estonian translation it is ''Paunaste''.\n*In the Finnish translation it is ''Reppuli''.\n*In the French translation it is ''Sacquet'' in most books, but ''Bessac'' in the new ''Hobbit'' translation.\n*In the Frisian translation it is ''Balsma''.\n*In the German translation the family name is ''Beutlin''.\n*In the Hungarian translation it is ''Zsákos''.\n*In the Norwegian translation it is ''Lommelun''.\n*In one of the Polish translations it is ''Bagosz''.\n*In the Portuguese translation it is ''Bolseiro''.\n*In the Slovak translation it is ''Bublík''.\n*In the Slovene translation it is ''Bisagin''.\n*In the Spanish translation it is ''Bolsón''.\n*In the Swedish translation it is ''Secker''; ''Bagger'' in the old translation by Åke Ohlmarks.\n<!-- Feel free to add more -->\n\n==Inspiration==\n{{quote|Intended to recall bag — cf.
