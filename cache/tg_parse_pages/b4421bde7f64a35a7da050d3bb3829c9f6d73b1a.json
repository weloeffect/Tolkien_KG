Tolkien]] wrote ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. In the [[The First Map of The Lord of the Rings|First Map of The Lord of the Rings]] the Ringló flowed to the sea and the Morthond was set well west of it (and [[Dol Amroth]] was far to the west of both).<ref>{{TI|MIII}}</ref> When he developed Outline VI for Book V in ''[[The Return of the King]]'' he drew a map that showed the Morthond east of the Ringló and the Ringló mostly flowed south to the Sea.<ref>{{WR|3|II}}</ref> When Tolkien made the detailed [[The Second Map of The Lord of the Rings|Second Map]] there were four rivers – [[Calenhir]], Morthond, Kiril (later Ciril), and Ringló – that flowed independently until they all met just before exiting into Cobas Haven.<ref name=\"Map2\"/>\n\nIn two earlier versions of a note about the element ''ló'' in the name ''Gwathló'', it is mentioned that the Ringló formed marshes or a fenland after its confluence with the river Morthond as the reason for the element ló in the name Ringló. The second revised version mentioned that the river was named Ringnen after its source and later renamed Ringló, because it formed a fenland near its confluence with the Morthond. J.R.R. Tolkien later struck out the fenland as the explanation for the lement ''ló '' and stated in the final version that there is no record of any swamps or marsh in the course of the Ringló, but retained that the river was named after its source and explained it as mentioned above.<ref name=NM/><ref name=Rivers/>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2014: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Ringló originates in the \"Ringló Vale\" area of the Central [[Gondor]] in-game region, flowing through [[Ethring]] before entering [[Lamedon]] proper.\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ringlo}}\n[[Category:Gondor]]\n[[Category:Rivers]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[de:Ringló]]\n[[fi:Ringló]]"}}}
