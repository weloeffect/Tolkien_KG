The Teleri (who were later called by the epithet the ''Swanherds'')<ref>{{MR|P3I3}} (§30)</ref> thus especially came to revere swans, and named their city [[Alqualondë]] (the Swanhaven) and built their [[Swan-ships|ships in swan-form]].<ref>{{S|5}}</ref><ref>{{SM|Q3}}</ref><ref>{{MR|P3I5}}</ref>\n\nOssë's master [[Ulmo]], the [[Vala]], sent seven great swans to guide [[Tuor]] to [[Vinyamar]], where he found a shield which had \"an emblem of a white swan's wing\". Tuor already loved these birds, having been fostered at [[Mithrim]], where swans seem to have been plentiful (and Tuor's foster-father, [[Annael]] and [[Elves of Mithrim|his folk]], had the swan as a symbol). Departing from Vinyamar, Ulmo's seven swans approached Tuor and offered him one feather each, which Tuor set in the crest of his helm.<ref>{{S|23}}</ref><ref>{{UT|1}}, pp. 25-28</ref>\n\nThe Teleri were not alone in using the swan-form in ship-building: the prow of [[Eärendil]]'s ship [[Vingilótë]] \"''was fashioned like a swan''\",<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}, \"''[[Eärendillinwë]]''\"</ref> and the Elves of [[Lothlórien]] made a [[Swan-ships|Swan-ship]], so well crafted that it resembled a real, giant swan.<ref>{{FR|Farewell}}</ref> \n[[Image:Ted Nasmith - Farewell to Lórien.jpg|thumb|right|''Farewell to Lórien'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nIn the [[Third Age]], the symbol of the [[swan-knights]] of [[Dol Amroth]] was a banner, silver upon blue, bearing a \"token of the [[Ship and the Silver Swan]]\", and their mariners used swan-prowed ships.<ref>{{RK|MT}}</ref><ref>{{RK|Siege}}</ref><ref>{{RK|Cormallen}}</ref>\n\n==Other names==\nIn [[Sindarin]], the name for \"swan\" was ''[[alph]]'' (pl.

Later, the wing of a white swan became the symbol for Tuor and his company ([[House of the Wing]]) in [[Gondolin]].<ref>{{LT2|III}}</ref>\n:''See also [[House of the Swan]]''\n\n==Inspiration==\nIn a poem about [[Tom Bombadil]], it is said that Tom \"''wore in his tall hat a swan-wing feather''\".<ref>{{AB|Tom}}</ref> [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] explained in a letter to [[Pauline Baynes]] that the swan, (traditionally the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan#Role_in_culture property of the King]), indicated a \"''special friendship with Tom''\", the swans being among the creatures \"''who looked for the return of their rightful Lord, the true King''\".<ref>{{L|240}}</ref> Perhaps this perceived nobility of the swans explains why Tolkien used the bird as a symbol for the princely line of Dol Amroth, and why the swans were described as allies of the [[Ainur]] and [[Elves]].\n\nA glimpse of Tolkien's childhood experience with swans has also been described: \n\n{{blockquote|...they [Ronald and Hilary] would scamper away from the yard, and run round to a place behind the mill [at [[Sarehole]]] where there was a silent pool with swans swimming on it.|[[Humphrey Carpenter]], ''[[J.R.R.
