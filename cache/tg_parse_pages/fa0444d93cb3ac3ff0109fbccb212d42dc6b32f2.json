These include the Corcur of the [[Trollshaws]] and the [[Misty Mountains]] (descendants of the Men of Rhudaur), the Créoth of the [[Lone-lands]], and the Trév Duvardain of [[Angmar]]. A second tribe of Angmar, the Trév Gállorg, are shown to be friendly towards the [[Free Peoples]]. These tribal names are original to the game and do not exist in the works of Tolkien.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Men]]\n[[Category:Pre-Númenóreans]]\n[[Category:Servants of Sauron]]\n[[de:Bergmenschen]]\n[[fi:Vuorilaiset]]"}}}
