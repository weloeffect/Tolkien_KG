Those who took the Nine Rings became the [[Nazgûl]].\n\n==History==\nThe Nine Rings were made along with the other Rings of Power in [[Eregion]] and were forged by [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain|Elven smiths]] under the guidance of [[Sauron]].<ref name=Rings>{{S|Rings}}</ref> They were kept in the [[House of the Mírdain]], but all rings save the [[Three Rings|Three Elven rings]] were captured by [[Sauron]] when he [[Sack of Eregion|attacked Eregion]].<ref>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref> He gave nine of them to Men, and it was said that three of those that received them were [[Númenórean]] lords,<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> and [[Khamûl|another]] was from the [[East]].<ref name=Black>{{UT|Black}}</ref>\n\nThe owners of the Nine were corrupted, amassing glory and riches, and becoming great among Men. They had the ability to become invisible, and their lives were extended unnaturally, until they fell at last to the power of [[the One Ring]] held by Sauron. They became part of the [[Unseen|wraith-world]], permanently invisible, and were enslaved by Sauron. They were afterwards his greatest servants, terrible to behold, known as the [[Nazgûl]].<ref name=Rings/>\n\nDuring the end of the [[Third Age]], Sauron had apparently reclaimed the Nine Rings to himself.<ref  name=Shadow>{{FR|Shadow}} \"the Nine he [Sauron] has gathered to himself; the Seven also, or else they are destroyed.\"</ref><ref name=Mirror>{{FR|Mirror}} \"You saw the Eye of him that holds the Seven and the Nine.\"</ref>\n\n==Disputed Ownership==\nIn ''[[The Council of Elrond]]'', [[Gandalf]] indicates that the [[Nazgûl]] kept their Rings by saying, \"The Nine the Nazgûl keep\".<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref> However in many other references, it is indicated that Sauron later held the Nine Rings.<ref name=Shadow/><ref name=Mirror/><ref>{{UT|Other}} \"[the Ringwraiths] were entirely enslaved to their Nine Rings, which he [Sauron] now himself held\"</ref> Furthermore, Frodo does not see any Rings on them on [[Weathertop]], and it is believed that if they did wear the Rings, they would have been fully [[Unseen|invisible]] (including their cloaks).<ref name=faq>{{webcite|author=Stan Brown|articleurl=https://brownmath.com/general/ringfaq.htm#Q79-SauronHeld|articlename=Were the Nazgûl wearing their Rings at the time of ''The Lord of the Rings''?|website=FAQ of the Rings|accessed=6 April 2024}}</ref>\n\nIt is possible that the line in the Council of Elrond represents Tolkien's earlier intention that the Nazgûl should still be wearing their Rings; if that is so, he later changed his mind and simply missed revising that sentence.<ref name=faq/>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===The Nine Rings in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings (1978 film) - Nine for mortal Men.png|The Nine Rings - [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy - The Nine.jpg|The Nine Rings - ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''\nFile:Decipher - Ring of Savagery.jpg|The Ring of Savagery in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]''\nFile:Decipher - Ring of Terror.jpg|The Ring of Terror in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]''\n</gallery>\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''\n:The Nine Kings are shown holding the Nine Rings in the prologue. \n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'':'''\n:Two of the Rings are named in the ''Rise of Saruman'' expansion: The Ring of Savagery<ref> ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'' - ''Rise of Saruman'': [https://www.ccgtrader.net/card/102215/ring-of-savagry Ring of Savagery]</ref> and the Ring of Terror.<ref> ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'' - ''Rise of Saruman'': [https://www.ccgtrader.net/card/102216/ring-of-terror Ring of Terror]</ref>\n'''2017: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Nine Rings are named as \"Orôm, the Warmonger\", \"Sâkhla, the Cruel One\", and \"Adâsh, the Foe-maker\", given to the Lieutenant of Dol Guldur and two other Easterling rulers, respectively; \"Jûru, the Herald of Mourning\", \"Mêbat, the Mirth-eater\", and \"Khânto, the Pain-giver\", given to [[Haradrim]]; and \"Sapthân, the Foolstone\", \"Nitîr, Terror's Sting\", and \"Ûri, the Heart-stopper\", given to Númenóreans, the third of whom became the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]].\n\n'''2017: ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]]'':'''\n:In a number of departures from the canon, a few of the Nine are shown to have had multiple bearers. These include a revived [[Isildur]] and [[Talion]], the game's main protagonist; Suladân, an original character; and original characters Riya and Yuka, sisters who killed their rings' previous owners and claimed them only to become wraiths themselves. [[Helm Hammerhand]] is also depicted as receiving one of the Nine from both Sauron and Celebrimbor in a clear breach of the timeline established in canon.\n\n{{references}}\n{{rings}}\n[[Category:Evil]]\n[[Category:Rings and jewels]]\n\n[[fr:encyclo/artefacts/bijoux/anneaux/neuf anneaux]]"}}}
