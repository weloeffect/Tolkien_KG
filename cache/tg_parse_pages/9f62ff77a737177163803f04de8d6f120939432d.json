They were originally paired with the [[Firebeards]]. The ancestor of the Broadbeams was among the oldest of the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves (together with the ancestors of the [[Firebeards]] and [[Longbeards]]).<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}, p. 301</ref>\n\nThe Broadbeams (with the Firebeards) awoke in the [[Blue Mountains]] and lived there throughout the history of their people. These two houses built the great Dwarven cities of [[Nogrod]] and [[Belegost]] in the Blue Mountains, and dwelt in them before their ruining in the [[War of Wrath]]. It is not clear whether they shared the two cities or whether each house dwelt in its own.<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref>  In an [[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two|earlier version of the legendarium]] the two cities are clearly inhabited by separate houses; however, Belegost is said to be the home of the [[Durin's Folk|Longbeards]].<ref name=\"#\">{{LT2|IV}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Second Age]], around the year {{SA|40|n}},<ref name=\"SA\">{{App|SA}}</ref> the Firebeards and Broadbeams who lived in Nogrod and Belegost left the destruction behind and came to [[Khazad-dûm]], increasing its wealth and power.<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>\n\nHowever, there always remained some Dwarves on the eastern side of the Blue Mountains in days afterwards.<ref>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n\n'''2002-5: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game]]'':'''\n: The House corresponding to the Broadbeams is called '''Linnar's Folk''', said to reside mainly in the Iron Hills during the late Third Age.<ref>{{D|M}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Broadbeams.jpg|thumb|left|The \"Landorrim\" in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2021: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n: The native [[Dwarves of the Blue Mountains]] were first introduced in the form of the villainous \"[[Dourhands|Dourhand]]\" clan, but a later update introduced the true House corresponding to the Broadbeams: the '''Landorrim''', \"''long allies of Durin's Folk''\". Their banners depict a tree with a think trunk and branches.\n\n: The [[Seven Rings|Ring]] of this House was either \"Úrya\" or \"Vanya\", both of which were devoured by the great [[Dragons|Worm]], \"Fingar the Greedy\", a survivor of the [[War of Wrath]].\n\n: At the start of the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]], the Landorrim and their King, \"Agni the Wild\", swiftly answered [[Thráin]]'s summons and marched from the Blue Mountains. Agni fell in the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] and was succeeded by his son \"Onúr\".\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dwarves of Belegost]]\n*[[Dwarves of Nogrod]]\n{{References}}\n{{Dwarvenclans}}\n[[de:Breitschultern]]\n[[fi:Väkivarret]]"}}}
