In [[Théoden]]'s day, some five centuries after the [[Ride of Eorl]], the full éoherë of [[Rohan]] was reckoned as one hundred [[éored]]s, or a total of twelve thousand fighting men.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, note 36</ref>\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''éoherë'' is [[Old English]] (''[[wiktionary:eoh#Old English|eoh]]'' + ''[[wiktionary:here#Old English|here]]''), and means (approximately) 'horse-host'.
