He held forth at The Ivy Bush, a small inn on the Bywater road; and he spoke with some authority, for he had tended the garden at Bag End for forty years, and had helped old Holman in the same job before that. Now that he was himself growing old and stiff in the joints, the job was mainly carried on by his youngest son, Sam Gamgee. Both father and son were on very friendly terms with Bilbo and Frodo. They lived on the Hill itself, in Number 3 Bagshot Row just below Bag End.|''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', \"[[A Long-expected Party]]\"}}</center>\n'''Hamfast Gamgee''', also known as '''the Gaffer''', was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of [[the Shire]], and the father of [[Samwise Gamgee]] of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]]. He was the gardener of [[Bag End]] before he passed the title onto Sam.\n==History==\n\nHamfast was born in {{TA|2926}}, the third son of [[Hobson|Hobson Gamgee]], who was a roper by trade. He had three siblings: [[Andwise Roper]], [[May (hobbit)|May]] and [[Halfred of Overhill]].<ref name=\"Gamgee\">{{App|Gamgee}}</ref>\n\nHe entered the service of his relative, \"[[Holman Greenhand|Cousin Holman]]\", and became a gardener. One of his first jobs was tending the garden of [[Bag End]].<ref name=party/> On [[22 June]], {{TA|2942}}, he and Holman frantically tried to keep the garden in order during the auction of the presumed-dead [[Bilbo Baggins]]. \n\nHamfast resided in Number 3, [[Bagshot Row]] and [[Daddy Twofoot]] was his next-door neighbor<ref name=party/> and had never been as far as [[Bucklebury]].<ref name=three/>\n\nHamfast became a gardener in his own right in about {{TA|2961}}, and a local expert on [[potatoes]] and other roots; \"Master Hamfast\" (as Bilbo called him) appreciated Bilbo's politeness and respecting his knowledge.<ref name=party>{{FR|Party}}</ref> He married [[Bell Gamgee|Bell Goodchild]], and they had six children: [[Hamson Gamgee|Hamson]], [[Halfred Gamgee|Halfred]], [[Daisy Gamgee|Daisy]], [[May Gamgee|May]], Samwise and [[Marigold Gamgee|Marigold]].<ref name=\"Gamgee\"/> Sam became Hamfast's apprentice.\n\nSam took over most of his father's work, who had become too old for the laborous work.<ref name=party/> He became known as the \"Gaffer\", a name Sam uses more often than \"Hamfast\".\n\nPrior to the [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|Farewell Party]], the younger [[hobbits]] sought information about the legendary Mr. Bilbo Baggins at the ''[[Ivy Bush]]''. Always a man of loquacity and knowledge, he argued with [[Sandyman]], [[Old Noakes]] and Daddy Twofoot about the [[Baggins Family|Bagginses]] and the [[Sackville-Baggins Family|Sackville-Bagginses]]. After the party, Bilbo left him two sacks of potatoes, a new spade, a woolen waistcoat, and a bottle of ointment as he suffered from creaking joints.<ref name=party/> By {{TA|3018}} he also began to lose his sight.<ref name=three/>\n\nIn {{TA|3018}}, his new neighbor, [[Frodo Baggins]] decided to leave the Shire, and [[Gandalf]] had obliged Sam to go with him. Frodo pretended to be moving to [[Buckland]], and sold Bag End to Lobelia, for which Hamfast was not so happy. He allowed Sam to go with Frodo to help and tend the garden of his new house, as he said.<ref name=three>{{FR|Three}}</ref>\n\nOn [[23 September]], the night of the departure of Frodo and Sam, [[Khamûl]]<ref name=Note1>{{UT|Hunt}}, Notes, note 1</ref>, one of the [[Nazgûl]] rode up the lane as the elderly hobbit was taking his air, and asked about \"[[Baggins Family|Baggins]]\". The Gaffer told him that he had left for [[Bucklebury]] and it's not their business to know why, and refused to leave any message. The stranger hissed, making Hamfast shudder. Soon after the Nazgûl left, Sam arrived to give Hamfast the keys to Bag End before leaving. Surprised by Sam's arrival, the Gaffer told Sam about the stranger.<ref name=three/> \n\n[[29 September|A week later]], he was visited by [[Gandalf]] who he also informed about Frodo's whereabouts.<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}</ref><ref>{{App|B3}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins|Lotho]] and eventually [[Sharkey]] took over the Shire, the Gaffer was evicted from Bagshot Row.<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref> After the [[Battle of Bywater]], in which he had only a marginal role, he moved back into the newly restored Bagshot Row, the \"[[New Row]].\" He was looked after by the [[Widow Rumble]], which Frodo uses to comfort Sam about moving into [[Bag End]]. After his [[Elanor Gardner|granddaughter]] is born, Sam calls his father to decide upon a name. Gaffer tells him to stick with the tradition of naming hobbit-girls after flowers and Frodo gives Sam the name \"Elanor\". The Gaffer lived for another 7 years and died in [[Fourth Age 7]].<ref>{{RK|Havens}}</ref>\n\nHis son, Sam, named his seventh child [[Hamfast Gardner|Hamfast]] after his father.<ref name=\"Gamgee\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Hamfast'' is a modernization of Old English ''hám-fæst'', meaning \"Stay-at-home\", or literally, \"Home-fast\". It is a translation of his [[Westron]] name, [[Ranugad]] [[Galbasi]].<ref>{{App|F2}}</ref> In the [[King's Letter]], the name (referring to [[Hamfast Gardner]], the fourth son of Sam and Rose, not the Gaffer) is translated into [[Sindarin]] as [[Baravorn]].<ref>{{SD|Epilogue}}</ref> \n\n\"[[Wiktionary:gaffer|Gaffer]]\" is a colloquial word for \"old man\". It is a contraction of \"grandfather.\"\n\n==In other stories==\nIn the illustrated short story ''[[Mr. Bliss]]'', there is a resident in the village named Gaffer Gamgee who struggles to listen to the discussion between Mr Binks and Sergeant [[Boffin Family|Boffin]] about whether Mr Bliss should be locked up for failure to pay for his car. Sergeant Boffin also has a son named [[Sam]].<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Mr. Bliss]]'' (2011 edition), p. 63</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nIn [[Letter 257]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] recounts a holiday to Lamorna Cave in the early 1930's. To amuse his sons, he named a local Gaffer Gamgee. This \"curious local character\" was \"an old man who used to go about swapping gossip and weather-fashion and such like\". The surname was chosen because it alliterated with Gaffer.\n \nTolkien had several encounters with actual Gamgees, however. [[wikipedia:Gamgee Tissue|Gamgee Tissue]], a word young Ronald considered comical, was named after [[wikipedia:Sampson Gamgee|J.

He used a thick peasant accent for the role. He is included in early episodes including a full dramatisation of his encounter with the Nazgul. Neither Frodo or Sam learn of this exchange. He also features towards the end of the adaptation when he admonishes the returning Hobbits for wearing \"ironmongery.\" The Gaffer also is present as the travelers discuss how Sam should use Galadriel’s gift.\n\n'''1992: [[Der Herr der Ringe (1992 German radio series)|''Der Herr der Ringe'' (1992 German radio series)]]:'''\n:Hamfast \"Gaffer\" Gamgee is played by Wolfgang Reinsch. \n\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''\n:Gaffer appears in the film's [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (extended edition)|Extended Edition]], where he is played by [[Norman Forsey]]. The conversation in the Ivy Bush is moved to the [[Green Dragon]] Inn, though the dialogue remains much the same. He does not appear at Sam's marriage in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]''.\n\n'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''\n:Gaffer appears twice; at first, he drinks at the Green Dragon, but during the night, he informs Frodo of the Ringwraith that stalks the Shire. He was voiced by an uncredited [[Jim Piddock]].\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Hamfast Gamgee is found working in his garden just outside Bag End. He only offers one regional Shire quest, but has more story involvement during various seasonal festivals.\n\n{{References|Notes}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:Fourth Age characters]]\n[[Category:Hobbits]]\n[[Category:Gamgee]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n\n[[de:Hamfast Gamdschie (Sohn von Hobsen)]]\n[[fi:Hamfast Gamgi (Ukko Gamgi)]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/hobbits/gamegie/hamfast gamegie 1]]"}}}
