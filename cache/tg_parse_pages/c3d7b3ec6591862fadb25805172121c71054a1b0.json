The building was three stories tall with many windows. Its front faced the Road and it had two wings that ran back towards the elevated ground of the hill, such that in the rear the second floor was at ground level.\n\nBetween the wings was a courtyard that was accessible through an archway. Under the arch a few steps on the left led to main door. Above the arch was a lamp that illuminated the sign beneath, which showed a fat pony rearing on its hind legs. A white-lettered inscription over the door announced \"The Prancing Pony by [[Barliman Butterbur]]\".\n\nIn the north wing there were rooms on the ground floor that had been especially built for [[hobbit]] guests. The centre of activity was the big common-room where drinks were served near a cheery log fire,<ref name=\"Pony\">{{FR|I9}}</ref> and lanterns were hanging on the roof beams.<ref>''[[Tolkien Calendar 2015]]'', June: 'The Inn at Bree', \"Miss Fairburn recalls that Tolkien told her the lanterns should be on the beams, not between them.\"</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Matěj Čadil - The Prancing Pony.jpg|thumb|left|''The Prancing Pony'' by [[Matěj Čadil]]]]\nThe Prancing Pony had been built long before the time of the [[War of the Ring]], when traffic on the roads had been much greater. Despite diminished numbers of visitors the inn had remained an important centre of news, since Bree was at the crossroads of the East Road and the [[Greenway]], which came up from the south and went onwards to [[Fornost Erain|Fornost]].<ref name=\"Pony\" />\n\nThe inn had been kept by the [[Butterbur Family]] for generations as a convivial gathering place for [[Men]], [[Dwarves]], and Hobbits (both those living in Bree and travellers from [[the Shire]]). [[Tobold Hornblower]] was one of the Shire Hobbits who visited Bree and probably the Prancing Pony, where he learned about [[Pipe-weed]].<ref name=\"Weed\">{{FR|Pipeweed}}</ref> Around {{TA|2670}} Old Toby brought back samples of the plant to the [[Southfarthing]]<ref name=\"TA\">{{App|TA}}</ref> where it became a major product of Hobbit agriculture, but the centre of the \"art\" of smoking remained at the old inn.<ref name=\"Weed\" />\n\nIt was perhaps in the ''Pony'' where the [[Wizards|Wizard]] [[Gandalf]] met Dwarven [[Kings of Durin's Folk|King-in-Exile]] [[Thorin]] [[Oakenshield]] in the spring of {{TA|2941}}. That meeting set the stage for the [[Quest of Erebor]].<ref name=\"UT9\">{{UT|9}}</ref><ref group=\"note\">Different accounts dispute the exact location of this first meeting. One source states that it occurred at an Inn in [[Bree]] whilst another states that Thorin started talking to Gandalf when he overtook him on the road.</ref> When [[Bilbo Baggins]] and the [[Thorin and Company|dwarves]] travelled eastward on their journey to the [[Lonely Mountain]] later that year,<ref name=\"TA\" /> it is very probable that they stayed at the Prancing Pony, although Bilbo did not specifically mention it in his memoir.<ref group=\"note\">See [[#Other versions of the legendarium]]</ref>\n\nAt the time of the [[War of the Ring]], the inn was owned and managed by Barliman Butterbur, a man who was somewhat absent-minded at times. He had two hobbit assistants, [[Nob]] and [[Bob]]. In [[Mid-year's Day]] {{TA|3018}} the inn was once again visited by Gandalf, who left Barliman [[Gandalf's letter|a letter]] for a [[Frodo Baggins]] in [[Hobbiton]]. Barliman did not find anyone willing to bring it to the Shire, and it was soon forgotten.<ref name=\"Strider\">{{FR|Strider}}</ref>\n\nOn the last [[Monday]] of [[September]] {{TA|3018}}<ref group=\"note\">In the [[Shire Calendar]] the last Monday of September always falls on [[26 September|26]], however the [[Bree Calendar]] did not necessarily follow this reform.</ref> two \"[[Nazgûl|black men]]\" knocked, asking Nob for one [[Baggins family|Baggins]]. Barliman noticed that their presence made the dogs and geese of the inn noisy and terrified Nob. He slammed the door on them, and later heard that they continued all the way to [[Archet]].<ref name=\"Strider\" />\n\nThe [[28 September|night before]] Frodo Baggins and his companions arrived another party (of men) came to the inn, travelling up the [[Greenway]] from the South.<ref name=\"Pony\" />\n\n[[File:Alan Lee - The Inn at Bree.jpg|thumb|''The Inn at Bree'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]\nOn [[29 September]] {{TA|3018}}, Frodo, [[Samwise Gamgee]], [[Peregrin Took]], and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] arrived at Bree and came to the Prancing Pony.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> The hobbits had followed Gandalf's instructions and expected to meet him there, but the Wizard was nowhere to be found. After supper in their room all except Merry went to the big common-room. It was here that \"[[Mr. Underhill]]\" (Frodo) first met [[Aragorn|Strider]] and where [[the One Ring]] got onto his finger when he fell off of a table.<ref name=\"Pony\" />\n\nIn the parlour of their rooms the hobbits met Strider, who eventually (aided by Gandalf's letter that was now brought in by Barliman) convinced Frodo that he was a friend who could guide them. When they learned that Merry had seen a [[Nazgûl|Black Rider]] within Bree they abandoned their lodgings and spent the night in Strider's room.<ref name=\"Strider\" />\n\nIn the early hours of [[30 September]] the Hobbits' room was attacked, although no one heard the intruders. It was also discovered that the hobbits' ponies and the horses of all of the other guests had been driven off. While new mounts were being found the travellers managed to get a breakfast at the inn. Many hours later, Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin left the Prancing Pony, guided by Strider.<ref>{{FR|I11}}</ref>\n\nThat same night, Gandalf, who was trying to catch up with Frodo, came to the inn. He was furious with Barliman's forgetfulness, who was very worried when he saw the hobbits leaving with the suspicious Ranger; but that made Gandalf forgive him as the Hobbits were alive and in good hands, and put a blessing on his beer. He left the [[1 October|next morning]] for [[Weathertop]].\n\nOn [[28 October]] {{TA|3019|n}}, Gandalf and the hobbits returned to Bree and stayed at the Prancing Pony.<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref> There they learned of the troubles Bree had had since their departure over a year before. In return they told Barliman of their adventures and the news that the King had returned, who was none other than Strider. Best of all for Sam was the news the [[Bill the Pony]] had returned safely there.<ref>{{RK|VI7}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn 1960 [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] began a complete rewrite of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' in which he sought to refashion the story in the same \"epic\" mode as ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. As part of this refashioning, Tolkien added elements that would tie the landscape of [[Eriador]] seen by Bilbo to that seen by Frodo. The stopping-place in Bree was specifically mentioned: \"There [Bree] they spent their last comfortable night for many a day to come, in the great inn of Bree, the Prancing Pony, well-known to the hobbits of the east side of the Shire. \"<ref>{{HH|NC2}}, p. 792</ref> In this version of the story Tolkien also sought to maintain an exact timeline, and the arrival at Bree occurred on [[2 May]] {{TA|2941|n}}.<ref>{{HH|NC3}}, note 4, p. 804</ref> Eventually though Tolkien abandoned this effort to rewrite Bilbo's tale.\n==Inspiration==\nAccording to research conducted by a branch of [[the Tolkien Society]], the Bell Inn in [[Wikipedia:Moreton-in-Marsh|Moreton-in-Marsh]] was a source of inspiration when [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] created the Prancing Pony, since the former also has three storeys and an \"entrance via a courtyard, and Moreton's similarities to the town of Bree\".<ref>\"[http://www.thepublican.com/story.asp?sectioncode=7&storycode=53323&c=1 LandLord of the Rings]\" (dated 2 November 2006) at [http://www.morningadvertiser.co.uk/ The Publican's Morning Advertiser] (accessed 16 October 2011)</ref>\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===The Prancing Pony in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nThe Lord of the Rings Online - The Prancing Pony.jpg|The Prancing Pony in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings War in the North - The Prancing Pony.jpg|The Prancing Pony in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]''\n</gallery>\n'''[[1978]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)]]'':'''\n:In a departure from the books, the Prancing Pony is invaded by the Ringwraiths on the night of Frodo's stay there.\n\n'''[[2001]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''\n:In the movie, the inn appears to be frequented only by suspicious-looking men; no hobbits are seen, and the atmosphere is more ominous than it is in the book.
