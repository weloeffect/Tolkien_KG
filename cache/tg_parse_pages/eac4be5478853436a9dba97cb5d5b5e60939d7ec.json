Seeing a gem was missing from [[Fëanor]]'s hammer, Celembrimbor knelt down to look for the missing jewel and saw a mouse on the floor beneath his workbench, whom he greeted.\n\n[[File:The Rings of Power (TV series) - Celebrimbor sees Mr Mouse.png|left|thumb|Celebrimbor when he successfully demonstrates to Annatar that Mr. Mouse is, in fact, an illusory mouse.]]\n\nCelebrimbor later grew wise in this illusion and noticed that Mr. Mouse would arrive at an appointed time of day and follow the same path each time. Recognizing that he was stuck in a [[Ósanwe-kenta|mind prison]], Celebrimbor confronted Annatar and caused him to reveal that he was indeed Sauron.\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Animals from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) characters]]"}}}
