He asked Tom to bring back tidings of the place Tom was going. Tom did not want to answer back. This angered Fisher Blue very much that he threatened to tip over Tom's boat. Not very pleased at hearing this Tom said he would cut Fisher's beak off and use it as a weather vane. After that Fisher Blue left.\n\nLater the [[Otter-folk]] found Tom's boat, docked it along side the shore and loosed it with the help of Fisher Blue, [[Willow-wren]], and [[Old Swan]]. They waited for Tom to come and look for it, but he was already heading for home by the time they loosed his boat, and so they waited for a long time.<ref name=Bombadil/>\n\n{{References}}\n{{Legend}}\n\n[[Category:Characters in The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]\n[[Category:Birds]]\n[[Category:Forest-folk]]"}}}
