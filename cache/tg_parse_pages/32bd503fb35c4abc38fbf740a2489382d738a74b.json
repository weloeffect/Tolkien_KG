In the 1980s and 1990s, Danforth was commissioned by [[Iron Crown Enterprises]] to create illustrations for ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'' and to make card art for the ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]''.\n\nWhile generally working in oils and mixed media, time constraints often led her to use ink and acrylics when doing card art.<ref name=CCGA>{{CCGA|entry=Danforth, Liz}}, pp. 110-111</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[:Category:Images by Liz Danforth|Images by Liz Danforth]]\n\n==External links==\n* '''[http://www.lizdanforth.com/ Official website]'''\n*{{WP|Liz Danforth}}{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Artists|Danforth, Liz]]\n[[Category:American people|Danforth, Liz]]\n[[Category:People by name|Danforth, Liz]]"}}}
