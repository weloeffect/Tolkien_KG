Grishnákh finally catches up to Merry and attempts to \"make a maggot hole in [his] belly\". Pippin climbs to a tree, that is revealed to have eyes. [[Treebeard]] dispatches Grishnákh and grabs both hobbits, mistaking them for orcs, whom Treebeard claims to be destructive. The hobbits succeed in convincing Treebeard of their nature, and then Treebeard leaves the hobbits on the floor, next to a white wizard.\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers scenes|13]]"}}}
