The Rite of Sigin-tarâg was invented by [[Amazon Studios]] for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]''.\n\n== History ==\nThe rite was the Dwarven test of endurance that was said by [[Durin IV]] to be fashioned by the [[Ainur|Ainu]] who created the Dwarves, [[Aulë]] himself. Presumably, the rite was used in the days since [[Durin I|Durin the Deathless]] founded [[Khazad-dûm]].\n\nLate in the [[Second Age]], [[Elrond]] invokes the rite in order to gain leave to enter Khazad-dûm. Once he reached the chamber of the test, the crown began chanting while a horn signaled the commencement of the rite as the Prince entered the chamber ending the chanting when he shouted \"''Khazad''\" with the crowd responding with \"''dûm''\". Durin precedes to explain the terms and conditions of the test to Elrond. The two competitors will both smash huge rocks with great hammers. Should the challenger forfeit or tire, they will be exiled from all Dwarven lands. Should the challenger endure, then they will be granted a single boon.\n\nAfter many hours of smashing rocks,  Elrond's hammer breaks, but he forfeits rather than being given a new hammer to continue. He then requests that Durin personally escorts him out.\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Sigin-tarâg'' is a [[Khuzdul]] word, meaning \"[[Longbeards]]\", from ''[[sigin]]'' (\"long\") and ''[[tarâg]]'' (\"beards\").<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}, p. 321, note 21</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Concepts from adaptations]]"}}}
