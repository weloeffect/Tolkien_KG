It was wide enough that the opposite shores looked small and far, while the northern and southern ends could not be seen at all.  It was fed by the Forest River and the [[River Running]] which then flowed out of the Lake over a high waterfall at its southern end.  The two rivers filled what once must have been a deep rocky valley.<ref>{{H|Welcome}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nBefore the exile of the [[Dwarves]] from [[Moria]], the realm of [[Thranduil]] is said to have extended to the western shores of the Long Lake.<ref>{{UT|6b}}</ref>  Later, after the founding of the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] and the city of [[Dale]], the trade-town of Lake-town grew up near the inflow of the River Running.  In {{TA|2941}} the lake became the grave site of the dragon [[Smaug]].<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===The Long Lake in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Long Lake.jpg|The Long Lake in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n'''2018: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Long Lake was added with the ''Strongholds of the North'' update in 2018.
