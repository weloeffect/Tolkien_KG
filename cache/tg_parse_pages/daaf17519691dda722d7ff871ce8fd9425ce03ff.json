This scene was not featured in the theatrical release of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Faramir]] leads [[Frodo]] and [[Sam]] to a sewer through which they can exit [[Osgiliath]] into the woods. Upon asking them what path they will then take, Frodo tells him that, according to [[Gollum]], there is a path near [[Minas Morgul]] leading into the mountains bordering [[Mordor]]. Alarmed at hearing this, Faramir grabs a slinking, guilty-appearing Gollum by the throat and asks harshly if he is taking the hobbits via [[Cirith Ungol]]. Gollum confirms this and Faramir warns them against taking that path, saying that a dark terror dwells in those passes. However, Frodo says he must go to Mordor. After a moment, Faramir wishes him and Sam \"Go with the good will of all [[Men]]\". \n\nAs the two hobbits disappear into the sewer, Faramir pins Gollum against the walls and says to him \"May death find you quickly, if you bring them to harm\", before throwing him towards the sewer. Gollum limps along after the two hobbits. Sam reassures Gollum that Frodo did not mean for Faramir and his men to hurt him. Gollum agrees there are no hard feelings, and in response, Sam tells him that is very decent of him. \n\n==Differences==\nIn the book, Faramir does not lead Frodo and Sam to Osgiliath. Rather, he chooses to let Frodo and Sam continue their journey to Minas Morgul while they are at [[Henneth Annûn]].<ref>{{TT|Journey}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers scenes|64]]"}}}
