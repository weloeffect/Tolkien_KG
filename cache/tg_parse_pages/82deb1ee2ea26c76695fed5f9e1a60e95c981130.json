Tolkien was prolific, on many levels.\n\nHis published <u>books</u> are many, and there are many good [[Template:Publishedmajorbooks|catalogues]] of them. \n\nHis <u>poetry</u> is numerous, a large number of them have since been published in various places. A significant selection of them appears in ''[[The Collected Poems of J.R.R. Tolkien]]''.\n\nHis <u>letters</u> are vast, but due to their largely personal nature, and the fact that they were only a ''means of communication'' in an age when messages ''must'' take a physical form, they do not always contain deep thought. Hence, a ''complete'' catalogue of them is unneeded. Still, a [[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien|good collection]] is already in existence, and its expansion can be expected.\n\nHis <u>artworks</u> are fascinating and <u>manuscripts</u> often bewildering. Several catalogues already offer us some good view of them, such as ''[[Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth|Maker of Middle-earth]]'' and ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: The Art of the Manuscript|The Art of the Manuscript]]''.\n\nThe material of his <u>linguistic inventions</u> is abundant, and much remains unpublished. But our excellent, faithful periodicals ''[[Vinyar Tengwar]]'' and ''[[Parma Eldalamberon]]'' are continuing the effort to bring more of them to light.\n\nWhat is left, then? Two.\n\nThe first is Tolkien's <u>essays</u>, <u>reviews</u>, and other short publications only in the length of an <u>article</u>. These have appeared in various periodicals or as booklets, some reprinted later others not.\n\nThe second is Tolkien's \"minor texts\" appearing in books not by him, namely the <u>forewords</u>, <u>prefatory notes</u>, etc.\n\nAssuredly, there exist many, many other media that contain even littler contributions by Tolkien, such as mere <u>notes</u> or individual <u>quotes</u>. But this page does not pursue to such an extent, as it deems them too minor or inconsequential to the main purpose, hence profitless.\n\n==Essays and articles==\n* 1923 —\n** \"Henry Bradley, 3 Dec. 1845-23 May 1923\", in ''Bulletin of the Modern Humanities Research Association''<br>- (obituary, reprinted in ''[[Tolkien Studies: Volume 12|Tolkien Studies vol. 12]]'')\n** \"Holy Maidenhood\", in ''The Times Literary Supplement''<br>- (review of ''Hali Meidenhad'' edited by F.J.

Tolkien in his physical life, several layers are needed to be explained.\n\nThe first is pre-Tolkien sphere. This is practically the entire world at the point when Tolkien was about to take his physical body. It contains all the contents, informations, and influences that would later be assimilated by him and be shaped into his thoughts. It also includes the reincarnating ego of Tolkien himself and all his past experiences.\n\nThe next is all the thoughts of Tolkien during his physical life. This was entirely founded upon the previous layer, plus all the experiences he had accumulated in this incarnation. At this layer they were not in any physical form, but can be perfectly accessed in the Akashic records.\n\nThe next is all of his written materials. This includes anything he had ever written down or drawn on any surface with any writing tool. Understandably, the vast majority of them were long lost or destroyed. But still, they remain available in the records.\n\nThe next is the material that has been preserved to this day. These ended up in various archives, libraries, and personal collections across the world. These exist in their original manuscript form.\n\nThe next is the first published form of some of those material. These have gone through the special care needed for publication, some by Tolkien himself others by others. Many of these are now near-century-old, and hard to find.\n\nThe next is the modern publication of some of those material. These are either previously unpublished, or reprinted from older publications. These are the \"Tolkien books\" that modern readers are most familiar with.\n\nThe final layer is Tolkien's legacy. These are the unneglectable influences of Tolkien's writings on the world. They inspire people to write books, to initiate all kinds of projects. They introduce new thoughts and stir up new philosophies. These influences once again merge back into the world.\n\n[[Category:Index]]"}}}
