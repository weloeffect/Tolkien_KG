The chief healer was the [[Warden of the Houses of Healing]].\n\n==History==\nWhen [[Faramir]] had been saved from the pyre of [[Denethor]], [[Gandalf]] and [[Beregond]] carried him in a bier to the Houses of Healing, with [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] following. Soon Gandalf and Pippin departed but [[Beregond]], after reporting to the chief of the Guard, went to the houses to serve and guard his captain.<ref>{{RK|V7}}</ref>\n\nLater, Faramir was joined by [[Éowyn]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], and others suffering from the [[Black Shadow]]. [[Ioreth]], one of the few women permitted to stay in the city during the siege due to her healing skills, wished aloud for a king since \"The hand of the king are the hands of a healer\". Gandalf heard her and brought [[Aragorn]] into the Houses to tend the wounded. Using ''[[athelas]]'' Aragorn was able to revive Faramir, who called him his king, Éowyn, and Merry. When Aragorn left the houses he found many waiting for him at the door and after eating he spent most of the night tending the wounded.<ref>{{RK|V8}}</ref>\n\nWhile the [[Army of the West]] marched to the [[Black Gate]], the Lady Éowyn arose in the Houses of Healing and begged the Warden to be discharged. The Warden brought her to Faramir, now able to walk in the gardens of the houses, where he dissuaded her from leaving. As the days passed their love bloomed and after the fall of [[Sauron]] it was in the Houses of Healing that they plighted their troth.<ref>{{RK|VI5}}</ref>\n\n==Other names==\n[[Tolkien]] considered to give a [[Noldorin]] name to the Houses of Healing. After some variations, he created the name '''''Bair Nestad''''', but it was never used in narrative.<ref>{{WR|3|X}}, pp. 379-380</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:BfME_II_Houses_of_Healing.png|thumb|left|The Houses of Healing addition.]]\n'''[[2003]]: {{rotkee}}:\n:Two scenes in the Houses of Healing were included in the extended edition: \"[[The Houses of Healing (scene)|The Houses of Healing]]\" and \"[[The Captain and the White Lady]]\". The former depicts [[Aragorn]] healing [[Éowyn]], and features [[The Houses of Healing (soundtrack)|a song]] sung by [[Liv Tyler]].<ref>{{rotkee}}, \"The Music of Middle-earth\"</ref> [[Éomer]] was originally not included in the scene, but [[Karl Urban]] thought it would be fitting if he were there.<ref>[[J.W. Braun]], ''[[The Lord of the Films]]'', p. 162</ref>\n\n'''[[2006]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''\n:The Houses of Healing is an addition to the fortress of the Men faction. At 1000, it is the second cheapest. It reduces hero revival time and cost by 20%. In the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king|expansion pack]], it also heals nearby allies.\n\n'''2015: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Houses of Healing consist of three separate buildings: the \"House of Rest\", the \"House of Remedies\", and the \"High Hall\".\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Buildings]]\n[[Category:Minas Tirith]]\n\n[[de:Häuser der Heilung]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/villes tours et forteresses/gondor/minas tirith/maisons de guerison]]\n[[fi:Parannuksen tarha]]"}}}
