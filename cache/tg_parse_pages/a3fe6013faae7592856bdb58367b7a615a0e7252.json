Merry is angered by this, saying ''\"But you're part of this world! Aren’t you?!\"'' The Ents look at each other somewhat uncomfortably. Treebeard gently praises Merry's bravery but tells him it is time for him to go home. \n\nMerry and Pippin prepare to return to [[the Shire]]. Pippin is somewhat accepting of this, saying that maybe they should go home since, after all, they have the Shire. \n{{blockquote|The fires of [[Isengard]] will spread And the woods of [[Tuckborough]] and [[Buckland]] will burn. And... and all that was once green and good in this world will be gone. There won't be a Shire, Pippin.|[[Merry]]}}\nPippin stands and takes Merry's words in. \n\n==Differences==\n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers scenes|52]]"}}}
