Over the course of the next 48 years Sauron gradually seduced the King and corrupted the majority of the [[Númenóreans]].<ref>{{App|SA}}, entries for the year 3261 and 3262, p. 1084</ref> In {{SA|3310}}<ref>{{App|SA}}, entry for the year 3310, p. 1084</ref> Ar-Pharazôn felt the coming of his death and initiated the building of the Great Armament, because he feared death and had listened to the lies of Sauron that he would become immortal if he possessed the undying lands of Aman.<ref name=Numenor>{{App|Numenor}}, entry for King Ar-Pharazôn, pp. 1036-7</ref><ref name=Akallabeth>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>\n\nWhen preparation of the Armament became apparent, [[Amandil]] became dismayed and attempted to sail into the West to beseech the Valar for mercy and deliverance from Sauron. His mission failed and he was never heard from again.<ref name=Akallabeth/>\n\nFor nine years<ref>{{App|SA}}, entries for the year 3310 and 3319, p. 1084</ref> Ar-Pharazôn amassed his strength in the havens of western Númenor while [[Elendil]], Amandil's son gathered a small fleet of ships in the east that held the wives and children of the [[Faithful]] as well as their heirlooms and a store of goods. In secret the ship of [[Isildur]],  Elendil's son, also held a scion of [[Nimloth of Númenor|Nimloth]], the white tree.<ref name=Akallabeth/> Elendil himself most likely carried the [[Ring of Barahir]].\n\nAs the Armament proceeded, omens appeared from the West – at first great clouds appeared in the shape of vast eagles, spreading darkness upon the land. As men hardened their hearts the clouds issued lightning that slew men, with one bolt smiting the dome of the [[Temple]] that Sauron had caused to be built in the city of [[Armenelos]]. Earthquakes shook Númenor and smoke poured from the summit of the [[Meneltarma]], yet Ar-Pharazôn pushed all the more to complete his Armament.<ref name=Akallabeth/>\n\nFinally, in {{SA|3319}},<ref>{{App|SA}}, entry for the year 3319, p. 1084</ref> the King boarded his flagship [[Alcarondas]] and led the armada into the West. It had both sails and many oars that were rowed by slaves so that it could move even when there was little wind. The Númenórean fleet was so numerous that it was compared to an archipelago of a thousand islands and it surrounded all of the island of [[Tol Eressëa]] on its way to Aman. Coming upon the silent shores of [[Valinor]], Ar-Pharazôn almost wavered but his pride won out - he landed and claimed the land for his own. [[Manwë]] then called upon [[Ilúvatar]] who put forth his power: The world was changed with a vast chasm rending the sea between Númenor and the Deathless Lands. The ships of the Great Armament were swallowed into the abyss while Ar-Pharazôn and his followers upon the shore were buried under falling hills.<ref name=Akallabeth/>\n\n{{References}}\n{{Numenor}}\n\n[[Category:Armies]]\n[[Category:Ships]]"}}}
