Anderson]], published in [[2008]]. The book is an expanded edition of J.R.R. Tolkien's acclaimed essay \"[[On Fairy-stories]]\", which expounds Tolkien's philosophy on [[Wikipedia:Fantasy|fantasy]] and thoughts on [[Wikipedia:Mythopoeia|mythopoiesis]].\n\n\"On Fairy-stories\" was originally a lecture delivered in [[1939]], Tolkien expanded and reworked it into an essay which was first published in ''[[Essays Presented to Charles Williams]]'' in [[1947]]. The essay was revised and published in ''[[Tree and Leaf]]'' in [[1964]].\n\n==Contents==\n* Introduction\n\n* Part One: The Essay\n** \"On Fairy-stories\"\n** Editors' Commentary\n** The History of \"On Fairy-stories\"\n\n* Part Two: Contemporary Reports on the 1939 Lecture\n** The 1939 Newspaper Reports\n\n* Part Three: The Manuscripts\n** Manuscript A\n** Manuscript A Commentary\n** Manuscript B\n** Manuscript B Commentary\n\n* Bibliographies\n* Index\n\nPart One reprints the essay in full, the version published in ''[[Tree and Leaf]]'' (1964), provided with commentaries by the editors. Then follows the textual history of the work, including draft excerpts from both the 1947 version and the 1964 version.\n\nNo material from the original 1939 lecture survive, but Part Two gives two contemporary newspaper reports about the lecture, which give a glimpse into what the lecture might have looked like.\n\nPart Three is a transcription of two earlier drafts of the essay, with much of the discarded writings preserved, which throws light on Tolkien's thought process on these topics.\n\n==From the publisher==\n{{blockquote|‘On Fairy-stories’ comprises about 18,000 words. What is little-known is that when Tolkien expanded the essay in 1943, he wrote many more pages of his views that were originally condensed into or cut from the published version. An estimate is difficult, but these unpublished passages perhaps amount to half again as much writing as the essay itself. These passages contain important elaborations of his views on other writers, and their publication represents a significant addition to Tolkien studies. Included in this new critical study of the work are:\n*An introductory essay setting the stage for Tolkien's 1939 lecture (the origin of the essay) and placing it within a historical context.\n*A history of the writing of ‘On Fairy-stories’, beginning with coverage of the original lecture as delivered, and continuing through to first publication in 1947.\n*The essay proper as published in corrected form in Tree and Leaf (1964).\n*Commentary on the allusions in the text, and notes about the revisions Tolkien made to the text as published in Tree and Leaf.\n*Important material not included in the essay as published, with commentary by the editors. \n\nContained within ‘On Fairy-stories’ are the roots of the tree of tales that bore such glittering fruit in Tolkien's published and unpublished work. Here, at last, Flieger and Anderson reveal through literary archaeology the extraordinary genesis of this seminal work and discuss, in their engaging commentary, how what Tolkien discovered during the writing of the essay would shape his writing for the rest of his life.}}\n\n==Publication history and gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"125px\" heights=\"125px\">\nFile:Tolkien On Fairy-stories.jpg|2008 hardcover\nFile:Tolkien On Fairy-stories.jpg|2014 paperback\nFile:Tolkien On Fairy-stories 2025.jpg|2025 paperback\n</gallery>\n* [[HarperCollins]] hardcover ([[2008]]), pp.&nbsp;320.
