When the [[dragons#Other fiction|dragon]] [[Chrysophylax]] came to the [[Middle Kingdom]] initially he was far away and therefore not a great worry to the farmer.  However, when Chrysophylax came to Quercetum and ate sheep, cows, two young people, and the village parson, the folk of Ham became alarmed and called upon Giles to save them.<ref>[[J.R.R.
