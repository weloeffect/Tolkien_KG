Many fans believe that lyrics to several Led Zeppelin songs were inspired from [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s works whilst noting that one of Robert Plant's dogs was named [[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]].\n\n==Songs with alleged Tolkien influence==\n\"'''Misty Mountain Hop'''\"\n:The lyrics describe an encounter with the police after getting stoned in the park, culminating in a resolution to leave for the [[Misty Mountains]] (\"''I'm packing my bags for the Misty Mountains / Where the spirits go now''\").\n\n\"'''Over the Hills and Far Away'''\"\n:Believed to describe ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s discovery of the [[One Ring]].\n\n\"'''The Battle of Evermore'''\"\n:Mentions the [[Ringwraiths]] and the [[Sauron|Dark Lord]]. It also mentions the \"Prince of Peace\", a messianic figure who could be [[Frodo]] or [[Aragorn]], who \"embraced the gloom\" and \"walked the night alone\". Also mentions a \"Queen of Light,\" which could allude to [[Galadriel]].\n\n\"'''Ramble On'''\"\n:Mentions [[Gollum]], the land of [[Mordor]], and \"the evil one\" (possibly Sauron).\n\n\"'''Stairway to Heaven'''\"\n:Several ambiguous lines have been interpreted as oblique references to the legendarium.\n::\"''There's a lady who's sure / All that glitters is gold''\" may be a reference to the verse \"All that is gold does not glitter\" which is repeated several times in the Lord of the Rings. \n::\"''There walks a lady we all know / Who shines white light and wants to show / How everything still turns to gold''\" may refer to Galadriel, though this is disputed.<ref>{{webcite|articlename=Exclusions|articleurl=http://www.tolkien-music.com/exclusions.html|website=TM|accessed=12 October 2012}}</ref>\n::\"''There's a feeling I get when I look to the [[Uttermost West|West]] / And my spirit is crying for leaving''\" may refer to Frodo's brief time in the Shire after the conclusion of the [[Quest of the Ring]].\n\n==External Links==\n* [https://www.ledzeppelin.com/ Official Website]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/ledzeppelin/ Facebook]\n* [http://www.reocities.com/athens/2406/ Led Zeppelin and J.R.R.
