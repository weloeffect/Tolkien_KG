The Nelyar finally entered Beleriand in {{YT|1128}} on their way to [[Balar]], but part of them didn't wish to complete the journey: some of them, the '''[[Eglath]]''', were looking for their leader [[Elwë]] who was lost in the forests, being enchanted by the [[Maia]] [[Melian]]; and others were persuaded by the Maia [[Osse]] to remain with him at the shores of Beleriand. Those became the '''[[Falathrim]]''' and built themselves the [[Havens of the Falas]] and became the first builders and sailors of ships.<ref>{{S|Princes}}</ref> \n[[File:Luis F.
