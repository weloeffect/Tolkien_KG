And, if readers have questions about Tolkien or his works, we try to answer them.\n\n\n== Published calendars ==\n*[[Beyond Bree 1985 Tolkien Calendar]]\n*[[Beyond Bree 1986 Tolkien Calendar]]\n*[[Beyond Bree 1987 Tolkien Calendar]]\n*[[Beyond Bree 1988 Tolkien Calendar]]\n*[[Beyond Bree 1989 J.R.R.
