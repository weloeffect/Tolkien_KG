Each cloak had a hood, was fitted to its wearer, and was fastened by a green [[Elven brooches|Elven-brooch]]. Their colour was hard to define – grey in twilight but green when moved or brown as fields or dusk-silver in the night. While they could not deflect a shaft or blade they acted as camouflage against unfriendly eyes.<ref name=\"Farewell\">{{FR|II8}}</ref>\n \n==History==\nOn [[16 February]] {{TA|3019}} as the Fellowship prepared to depart [[Lothlórien|Lórien]]<ref name=\"Great\">{{App|Great}}</ref> the [[Galadhrim]] brought the cloaks to the travellers. [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] asked if they were \"magic cloaks\".  The term confused the Elves but they explained their properties, which seemed magical enough – they would hide the wearers, they were light, and warm or cool as needed.<ref name=\"Farewell\"/>\n \nWhen the Fellowship were attacked at [[Sarn Gebir]] on [[23 February]]<ref name=\"Great\"/> the grey cloaks defeated the aim of the archers of [[Mordor]].<ref>{{FR|II9}}</ref> [[Boromir]]'s cloak was folded and placed beneath his head in his funeral boat<ref>{{TT|III1}}</ref> on [[26 February]].

[[Gandalf]] explained that their raiment was grey for the [[Elves]] had clad them. Gríma then proclaimed that they were in league with the Sorceress of the Golden Wood (Galadriel), which nearly caused Gimli to attack him.<ref>{{TT|III6}}</ref>\n \nOn [[29 February]],<ref name=\"Great\"/> after they had descended a cliff by [[Elven rope|rope]] in the [[Emyn Muil]], [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] thought that [[Gollum]] might not be able to see them with their Elven cloaks on, but that he could smell and hear them.<ref>{{TT|IV1}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Mouth of Sauron]] displayed Frodo's Elven cloak and brooch to the parley group at the [[Morannon]]<ref name=\"Gate\">{{RK|V10}}</ref> on [[25 March]].<ref name=\"Great\"/>  At the end of the parley Gandalf seized the tokens.<ref name=\"Gate\"/>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''[[2001]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''\n:In the movie, in Scene 41, the members of the Fellowship receive their Elven cloaks and brooches in Lórien.\n \n'''[[2002]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''\n:In the movie, in Scene 18, Sam slides down the rock-strewn slope before the [[Morannon|Gates of Mordor]]. Frodo races down while two [[Haradrim|Southron]] soldiers, seeing debris falling down the hill, approach the spot where Sam is half buried.  Frodo reaches Sam, cannot free him before the soldiers arrive, and casts his Elven cloak over the two of them.  We see the two soldiers gazing about, perplexed.  When the camera scans downward a large rock is viewed before them, which is Frodo's Elven cloak perfectly concealing him and Sam.  After they leave the cloak is thrown aside and Frodo pulls Sam free.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Objects]]"}}}
