The book is accompanied by the own pack of cards called '''''The Lord of the Rings Tarot Deck & Card Game'''''.\n\n==Synopsis of the publisher==\n{{blockquote|The Lord of the Rings Tarot unites two great traditions: the spiritual, mystical tradition of the tarot, and the world of folklore and fairy tales that is most delightfully depicted in the works of J.R.R. Tolkien. The added factor of a card game summons you to travel through Middle-earth to reach Mount Doom and destroy the One Ring!<br /><br />Fanciful characters and scenes from J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy and 'The Hobbit' appear on each of the 22 Major Arcana and 56 Minor Arcana cards. Rules are included for a card game for 2-6 players, ages 10 to adult.}}\n\n==Card Game==\nThe instructions included with the tarot cards also contains a set of rules for a competitive card game. Each tarot card bears a symbol that shows it is aligned with one of the factions: \"Free Peoples\" (FP, 51 cards), \"Dark Forces\" (DF, 20 cards), \"Neutral\" (N, six cards) or \"The One Ring\" (OR, one card). Players earn victory points by playing all of their cards, being the ring-bearer (The Wheel of Fortune) and having the most and/or least Dark Points at the end of the round, three of which are played (mimicking the three volumes of the book).\n\n==Major Arcana==\n* 0 -
