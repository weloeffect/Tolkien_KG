It is where the [[Nazgûl|Nine]] were buried and is described more as a dungeon than as a grave.\n\nDuring the meeting of the [[White Council]] in ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'', it was first mentioned by Lady [[Galadriel]] as the location where the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]] (along with his [[Morgul-knife|Morgul blade]]) was buried after Angmar [[Battle of Fornost|fell]]. She said that the Men of the North took his body and all that he possessed and sealed it within the High Fells and  powerful spells were put by the Elves, as it is implied by [[Elrond]]. A place that is said to be so dark, that it would never come to light.\n\nIn ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'', [[Gandalf]] and [[Radagast]] go to investigate the High Fells, revealing that it is also the location where the other Ringwraiths were buried. The [[Wizards]] find all the crypts are broken open from the inside. After learning that the Nine have returned to [[Sauron|their master]], Radagast persuades Gandalf, who wished to rejoin [[Thorin and Company]] at that point, to investigate the ruins of [[Dol Guldur]]. \n==See also==\n*[[Coldfells]]\n==External links==\n* [https://middle-earth.xenite.org/where-in-movie-middle-earth-were-the-9-graves-of-the-nazgul/ Where in Movie Middle-earth were the 9 Graves of the Nazgul?] by [[Michael Martinez]]\n[[Category:Locations from adaptations]]"}}}
