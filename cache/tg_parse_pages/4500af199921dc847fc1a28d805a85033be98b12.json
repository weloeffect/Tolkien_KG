However, the battle halted and all the men of both sides fled upon the arrival of [[Aragorn]] with the [[Oathbreakers|Army of the Dead]] - all save Angbor who alone had the heart to face them.  Aragorn bade Angbor to gather his folk and follow him to [[Pelargir]] where \"the Heir of [[Isildur]] will have need of you.\"\n\nAs Aragorn pressed on to Pelargir, Angbor mustered as many horsemen as he could, helped by the fast-spreading rumour of the return of the Heir of Isildur.  His force arrived at the riverside city on [[13 March]] after the Shadow Host had cleared the ships.  Afterwards, as Aragorn, [[Gimli]], [[Legolas]], the [[Grey Company]], and the freed men of [[Gondor]] rowed north upon the [[Anduin]], Angbor led his horsemen north by land.\n\nIn the debate on [[16 March]] before the march to the [[Morannon]], [[Imrahil]] expressed concern for the defence of Gondor.  Aragorn assured him that new strength was on the way, stating that Angbor, whom he named \"the fearless\", was marching with 4,000 men through [[Lossarnach]].  Angbor's strength would be nearing [[Minas Tirith]] as Aragorn departed, thus leaving the city with a better defence than when the assault began.<ref>{{RK|V9}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Angbor'' is [[Sindarin]] for \"Iron Fist\",<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 588</ref> from ''[[ang]]'' (\"iron\") + ''[[paur]]'' (\"fist, hand\").\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Angbor in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Angbor.jpg|Angbor in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Angbor is the Lord of [[Lamedon]], ruling from the town of [[Calembel]]. During the [[War of the Ring]] he is charged by Prince [[Imrahil]] with protecting the land from the Corsairs of [[Umbar]] while other Lords of Gondor ride to the defence of [[Minas Tirith]]. Leaving his son Drambor in charge of Calembel, Angbor decides to make the stand against the Corsairs in [[Linhir]] where both sides except Angbor would flee before the [[Oathbreakers]] of [[Dunharrow]]. Angbor immediately recognises [[Aragorn]] as his King and after swearing loyalty to him, joins his host with the [[Grey Company]], leading his men in the liberation of [[Pelargir]]. Before departing on the Corsair ships, Aragorn orders Angbor to march his men towards towards the White City and the player accompanies his men for a while on their way through Upper [[Lebennin]] and [[Lossarnach]] before parting ways. Angbor and his men arrive to Minas Tirith shortly after the [[Battle of Pelennor Fields]] is over, and while many of his men stay behind to protect the city, Angbor himself joins the Host of the West. He fights in and eventually survives the [[Battle of the Morannon]].\n \n{{references}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:Dúnedain]]\n[[Category:Gondorians]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n\n[[de:Angbor]]\n[[fi:Angbor]]"}}}
