In this stage, the name ''Kôr'' referred to the city as well as the hill it was situated on.\n\n==History==\nWhen the [[Noldoli]] and the [[Vanyar|Teleri]] arrived in Valinor, they set to the making of their home. They found a low place in the mountains that sheltered Valinor. There, at the end of a long creek that stretched inland, was a single hill with no trees but a deep covering of grass, and harebells at its top. The Elves chose this as their dwelling place. The [[Valar]] named it Kôr for its roundness and smoothness, and [[Aulë]] scattered golden dust about the feet of the hill. The Elves built a city of white on top of the hill using stone and marble, and they lined the streets with dark trees. [[Inwë]]'s house was at the very top, and it had a tall silver [[Mindon Eldaliéva|tower]] with a white lamp set in it. The Valar gave both Inwë and [[Nólemë]] shoots of each of the [[Two Trees of Valinor]], and they grew and blossomed.<ref name=Coming>{{LT1|V}}</ref>{{rp|122–3}}\n\n[[Inwë]] was the king of all Eldar during the time the Elves dwelt in Kôr.<ref name=Cottage/>{{rp|16}} [[Rúmil (elf of Tirion)|Rúmil]] had dwelt there, and it was there that he learned from [[Aulë]] much of the [[Valarin|language]] of the [[Valar]].<ref>{{LT1|II}}</ref>{{rp|48}} \n\nUpon the arrival of the [[Solosimpi]] to Valinor, there was much joy in Kôr, and its inhabitants fared out to welcome their long sundered kin. However, the Solosimpi chose to live on the shores rather than in Kôr with the Teleri and Noldoli.<ref name=Coming/>{{rp|126}} The wisdom of lore of the Gnomes increased in Kôr, and they, with the help of Aulë created ways to write language. Then many tales and runes were written on the walls of Kôr or carved into the stones. But [[Melko]] sowed seeds of dissent among the Gnomes, and in his anger brought a complaint against them to [[Manwë]]. Then an embassy of the Gnomes came and spoke against Melko and his lies. Manwë scolded both, sending Melko away to [[Halls of Mandos|Mandos]], and telling Aulë to find a [[Sirnúmen|new place]] for the Gnomes to dwell, lest their discontent spread among the others at Kôr. Great then was the sorrow of the Gnomes at leaving their home.<ref name=Theft>{{LT1|VI}}</ref>{{rp|141–3}}\n\nAs the [[Samírien|feast of Double Mirth]] approached, all of the Elves travelled to the gates of [[Valmar]], and great hosts came from Kôr along the road that had been laid for such a purpose. With the cities of the Elves emptied, Melko chose this time to travel to the dwelling place of the Gnomes and steal the [[Silmarils]], slaying the guards there. At this time a great sadness and unrest came over Valinor. At the petitioning of Aulë, Manwë granted permission to the Gnomes to return to Kôr if they wished, and seek to rebuild their happiness. Many went back to Kôr, but [[Fëanor]] was angered. He spoke against the Valar, saying that it would be better for the Elves to leave Valinor.<ref name=Theft/>{{rp|143–50}}\n\nAfter the [[Darkening of Valinor|destruction of the Two Trees]], Fëanor stood in the [[Great Square|square]] at the top of Kôr and called for the Elves to come and listen to him. Most of those who came were of the Noldoli. Again Fëanor spoke angrily regarding the Valar, and persuaded his people to arm themselves and [[Flight of the Noldor|leave Valinor]]. Many of their youngest children remained behind, however, as did the Teleri.<ref>{{LT1|VII}}, pp. 162-3</ref> There was sorrow in Valinor for a long while. However, following the creation of the [[Sun|Ships]] [[Moon|of Light]] and the [[Hiding of Valinor]], those left in Kôr at last forgot their sorrows. Kôr became the fairest realm of Valinor, and although the trees of Nólemë were uprooted and lost, the trees given to Inwë still shone in his courtyard.<ref>{{LT1|IX}}, p. 213</ref>\n\nKôr was located near to the [[Cottage of the Children]], which was reachable by some  children of Men in their sleep via the [[Olórë Mallë]], the Path of Dreams, until that was shut. Despite the efforts of the [[Eldar]] to guide them to the Cottage, some few of the children strayed to Kôr and, becoming captivated by its beauty, wished to remain forever.<ref name=Cottage>{{LT1|I}}</ref>{{rp|18–9}} \n\nKôr had been abandoned by the Gnomes long before [[Eriol]] came to [[Kortirion]], which was built and named in its memory.<ref name=CottageIn>{{LT1|In}}</ref>{{rp|25–6}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name of ''Kôr'' refers to its roundness: it is derived from [[Primitive Elvish]] name ''Guord'' from which came [[Qenya]] ''Qora'' and [[Gnomish]] ''Gwar''.<ref name=lt6>{{LT2|VI}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nThe city originated in Tolkien's poetry from before he had even begun to work on the legendarium in earnest. Tolkien wrote a poem titled ''Kôr'' on 30 April of [[1915]]. This title was later changed to ''[[The City of the Gods]]''.\n\nMuch of the description of Kôr was preserved in the accounts of the later [[Tirion]] upon [[Túna]].<ref>{{LT1|Vn}}, pp. 135-136</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Kortirion]]\n*[[Tirion]]\n*[[Túna]]\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kor}}\n[[Category:Hills]]\n[[Category:Qenya locations]]"}}}
