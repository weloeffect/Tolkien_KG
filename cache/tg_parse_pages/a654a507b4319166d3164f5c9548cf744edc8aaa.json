[[Manthor]], acted as Húrin's \"friend\" during the moot.<ref name=\"Moot\"/>\n\nNear the end, Húrin accused the [[Haladin]] of mistreating [[Túrin]] and [[Niënor]]; while accusing Hardang of causing [[Morwen|Morwen's]] death. Before Hardang was able to present his side of the matter, a revolt broke out in the Moot-ring, before moving to the wider [[Obel Halad|town]]. In the ensuing battle, the [[Hall of the Chieftains]] was burned down, Hardang was killed, Manthor was shot, and Avranc gained power over the remnant of the Haladin.<ref name=\"Moot\"/>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Events]]\n[[Category:First Age]]"}}}
