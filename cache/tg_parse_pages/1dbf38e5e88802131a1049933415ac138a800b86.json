He sent letters to the Tolkien children from [[1920]] to [[1943]] and they are collected in a book called ''[[Letters from Father Christmas]]''.\n==Characteristics==\nFather Christmas was magical and his magic was especially powerful on Christmas.<ref>{{LFC|1929b}}</ref>\nFather Christmas had very shaky handwriting being over 1900 years old by the time he started writing the letters.<ref name=l23>{{LFC|1923}}</ref> He was prone to stress which made his handwriting even worse.<ref name=l25>{{LFC|1925}}</ref>\n==History==\nFather Christmas wrote his first letter to [[John Tolkien]] in [[1920]] after the then three-year-old,<ref>{{LFC|Intro}}</ref> John had asked what Father Christmas was like and where he lived.<ref name=l20>{{LFC|1920}}</ref>\n\nChristmas in [[1924]] was very busy so he didn't have time to write a full letter but he wrote a short letter to both John and [[Hilary Tolkien|Hilary]] wishing them well and explaining he didn't have time to write a letter because he had to go deliver presents.<ref>{{LFC|1924a}}</ref><ref>{{LFC|1924b}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1925]], Father Christmas had to move from the [[Christmas House]] to the [[Cliff House]]. The North Polar Bear had tried to rescue his hood that had been blown onto the roof and fell through the roof and made a hole in the living room.<ref name=l25/>\n\n[[1926]] was a very stressful year. The [[North Polar Bear]] set off a firework which turned the North Pole black, shook the stars and cracked the moon into four and the [[Man in the Moon]] had fallen. He ate a lot of Father Christmas' chocolates before returning to the moon. Then the reindeer got loose and ran wild around the North Pole. The North Polar Bear then turned on two years worth of Northern Lights.<ref>{{LFC|1926}}</ref> Because of this there were no Northern Lights until [[1928]]<ref name=l27>{{LFC|l27}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1932]], Father Christmas and the North Polar Bear discovered a tunnel in their cellar leading from the caves that had been dug by [[Orcs#Other writings|Goblins]]. The Goblins stole all of the items from the main cellar and although they were able to get the items back, [[Mr Cave Bear]], his sons and the Gnome-ladies had to help prepare for Christmas in order to be done in time.<ref name=\"1932b\"/>\n==Other names==\nFather Christmas also signed his letters as '''Father Nicholas Christmas''',<ref>{{LFC|1930a}}</ref><ref>{{LFC|1930b}}</ref><ref>{{LFC|1931a}}</ref><ref>{{LFC|1932a}}</ref><ref>{{LFC|1933}}</ref> or just '''Nicholas Christmas'''.<ref name=1932b/> In one letter, the [[North Polar Bear]] calls him '''Daddy Noel'''.<ref name=1932b>{{LFC|1932b}}</ref>\n\n==External links==\n* {{WP|Father Christmas}}\n* [http://narnia.fandom.com/wiki/Father_Christmas Father Christmas] at Narnia Wiki\n{{references}}\n{{WLFC}}\n[[Category:Characters in Letters from Father Christmas]]\n[[Category:Mythology]]\n[[de:Weihnachtsmann]]"}}}
