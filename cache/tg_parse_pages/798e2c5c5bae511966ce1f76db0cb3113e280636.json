After receiving this, she asked for wine, which should be brought to her at noon in a golden flagon while the bearer sang. Then she asked her mother for a spinning wheel, and asked [[Dairon]] for a tiny loom.\n\nHaving all she needed, when she was alone, she took the water and wine, and mixed them together. While the mixture was in the golden bowl, she sang a song of growth; and while it was in the silver one, she sang a song about all the tallest and longest things upon Earth: \"the beards of the [[Indravangs]], the tail of [[Karkaras]], the body of [[Glorund]], the bole of Hirilorn, and the sword of Nan she named, nor did she forget the chain [[Angainu]] that [[Aulë]] and [[Tulkas]] made or the neck of Gilim the giant, and last and longest of all she spake of the hair of [[Uinen]] the lady of the [[sea]] that is spread through all the waters.” Then Tinúviel washed her hair with the enchanted water and wine, and meanwhile she sang a third song about deep sleep. Her hair began growing swiftly, and in half a day, it almost covered the whole room, and when she woke up the next morning, her hair was flowing out of the windows. She worked long and hard to weave a magical robe of sleepiness and a rope to escape from her prison.<ref>{{LT2|I}}, pp. 19-20</ref>\n\n===The Lay of Leithian===\nIn ''[[The Lay of Leithian]]'', Lúthien's father [[Thingol]] placed her in a guarded treehouse. Through a spell of invoking the longest things in the world, she grew out her hair and made a robe and a rope of it: \"''a magic dress / that all was drenched in drowsiness''\". Lowering the rope, she put her guards to sleep and escaped.<ref name=\"Lengthening\">{{LB|C5}}, p. 205</ref>\n\nBelow is a list of invocations within the lengthening spell.<ref name=\"Lengthening\"/>\n\n* '''locks of the [[Longbeards|Longbeard]] [[dwarves]]''' - One of the seven clans of Dwarves.\n* '''tail of [[Draugluin]]''' - The father of the [[Werewolves]].\n* '''body of [[Glaurung|Glómund]]''' - A great snake with a long body.\n* '''vast upsoaring peaks''' - The mountains of [[Thangorodrim]] above [[Angband]].\n* '''[[Angainor]]''' - The great chain that the [[Valar|Gods]] will contain [[Morgoth]] with.
