Noel]]'s first book on the works of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. It is largely overshadowed by her second work, ''[[The Languages of Tolkien's Middle-earth]]''. The book focuses on the basics of Tolkien's mythological influences. It does not go as in-depth into the analysis as some other published works.\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Scholarly books|Mythology of Middle-earth]]\n[[Category:Publications by title|Mythology of Middle-earth]]"}}}
