It also shows the lands to the north of the [[Icebay of Forochel]] and the island of [[Tol Fuin]] west of the island of [[Himling]] off the coast of [[Forlindon]] in the [[Belegaer]] ocean. The sea west of the [[Icebay of Forochel]] was labeled as ''[[North Sea]]'' in pencil.\n==Early concepts==\nA label \"Forodwaith (Northerland)\" is written in the area between the river [[Baranduin]] and the river [[Gwathló]] and extends from south of the [[Sarn Ford]] to beyond the northern end of the [[Misty Mountains]]. There is no label \"Eriador\" on the map. However, J.R.R. Tolkien added \"(or Eriador)\" after \"Forodwaith\" on The 1943 Map of The Lord of the Rings.<ref>{{TI|MII}}, p. 306</ref> This and the absence of the name Eriador from earlier manuscripts suggest that Forodwaith was initially used as a name of the region that was later called Eriador.\n\nA label \"[[Westfold]]\" was written to the south of a label \"[[Dunland]]\" west of the southern end of the Misty Mountains and north of the river [[Isen]], but was struck through<ref>{{TI|MIVd}}, p. 320</ref> and reinserted west of [[Edoras]], north of the northern foothills of the [[White Mountains|\"Black Mountains\"]].<ref>{{WR|1|II}}, Notes, Note 4, pp. 22-23</ref> This and the use of the name Westfold for the land of the Westfolders, the invaders of Rohan in earlier drafts of ''[[The Two Towers]]''<ref>{{WR|1|II}}, pp. 21-22</ref><ref>{{WR|1|III}}, Notes, Note 8, p. 41</ref> suggest that Westfold was initially used as a name of the region that was later called Dunland.\n==External links==\n*[https://thetolkienist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/first-map-of-Lord-of-the-Rings_web.jpg Facsimile of the First Map of the Lord of the Rings] (included in a [https://thetolkienist.com/2018/10/25/one-exhibition-catalogue-to-rule-them-all-tolkien-maker-of-middle-earth-by-catherine-mcilwaine/ blog entry] by The Tolkienist)\n{{references}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:The First Map of ''The Lord of the Rings''}}\n{{Maps}}\n[[Category:Maps of Middle-earth]]"}}}
