It was extended in the latter edition.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe scene begins with [[Gollum|Sméagol]] inspecting a worm while fishing with [[Déagol]] on a riverboat in the middle of a peaceful, forested area. Déagol hooks onto a large fish which drags him underwater. There he sees a glint of gold half buried in the riverbed and, entranced by it, he grabs it. \n\nOn coming to the surface and returning to the bank, he discovers in his hand a plain golden [[The One Ring|ring]], covered in mud. A cheerful Sméagol comes to Déagol, but upon seeing the ring, immediately lusts for it, saying ''\"It's my birthday, and I wants it\"''. Déagol refuses and the two begin to fight. Sméagol takes it by force, murdering Déagol to do so. Taking it out of Déagol's lifeless hand, a look of pure joy crosses Sméagol's face. ''\"My precious!\"'' he says, before putting the ring on for the first time and vanishing. \n\nThe scene cuts to a Sméagol who has become entirely dependent upon the ring, uttering ''\"Gollum!\"'' while holding the ring. He gradually forgets his name and we witness his transformation and decline into his present-day condition. \n\n==Differences==\nThis scene follows the account of [[Gollum|Sméagol]] and [[Déagol]] as told by [[Gandalf]] to [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] in the book chapter [[The Shadow of the Past]] very closely in terms of both narrative, and dialogue (after Déagol emerges from underwater). The two [[Stoors|Stoor-hobbits]] indeed go fishing, Déagol is dragged under water and finds the [[The One Ring|ring]], and Sméagol strangles him to take it.<ref name=\"FRShadow\">{{FR|Shadow}}, pp. 52-4</ref> Where this scene ''differs'' from the source material is in what is ''not'' included, which mainly covers Sméagol's malicious use of the ring upon returning to his family, before being expelled by his grandmother. This results in him eventually ending up under the [[Misty Mountains]].<ref name=\"FRShadow\"/> \n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King scenes|01]]"}}}
