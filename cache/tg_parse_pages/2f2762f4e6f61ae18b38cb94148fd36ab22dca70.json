Tolkien''''' is a collection of the proceedings of the 30th Tolkien Society Seminar held in Leeds in 2017. The book was published by [[The Tolkien Society]] in [[2018]] under the auspices of the [[Peter Roe Memorial Fund]].\n\n==Contents==\n\n* \"Introduction\" by Anna Milon\n* \"In search of the Wandering Fire: otherwordly imagery in ‘The Song of Ælfwine’\" by Massimiliano Izzo\n* \"‘Diadem the Fallen Day’: Astronomical and Arboreal Motifs in the Poem ‘Kortirion Among the Trees’\" by [[Kristine Larsen]]\n* \"The Magical and Reality-Transforming Function of Tolkien’s Song and Verse\" by Szymon Pyndur\n* \"Translating The Lay of Aotrou and Itroun into French: across the Channel here and back again\" by Bertrand Bellet\n\n==From the publisher==\n{{blockquote|J.R.R. Tolkien regarded himself ‘chiefly as a poet’ (Carpenter, ''The Inklings'', p. 29) and the importance of poetic diction and its most potent form, song, provides a powerful leitmotif to his mythological universe. Following the publication of Tolkien’s two verse works: ''The Lay of Atrou and Itroun'' (2016) and ''Beren and Lúthien'' (2017), The Tolkien Society called for papers re-examining the importance of poetry and song in Tolkien’s writing. A series of presentations both on the author’s poems and on verse incorporated into his worldbuilding were given in Leeds on the 2nd of July 2017. Published under the auspices of the Society’s Peter Roe Memorial Fund, this book features a collection of four papers delivered on the day by aspiring and established Tolkien scholars alike.}}\n\n{{peterroe}}\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Publications by the Tolkien Society]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]"}}}
