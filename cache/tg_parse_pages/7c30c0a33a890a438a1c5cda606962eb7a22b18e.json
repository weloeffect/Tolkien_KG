I find his prose\n:obscure at times. Not easily it flows;\n:too often are his lights held up in brackets.\n:Yet error, should he spot it, he'll attack its\n:sources and head, exposing ramps and rackets,\n:the torturous byways of the wicked heart\n:and intellect corrupt. Yea, many a dart\n:he crosses with the fiery ones! The art\n:of minor fiends and major he reveals —\n:when Charles is on his trail the devil squeals,\n:for cloven feet have vulnerable heels.<ref name=inklings>''[[The Inklings (book)|The Inklings: C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, Charles Williams and Their Friends]]'', ch. 2: \"'We had nothing to say to one another'\", pp. 123-6</ref></poem>\n\n=== Third stanza ===\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\n:Geography indeed! Here he again\n:exerts a subtle mind and labouring pen.\n:Geodesy say rather; for many a 'fen'\n:he wrote, and chapters bogged in tangled rhymes,\n:and has survived Europa's lands and climes,\n:dividing her from P'o-L'u's crawling slimes,\n:to her diving buttocks, breast, and head\n:(to say no fouler thing), where I instead,\n:dull-eyed, can only see a watershed,\n:a plain, an island, or a mountain-chain.\n:In that gynecomorphical terrain\n:History and Myth are ravelled in a skein\n:of endless interchange. I do not hope\n:to understand the deeds of king or pope,\n:wizard or emperor; beyond my scope\n:is that dark flux of symbol and event,\n:where fable, faith, and faërie are blent\n:with half-guessed meanings to some great intent\n:I cannot grasp. For Mount Elburz to me\n:is but a high peak far beyond the sea\n:(and high and far I'd ever have it be).<ref name=inklings/></poem>\n\n=== Last stanza ===\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\n:'When your fag is wagging and spectacles are twinkling,\n:when tea is brewing or the glasses tinkling,\n:then of your meaning often I've an inkling,\n:your virtues and your wisdom glimpse. Your laugh\n:in my heart echoes, when with you I quaff\n:the pint that goes down quicker than a half,\n:because you're near. So, heed me not! I swear\n:when you with tattered papers take the chair\n:and read (for hours maybe), I would be there.\n:And ever when in state you sit again\n:and to your car imperial give rein,\n:I'll trundle, grumbling, squeaking, in the train\n:of the great rolling wheels of Charles' Wain.<ref name=inklings/></poem>\n\n{{references}}\n{{poems}}\n\n[[Category:Poems by J.R.R.
