After this, He propounded to them themes of music, which later would initiate the [[Music of the Ainur]] and the Creation of the World.\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn the first version of the story, it is specified that Ilúvatar \"sang into being the Ainur\" and thereafter he made their dwellings in the [[void]].<ref>{{LT1|Music}}, p. 52</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nThe creation of a spiritual hierarchy resembles the creation of angels by the Judeo-Chistian God. However, it also implies ideas previous to [[Christianity]], as [[Verlyn Flieger]] explains:\n\n{{blockquote|The concept of offspring from One suggests a sort of Pythagorean divisibility of a unity into component parts without disminution of the whole. The Ainur are powers or principalities emanating directly from the godhead and are developed in the text as aspects of his nature.<ref>[[Verlyn Flieger]], ''[[Splintered Light]]'' (Revised Edition), \"Splintered Light and Splintered Being\", p. 51</ref>}}\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Events]]"}}}
