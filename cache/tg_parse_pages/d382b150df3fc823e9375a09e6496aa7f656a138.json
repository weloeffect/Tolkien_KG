He was known as \"Caranthir the Dark\".\n\n==History==\n[[File:Marya Filatova - The one who stays - 2.jpg|thumb|left|The Wife of Caranthir. Art by [[Marya Filatova]]|125px]]\nAs with the other [[Sons of Fëanor]], Caranthir was bound by the [[Oath of Fëanor]] to recover his [[Fëanor|father]]'s [[Silmarils]], which had been stolen by the Dark Lord [[Morgoth]]. This oath brought the [[Noldor]] to [[Middle-earth]] near the end of the [[First Age]].<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref> [[Angrod]] of the [[House of Finarfin]] was the first messenger of the Noldor to come to King [[Thingol]] who gave his permission to the Noldor to dwell in some free lands, but not in [[Doriath]], as he considered himself Lord of Beleriand. Angrod informed the Noldor of this during their [[council in Mithrim]], and Maedhros laughed at Thingol's claims, remarking that Thingol had merely given them lands in which he had no power. But Caranthir despised the children of [[Finarfin]], and spoke in anger against Angrod, saying that he ought not to have been the spokesperson of the Noldor. Maedhros rebuked him, but division between Noldor increased after the outburst.<ref name=\"Return\">{{S|Return}}</ref>\n\nThe people of Caranthir went to the furthermost [[East Beleriand]], reaching [[Ered Luin]], and there they became the first of Noldor to encounter the [[Dwarves]]. Caranthir disliked the Dwarves for their unloveliness, but though there was little love between the two peoples, they allied against their common enemy: Morgoth. The alliance brought great profit, for all the trading that came to Beleriand from the Dwarves went first through Caranthir's hands, and he gained great wealth.<ref name=\"Return\">{{S|Return}}</ref> Caranthir's realm was in [[Thargelion]], and was sometimes called ''[[Dor Caranthir]]'' (\"Land of Caranthir\"). His abode was on the shores of [[Helevorn|Lake Helevorn]].<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>\n\nIn {{FA|375}}, Caranthir rescued [[Haleth]] and her people, the [[Haladin]], when they were [[Battle of the Gelion-Ascar Stockade|besieged]] by [[Orcs]]. At last recognizing the valour of [[Men]], he offered the Haladin a fiefdom in his lands to the North. However, Haleth's heart was proud, and wanting her people to serve no lord she thanked him but removed to the [[Forest of Brethil]].<ref>{{S|West}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Dagor Bragollach]], Caranthir was forced to retreat and joined the remnant of his people to the scattered folk of [[Amrod]] and [[Amras]]. They fled to the south and maintained a watch upon [[Amon Ereb]], aided by the [[Laegil]].<ref name=\"Fingolfin\">{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>\n\nIn {{FA|463}}, the [[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterling]] [[Ulfang]] led his people over the [[Blue Mountains]], and they allied themselves with [[Maedhros]].
