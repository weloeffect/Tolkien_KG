Elrond recognizes the sword at first glance, and afterwards identifies Glamdring. The Goblins found Orcrist on Thorin after they captured the Dwarves and Bilbo and it was recognized by the guard who removes it from his person. Thorin's recovery of it is not depicted.\n\n'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:''' \n:As in the book, the sword is found in the trolls' cave and is identified as Orcrist by [[Elrond]] in [[Rivendell]]. It's designed as a straight, single-edged sword with a prominent recurve at the cutting edge. Its pommel consists of two prongs, and it possesses a half-guard (whereas most Elven swords in Jackson's films are shown without guards). The grip of the sword is fashioned from a dragon's tooth and the base of the blade contains the [[Sindarin]] inscription \"NAGOL E-LYG\" meaning \"Tooth of-Snake [or dragon]\".<ref>[[Jude Fisher]], ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug: Visual Companion]]'', p. 13</ref>\n\n:When it is discovered by the Goblins, the [[Great Goblin]] recognizes the sword, and claims that it sliced a thousand necks. Later, when Thorin and Company are captured by the Wood-elves, [[Legolas]] personally confiscates the sword, believing that Thorin Oakenshield had stolen it from his kinfolk. He then takes up the legendary weapon as his own, using it when [[Bolg]] and his stealth-Orcs raid Lake-town in search of the Dwarves, and during the Battle of the Five Armies, where he returns Orcrist to Thorin just in time for his final showdown with [[Azog| Azog the Defiler]].\n\n{{references}}\n{{Weapons}}\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n[[Category:Swords]]\n[[de:Orcrist]]\n[[fi:Orkrist]]\n[[fr:encyclo/artefacts/armes/orcrist]]"}}}
