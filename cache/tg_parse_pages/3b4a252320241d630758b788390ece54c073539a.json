Made from a cave, the lair served as the three trolls hideout from the [[Sun]], their treasury and storeroom.\n\n==Description==\nThe cave floor had bones and an untidy litter of plunder, from brass button to pots of gold. On shelves was a good deal of food, along with a barrel of ale. Clothing of victims hung on the walls as well as several swords. There was also a horrible smell in the air.<ref name=\"Mutton\">{{H|Mutton}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{quote|One may guess that your [[trolls]] had plundered, other plunderers, or come on the remnants of old robberies in some hole in the mountains of old. I have heard that there are still forgotten treasures to be found in the deserted caverns of the mines of [[Moria]], since the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs|dwarf and goblin war]].|[[Elrond]]<ref name=Mutton/>}}\n\nAfter [[Gandalf]] had rescued [[Thorin]] and his party from the trolls during the [[Quest for Erebor]] in {{TA|2941}}<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2941, p. 1089</ref>, he reminded them that the trolls must have a cave or hole to hide in from the sun. Searching about, they followed the marks of stony boots uphill to a big stone door hidden by bushes. Pushing and incantations by Gandalf did not open it. Then Bilbo asked if the key he had found would help. It did.<ref name=\"Mutton\" />\n\nThe party took much of the food, the barrel of ale, and the gold. Gandalf and Thorin took two swords with beautiful scabbards and jewelled hilts, and Bilbo took a knife in a leather sheath (which for a hobbit was as good as a short sword). Outside the cave the party ate and rested, and then buried the pots of gold near the river with many spells put over them.<ref name=\"Mutton\" />\n\nLater, in [[Rivendell]], [[Elrond]] read the runes on the swords of Gandalf and Thorin. He revealed that they were very old and had been made by the High Elves of the West, in [[Gondolin]]. Thus from the Trolls' lair Thorin obtained [[Orcrist]] (meaning Goblin-cleaver in [[Sindarin]]) and Gandalf got [[Glamdring]] (meaning Foe-hammer in Sindarin).<ref>{{H|Rest}}</ref> Much later Bilbo would name his short sword from the Trolls' lair \"[[Sting]]\".<ref>{{H|Flies}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[War of the Ring]] on October 18 {{TA|3018}}<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3018, October 18, p. 1092</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 188</ref> [[Frodo Baggins]], [[Samwise Gamgee]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] [[Peregrin Took]] and [[Aragorn]] passed by the Trolls' lair by accident and saw the three trolls that had been turned to stone outside.<ref>{{FR|Flight}}, pp. 204-5</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn the manuscript for ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the Company found something else in the Trolls' lair besides the three swords - they also found the key to the [[Back Door]] of the [[Lonely Mountain]], although they did not know it at the time.<ref>{{HH|Trolls}}, p. 97</ref> Gandalf took charge of the key in the cave and gave it to Thorin just before he departed from the Company at the gates of [[Mirkwood]].<ref>{{HH|Medwed}}, p. 244</ref> On [[Durin's Day]] it was Bilbo who recalled the troll-key and they found that it was the right one to open the door.<ref>{{HH|Lonely}}, p. 476</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''1968: ''[[The Hobbit (1968 radio series)]]'':'''\n:The Trolls' lair features in this adaptation without any difference from book.\n'''1977: ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)]]'':'''\n:In this film, the Trolls' lair does not have a locked door as in the book.\n'''1979: ''[[The Hobbit (1979 radio series)]]'':'''\n:The Trolls' lair appears in this adaptation with the same role as in the book.\n'''2003: ''[[The Hobbit (2003 video game)]]'':'''\n:In the game, the Trolls' lair is explored by Bilbo, and it is implied that it was built by [[Witch-king]].\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Trolls' lair, along with the Stone Trolls' Glade, is located in the Trollshaws region.
