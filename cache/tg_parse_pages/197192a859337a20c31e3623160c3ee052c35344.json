Therefore, unlike many other tongues, Khuzdul is unrelated in origin when compared to the languages of the [[Elves]], due to Aulë himself teaching the Dwarves. Few of other races have ever succeeded in learning it.<ref>{{S|10}}</ref><ref>{{App|Other}}</ref> The Dwarves were not unwilling to teach Khuzdul to their close friends, but Men found it difficult to learn more than a few words, some of which were loaned.<ref name=\"pmrel\" /> \n\nIn the [[First Age]], before the ancestors of the [[Edain]] crossed into [[Beleriand]], they had contact with the Dwarves in [[Rhovanion]] and later in the [[Blue Mountains]]. As such, there are many similarities between Khuzdul and the native tongues of men, such as [[Taliska|the language of the first and third houses]] of the [[Edain]]. That language was the ancestor of [[Adûnaic]], the tongue of Númenor and the direct ancestor of the [[Westron|Common Speech]]. These [[Mannish]] languages displayed Khuzdul influences.<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #4</ref>\n\nDuring the Third Age the Dwarves of the [[Westlands]] had mostly adopted [[Westron]] and Khuzdul was a learned language, being taught to their children at an early age. They used it among themselves and as a language of books and lore, and for records not intended for outsiders.<ref name=\"DM\">{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref>\n\nBy their own will the Dwarves resisted the change of their language<ref name=\"pmrel\">{{PM|Relations}}</ref> and the language diversified and changed slowly, 'like the  weathering of hard rock compared with the melting of snow'<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #26</ref> considering the languages even of the Elves. As a result, it remained similar to the original form taught by Aulë, even if the sundered [[:Category:Dwarven clans|clans]] developed their own dialects. Even in the [[Third Age]], the various clans could communicate easily through Kuzdul, serving as a ''lingua franca'' between them.<ref name=\"DM\" />\n\nOne of the only major phrases known to outsiders is their battle-cry: ''[[Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu!]]'' meaning ''Axes of the Dwarves! The Dwarves are upon you!''\n\n==Naming==\nThe Dwarves were secretive by nature and their native names were considered too intimate to reveal to outsiders. In public life they took external names in the language of their surroundings. It is not known if these \"outer\" names are translations of their inner names, or whether they had any relation, or not. The [[Longbeards]] for example adopted [[Northern Mannish]] names or made their own from N. Mannish elements, or even fabricated names that sounded like N. Mannish.<ref>{{App|Languages}}</ref><ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #32</ref> Dwarves would not even reveal their inner names on their tombs, since there was always a possibility that the inscription would be read by strangers. For example, [[Balin's Tomb]] displayed the outer names of [[Balin]] and [[Fundin]] rather than their inner names.  Eventually they would make use of their \"outer\" names even among themselves.<ref name=\"DM\" />\n\nThe Dwarves would re-adopt a name in consequence of some event, like a migration.<ref name=\"DM\" />\n\n==Writing==\nIt was said that the Dwarves had a complicated pictographic or ideographic writing or carving system, but this they kept resolutely secret. They did not invent an alphabetic system of their own.<ref name=\"DM\" />\n\nAround the year {{YT|1300}} the [[Dwarves of Belegost]] entered into the service of [[Thingol]] to aid in the construction of [[Menegroth]];<ref>{{GA|22}}</ref> while there they learned of the [[Cirth|Runes of Daeron]] which they were well-pleased with and took back with them.<ref>{{GA|31}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Second Age]], the [[Durin's Folk|Longbeard Dwarves]] had close association and friendship with the Elves of [[Eregion]]. In this contact the Runes in use by the Elves caught their fancy and they adopted and modified them to their own usage.<ref name=\"DM\" /> \n\nThe Longbeards would retain the use of these runes, as evidenced by Gandalf recognizing the runes of [[Daeron]] upon the tomb of Balin.\n\nThe Dwarves adopted and modified the cirth at various stages (see: [[Angerthas Moria]], [[Angerthas Erebor]]). By the [[Third Age]] the cirth were largely forgotten but by the Dwarves, so there was the misconception that the Dwarves invented them, known as \"dwarf-letters\".<ref name=\"DM\" />\n\nWhen transcribed with the Latin alphabet, *k* is used in place of *c*.<ref name=\":0\">{{App|Consonants}}</ref>\n\n==Pronunciation==\nKhuzdul did not have the sounds represented in the Latin transcription of Eldarin languages by ''kh'' (''ch'', see note above) and ''th''. Instead, these digraphs referred to the aspirated /kʰ/ and /tʰ/, respectively.<ref>{{App|Note}}</ref> Hence, the initial consonant in ''Khuzdul'' is /kʰ/, and the initial consonant in ''[[Thorin]]'' is /tʰ/.\n\nSome Dwarves used a uvular ''r'' (/ʁ/) which the Eldar found distasteful.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''Khuzdul'' (also spelled ''Khuzdûl'' in late manuscripts<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}, p. 321 (footnote 19)</ref><ref name=\"VT48\">{{VT|48a}}, pp. 6, 24</ref>) is composed of the stem ''[[Khazâd|KH-Z-D]]'', and the adjectival or genitival ending ''[[-ul]]''.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 47</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn older writings, such as ''[[The Lhammas]]'' and ''[[The Tree of Tongues]]'', Tolkien described several phyla of the [[Valarin]] language. Khuzdul, as devised by Aulë, belongs to the '''[[Aulëan]]''' phylum.\n\nOther names used by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] for the language of the Dwarves include:\n*Khazadian<ref>{{SD|Drowning}}</ref>{{rp|414}}\n*Aulian<ref name=\"lh\">{{LR|Lhammas}}</ref>{{rp|179, 197}}\n*Nauglian<ref name=\"lh\" />{{rp|197}}<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}</ref>{{rp|277}}\n*Naukarin<ref>{{PE|18}}</ref>{{rp|28–9, 81}}\n\n==Inspiration==\nKhuzdul appears to be structured, like the Semitic languages, around triconsonantal roots, such as ''kh-z-d'', ''b-n-d'', and ''z-g-l''.\n\nThe Dwarvish language sounds much like [[Hebrew]], and indeed [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] noted some similarities between the Dwarves and the Jews: both were \"''at once natives and aliens in their habitations, speaking the languages of the country, but with an accent due to their own private tongue''&hellip;\".<ref>{{L|176}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Neo-Khuzdul===\n{{seealso|Neo-Elvish}}\nFor [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] and [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]], the linguist [[David Salo]] used what little is known of Khuzdul to create enough of a language for use in the movies. This is usually referred to as neo-Khuzdul by [[Tolkienists]]. [[Gimli]] says the Neo-Khuzdul insult, ''Ishkhaqwi ai durugnul'', (commonly translated \"I spit on your grave!\") to [[Haldir]] in the extended edition of [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|''Fellowship of the Ring'']]. Salo did not provide this phrase, and it didn't fit easily into his neo-Khuzdul. When the scriptwriter for [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]] asked him about it with the idea of having Thorin use the same curse, Salo reverse-engineered Gimli's line into a neo-Khuzdul phrase ''îsh kakhfê ai-‘d-dûr-rugnul'' meaning \"May my excrement be poured upon the naked-jawed (ones)\".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=http://midgardsmal.com/gimla-ok-thorins-bǫlvan/|articlename=Gimla ok Þorins bǫlvan|dated=20-06-2014|website=Midgardsmal|accessed=23-01-2017}}</ref>\n\n==External links==\n*[[Helge Fauskanger]], ''[http://www.uib.no/people/hnohf/khuzdul.htm Khuzdul]'', [[Ardalambion]]\n*[[Magnus Åberg]], ''[http://www.forodrim.org/daeron/md_khuzdul.html An analysis of Dwarvish]'', [[Mellonath Daeron]]\n*Jay Lawson, ''[http://sites.google.com/site/quasikhuzdul/Home Quasi-Khuzdul]''\n*[http://www.jrrvf.com/~glaemscrafu/english/khuzdul.html Khuzdul sound samples] at [[Glǽmscrafu]]\n{{references}}\n{{languages}}\n[[Category:Khuzdul| ]]\n[[Category:Khuzdul words]]\n[[fr:encyclo/langues/khuzdul]]\n[[de:Khuzdul]]\n[[fi:Kääpiökieli]]"}}}
