Tolkien''''' is an art book edited by [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]], published in [[2011]].\n\nThe work reproduces, with commentary, over 100 illustrations made by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], of which all are related to ''[[The Hobbit]]''.\n\nAs stated by the authors, \"''more than two dozen of these pictures are previously unpublished, and many have never before been printed in colour.''\"<ref>[http://wayneandchristina.wordpress.com/2011/04/10/the-art-of-the-hobbit/ The Art of The Hobbit] at [http://wayneandchristina.wordpress.com/ Wayneandchristina.wordpress.com] (accessed 11 April 2011)</ref>\n\n==From the publisher==\n{{blockquote|To celebrate the 75th Anniversary of the publication of The Hobbit, a sumptuous full colour art book containing the complete collection of more than 100 Hobbit sketches, drawings, paintings and maps by J.R.R. Tolkien.\n\nWhen J.R.R. Tolkien wrote The Hobbit, he was already an accomplished amateur artist, and drew illustrations for his book while it was still in manuscript. The Hobbit as first printed had ten black and white pictures, two maps, and binding and dust-jacket designs by its author. Later, Tolkien also painted five scenes for colour plates which are some of his best work. His illustrations for The Hobbit add an extra dimension to that remarkable book, and have long influenced how readers imagine Bilbo Baggins and his world.\n\nTo celebrate the 75th anniversary of the publication of The Hobbit, the complete artwork created by the author for his story has been collected in The Art of The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien. Including related pictures, more than one hundred sketches, drawings, paintings, maps, and plans are presented here, preliminary and alternate versions and experimental designs as well as finished art. Some of these images are now published for the first time, and others for the first time in colour. Fresh digital scans from the [[Bodleian Library|Bodleian Libraries]] in Oxford and [[Marquette University]] in Wisconsin allow Tolkien’s Hobbit pictures to be seen more vividly than ever before.\n\nThe Art of The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien has been written and edited by Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull, two of the leading experts on Tolkien and authors of the acclaimed J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator, The Lord of the Rings: A Reader’s Companion, and The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide.}}\n\n==Publication history and gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"125px\" heights=\"125px\">\nFile:The Art of The Hobbit by J.R.R.
