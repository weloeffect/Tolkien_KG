The nature of the bow defined the [[Témar|téma]], or sound-series, to which a character belonged. Some curved upwards and leftwards from the stem, while others curved downwards and to the right. The lúva was sometimes 'closed' (with a horizontal bar connecting it back to the telco) or sometimes left 'open'. \n\nFor instance (using the conventions of the [[Third Age]]) all of the tengwar with an open lúva curving down and right belonged to the [[tincotéma]], the series of 't' sounds, while all those with a closed, upward, left-curling lúva were part of the [[calmatéma]] (sounds related to 'k'). \n\nThough the direction and structure of the lúva was always constant within a series, it was often 'doubled' within that series (that is, a second bow would be drawn curving out from the first). For instance, the character ''[[tinco]]'' ('t') had a single lúva, while the 'voiced' version of the same sound, ''[[ando]]'' ('d') had a double bow.<ref>{{App|Letters}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Lettering]]\n[[fi:Lúva]]"}}}
