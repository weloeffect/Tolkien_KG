It was the source of the river [[River Running|Running]] and a major [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] [[Dwarf realms|stronghold]] of the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] at the end of the [[Third Age]] and well into the [[Fourth Age|Fourth Age]].\n\n==History==\nThe [[Longbeards]] had control of Erebor since at least the early [[Second Age]].<ref>{{PM|Relations}}</ref>\n\nWith the awakening of [[Durin's Bane]] in the capital of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], [[Thráin I]] led a group of Dwarves to Erebor. Once there, the dwarves dug caves and halls to form an underground city, thus establishing the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] in {{TA|1999}}.<ref name=\"ta\">{{App|TA}}, p. 1087</ref> During Thráin's rule many riches were mined from the depths of the mountain, including the [[Arkenstone]].<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Appendix A]], \"Durin's Folk\", p. 1072</ref> \n\nThráin's son, [[Thorin I]], abandoned the Mountain in {{TA|2210}} in favour of the [[Grey Mountains]], which were largely unexplored and richer. Thorin I also hoped to reunite the [[Durin's Folk|Longbeards]]. These mountains were likely larger than Erebor; but after the [[war of the Dwarves and Dragons]] in {{TA|2590}}, King [[Thrór]] led a group back to the Lonely Mountain and re-established it as the capital of Durin's folk, though some would follow his brother [[Grór]] into the [[Iron Hills]].<ref name=\"ta\" />  \n\nErebor grew prosperous once more, and the increased prosperity of the region led to the establishment of the town of [[Dale]],<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[The Hobbit]], [[An Unexpected Party]]</ref> which was built by [[Men of Dale|Men]] between Erebor's slopes. The Dwarves mined and made larger tunnels and halls than those from their previous time in the Lonely Mountain. The Dwarves of Erebor were treated with Reverence by the Men of Dale. The Market and relationship between these two settlements was the wonder of the North. However, the happiness of this time did not last long. \n\n===[[Sack of Erebor]]===\n[[File:Donato Giancola - The Coming of Smaug.jpg|left|thumb|''The Coming of Smaug'' by [[Donato Giancola]]]]\nThe great dragon [[Smaug]] had lust for the Dwarven riches and had heard of the Prosperous Kingdom of Erebor. In {{TA|2770}} he descended on the mountain, driving out the Dwarves and destroying the town of [[Dale]].<ref>{{App|TA}}, p. 1088</ref> Afterward, Lonely Mountain was empty for almost two hundred years. Its sole inhabitant was Smaug, who slept in the innermost chamber on a great pile of wealth. None dared approached it while the Dragon lived.\n\nIn the year {{TA|2941}}, with Gandalf's council and planning, King [[Thorin II]] and a small company of friends and family actually made it to the Lonely Mountain. After the Dragon Smaug had realized that the Dwarves had been helped by the [[Lake-men]] he went to their town of [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]] intent on destroying them, only to be killed by a man named [[Bard]].<ref name=\":0\">{{App|TA}}, p. 1089</ref>\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - The Lonely Mountain.jpg|thumb|right|The Lonely Mountain sketch by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]\n===Return of the Longbeards===\nWith the help of a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] named [[Bilbo Baggins]], Thorin and company were able to retake the city and the treasure, thus allowing Thorin II to proclaim himself [[King under the Mountain]]. But, now succumbing to [[Dragon Sickness]], Thorin refused to give any of the treasure to the Men of Esgaroth. For compensation for the fallen Men of [[Esgaroth]] and [[Elves of Mirkwood]], [[Thorin and Company]] were placed under siege (not to be confused with the later [[Siege of Erebor]].)<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[File:Matt Stewart - The Battle Under the Mountain.jpg|thumb|''The Battle Under the Mountain'' by [[Matt Stewart]]]]\nThings nearly came to blows when Thorin's cousin [[Dáin Ironfoot]] (Grór's grandson) arrived as aid to his kinsman and nearly went to battle against the besiegers. But Gandalf interceded and warned them all of a great host of [[Orcs]] and [[Wargs]] coming to take the mountain. So the Elves, Men, and Dwarves made an alliance, and fought the bloody [[Battle of Five Armies|Battle of Five Armies]] against their foes in the valley before the gate.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nIn the end, the defenders were victorious against the Orcs and Wargs, thanks to the late arrivals of the [[Eagles]] and [[Beorn]]. Though the battle was won, Thorin was mortally wounded. Finally, after many years of longing, Dáin took up the kingship of Durin's folk and returned the Longbeards to the Lonely Mountain, restoring Erebor to its former glory.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Longbeards would set about the task of rebuilding their kingdom, which included various improvements to the Mountain itself. [[Glóin]] would tell [[Frodo Baggins]] of creations such as towers built on the Mountain, and roads dug deep underground.<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}, p. 229</ref> Yet neither the Lonely Mountain nor its occupants would escape the eye of the great [[Sauron|Shadow]] that rose in the last years of the Third Age.\n\nDuring the [[War of the Ring]], at the same time [[Minas Tirith]] was besieged, an army of [[Easterlings]] under [[Sauron]]'s rule invaded the [[Kingdom of Dale]] after [[Brand]] was driven back to Dale and Erebor. The Dwarves aided the [[Men of Dale]] who fought in the [[Battle of Dale|Battle of Dale]] at the feet of the Mountain for three days, before King [[Brand]] and King Dáin were killed at its very gates on [[17 March]] [[Third Age 3019|T.A. 3019]], forcing the Men and Dwarves to retreat into the mountain. They held out for several days until word reached the ears of the Easterlings that the great hosts of Sauron in the south had been defeated, causing them to despair and lose hope. When the besieged saw this they came forth from the Lonely Mountain and attacked their enemy, driving them from Dale across the river Running.<ref>{{App|TA}}, The Great Years, p. 1089</ref>\n\nErebor and Dale continued to prosper well into the [[Fourth Age]], with it still prospering and going strong even after the Longbeards reclaimed [[Khazad-dûm]].<!-- Source?-MOONBOLT -->\n\n==Geography==\n{{Sources}}\n[[File:J.R.R.
