While unrelated to [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s works, it took inspiration from it. Since [[1997]] it is owned and published by [[Wizards of the Coast]], who also publish the card game ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]''.\n\nBranching off from war games as the first published tabletop role-playing game, it paved the way for later games such as ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]''. Until [[2013]], [[Dragon Magazine]] served as one of its official periodicals.\n\n==Inspiration from Tolkien==\n''Dungeons & Dragons'', especially in its early days, borrowed liberally from various sources.<ref>[[Wikipedia:Robert J. Kuntz|Rob Kuntz]]; \"[[Tolkien in D&D|Tolkien in Dungeons & Dragons]]\" in ''[[Dragon Magazine|Dragon]]'' #13</ref><ref name=\"Dragon95\">[[Wikipedia:Gary Gygax|Gary Gygax]]; \"[[The influence of J.R.R. Tolkien on the D&D and AD&D games|On the Influence of J.R.R. Tolkien on the D&D and AD&D games]]\" in ''Dragon'' #95</ref> Its use of terms from Tolkien's works specifically came under scrutiny in [[1977]] when TSR was threatened with a lawsuit by Elan Merchandising or [[Tolkien Enterprises]]. Their primary objection concerned TSR's board game ''[[Battle of the Five Armies (board game)|The Battle of the Five Armies]]'', though they also targeted terminology within ''Dungeons & Dragons'', leading to some name changes in subsequent releases after the suit was settled:\n\n* ''[[Hobbits|Hobbit]]'' to \"[[halflings|halfling]]\"\n* ''[[Ents|Ent]]'' to \"treant\"\n* ''[[Balrogs|Balrog]]'' to \"Type VI demon [balor]\"<ref>{{Cite web|articleurl=https://www.enworld.org/threads/q-a-with-gary-gygax.22566/page-149|articlename=Q&A with Gary Gygax|author=Gygax|website=[https://www.enworld.org En World]|dated=2003}}</ref><ref>[[Michael D.C.
