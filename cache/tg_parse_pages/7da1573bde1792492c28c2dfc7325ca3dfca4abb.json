It is strongly implied in the work that he explored the world and discovered where the mysterious land of [[Faery]] lay.\n\n==History==\nAlthough Rider was known only to the people of Wootton Major as a cook, he had a long history of peregrination. Eventually he settled down in the sleepy village of Wootton Major, and held the prestigious title of Master Cook. He married a woman of the village and had a daughter, who married a man named Smith and had a young child called [[Smith Smithson]]. One day, however, Rider took a vacation, something unheard of in Wootton Major.<ref>''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]''/''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'', Thirtieth Printing [[Ballantine Books]] 1991 p. 11.</ref>\n\nHe was gone for a few months, but during that time he entered the land of Faery, met the [[Alf|King of Faery]], and picked up a [[Fay-star]]. He returned with the King of Faery disguised as a youth called Alf; it is not said whether or not Rider knew who the youth was when he first met him, but it is indicated that if not he eventually learned.<ref>ibid., p. 44. \"''He left it [the fay-star] behind in the hope that it might come to you, his only grandchild.  So he told me, for he thought that I could arrange that.''\"</ref> Alf became his apprentice. The people noted that after his return he was very merry and sang songs, but were suspicious of his choice of a \"foreigner,\" Alf, as his successor.\n\nThree years later, Rider abruptly told Alf farewell and departed, saying that he was going on a holiday and was not to return.<ref>ibid., p. 12.</ref> He entrusted Alf with the fay-star, wishing that Alf could manage it to pass to his young grandson Smith Smithson, then two years old.<ref>ibid., p. 44.</ref> A man named [[Nokes]] was made Great Cook after his departure, but nonetheless Rider got his wish and Alf caused the fay-star to go to his grandchild at [[The Feast of Good Children]].<ref>{{SOWM|Smith}}</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree |RID|y|ROS| | | |NOK| | |RID='''ROB RIDER'''|ROS=[[Rose Sangster]]|NOK=[[Nokes]]}}\n{{familytree | | | |!| | | | | | | |:| | | |}}\n{{familytree | | |DTR|y|VSM| | |:| | | |DTR=[[Ella]]|VSM=[[Joe Smith of West-side]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |!| | | |,|-|^|-|-|-|-|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree | | | | |SMI|y|NEL| | | | | |SIS|SMI=[[Smith Smithson]]|NEL=[[Nell Smithson]]|SIS=Sister}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |,|-|^|-|.| | | | | | | |!| |}}\n{{familytree | | | | |NED| |NAN|y|WRI| |TIM|NED=[[Ned Smithson]]|NAN=[[Nan Smithson]]|WRI=[[Tom Wright]]|TIM=[[Tim of Townsend]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | |TOM| | | | |TOM=[[Tom (son of Nan)|Tom]]}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Smith of Wootton Major]]"}}}
