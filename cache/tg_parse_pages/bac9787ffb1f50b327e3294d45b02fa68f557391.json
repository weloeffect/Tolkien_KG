'''Elwë''' was the son of [[Enel]] and [[Enelyë]] the third elven male and female to enter into the world. \n\n===Dwarves and death===\nThingol, after being given the golden necklace, [[Nauglamír]], by [[Húrin]] employed skilled dwarven smiths of [[Nogrod]] to restore the necklace to its former magnificance. But the [[Dwarves]], being enamoured of the beautiful treasure and the [[Silmarils|Silmaril]] it contained, sought to have it to themselves. After completing their work they refused to hand Nauglamír over, claiming he had no right to the craftsmanship of the dwarves. Thingol, percieving that they wanted the Silmaril, bade them leave his land without payment. But the smiths slew him, took the mighty jewel, and fled towards the mountains. \n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | | | THI |~|y|~| MEL | | | | | THI=[[Thingol]]| MEL=[[Melian]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | }}\n{{familytree | | BER |~|y|~| LUT | | | | | | BER=[[Beren]]| LUT=[[Lúthien]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | }}\n{{familytree | | | | | DIO |~|y|~| NIM | | | DIO=[[Dior]]| NIM=[[Nimloth]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | |,|-|-|-|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|-|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree | | ELR | | | | ELU | | | | ELW |~|y|~| EAR | |ELR=[[Eluréd]]| ELU=[[Elurín]]| ELW=[[Elwing]]| EAR=[[Eärendil]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |,|-|-|^|-|-|.|}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | | | | ELR | | | | ELS | | ELR=[[Elrond]]| ELS=[[Elros]]}}"}}}
