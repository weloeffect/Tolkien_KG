Between them, they enormously extended the South-kingdom's control over the southern lands of [[Middle-earth]], including the lands west of the [[Ethir Anduin|Mouths of Anduin]], and as far south as [[Umbar]] and the [[Harad]]. \n\nTheir influence was such that, at the end of the reign of Hyarmendacil I, Gondor had reached a peak of strength and power that it would never again surpass. Indeed, the period of the ship-kings was followed by a period of stagnation, disasters and wars, that led to its decline.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Mannish titles]]\n[[Category:Rulers of Gondor]]"}}}
