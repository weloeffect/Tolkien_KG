The Berserkers are portrayed as a [[Wikipedia:Juggernaut|juggernaut]]-type of [[Uruk-hai|Uruk]] of [[Saruman]] with a great doubly-bent two-handed sword without guards. They are shock troops and wear no armor apart from a helmet, and, according to the [[Weta Workshop]] designers, they fill it with blood before placing them on their heads and charging into battle, developing a blood-lust for their enemies.{{fact}}\n\nA ''Berserker Uruk-hai'' is also featured in [[Lego|LEGO: The Lord of the Rings]] in the set ''The Battle of Helm's Deep''.<ref name=\"2012 sets\">{{webcite|author=Calisuri|articleurl=http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2012/02/12/53563-more-lord-of-the-rings-lego-details-from-toy-fare-2012/|articlename=More Lord of the Rings LEGO Details from Toy Fare 2012|dated=12 February 2012|website=TORN|accessed=18 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The Hobbit - The Battle of the Five Armies - Gundabad Berserker.jpg|thumb|300px|A Gundabad Berserker in ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]''.]]\n\nBerserker orcs also appear in ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'', although this time they are a type of [[Mount Gundabad|Gundabad Orcs]]. They were part of [[Bolg]]'s second Orc army, and are apparently stronger than the average Gundabad Orc, with some coming close to killing [[Thorin Oakenshield]]. Unlike the Uruk berserkers, they wear armor, with some having articulated breastplates resembling faces.<ref>[[Daniel Falconer]], ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies: Chronicles: Art & Design]]'', p. 206</ref>\n\n{{references}}.\n\n[[Category:Concepts from adaptations]]"}}}
