Aranel was invented for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age]]'' by [[Electronic Arts]], where he is voiced by Rhys Lloyd.\n\n== History ==\nA scout from [[Lothlórien]], he was the brother of the warrior Idrial. He, along with a small company, was dispatched from Lórien to investigate the activities of the [[Orcs]] at the borders of their realm. He encountered a company of four — a dwarf, two men and his sister — in the [[Eastemnet]] gullies and aided them against [[Saruman]]'s [[Uruk-hai]], as well as well as rescuing a company of royal guards from [[Rohan]]. Upon reaching the borders of the land, Aranel took his leave of the company, but noted to Idrial that they would reunite in the future.\n\n{{References}}\n\n{{Title}}\n\n[[Category:Elves from adaptations]]"}}}
