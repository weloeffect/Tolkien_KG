Apart from their technical skill ... they not only in many cases correspond closely to my vision, but even enrich it. I was particularly delighted by [[Treebeard]] with [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] in his arms; but all your [[hobbits]] are admirable, and also the [[orcs]], and [[Gimli]]. I also thought the scene under \"[[Weathertop]]\" and the [[Witch-king|Witch-King]] powerful. It was tackled in the only possible way: making Frodo and the King visible and the other Companions shadowy ... [[Aragorn]] alone does not closely correspond to my vision ... I think of him as sterner, keener and in face less \"Greek\" and straight-nosed, more Roman'; Tolkien adds with regret however that 'the immediate prospects of an illustrated edition are not good'.|<ref name=Christies/>}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Letter to Doris Elizabeth Sykes (July 1956)]]\n\n{{references}}\n{{title}}\n[[Category:Letters|Sykes, Doris Elizabeth (1956-01-28)]]"}}}
