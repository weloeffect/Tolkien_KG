They would bear no man but the kings or princes of the Mark (with [[Gandalf]] as a notable exception). Their lifespan was as long as men.<ref group=\"note\">The average lifespan of those [[Kings of Rohan]] who did not die young was 82.4 years; thus the Mearas lived for eight decades.</ref><ref name=\"Eorl\">{{App|Eorl}}</ref>\n\n[[Felaróf]] and [[Snowmane]] were white, whereas [[Shadowfax]] was grey.\n\n==History==\nAccording to tradition, the ancestors of the Mearas were brought from the [[Uttermost West|West]] by [[Béma]].<ref name=\"Eorl\"/> The horses of the [[Vales of Anduin]] were special. During the [[Angmar War]], the [[Host of the West]] included noble [[Northmen]] riders, and when they landed at [[Lindon]] their horses were especially praised.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|2501}}<ref group=\"note\">Eorl was 16 when his father died.

His son, [[Eorl]], however managed to ride it and named it [[Felaróf]]. Eorl came with this horse south to [[Rohan]] and the Mearas were his descendants.
