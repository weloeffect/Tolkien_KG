It is located near the [[North Pole]]. The house has a cellar built into the cliffs.<ref name=l25>{{LFC|1925}}</ref> The house had a garden that was tended by the [[Snow Man]] but little grew except snowdrops and frost-ferns.<ref name=l26>{{LFC|1926}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nFather Christmas moved to the Cliff House in November or December of [[1925]]. He had previously lived at the [[Christmas House]] but was forced to move after the [[North Polar Bear]] had climbed the roof to try to rescue Father Christmas' hood that had blown up by the wind and had fallen through the roof and made a hole in the living room.<ref name=l25/>\n\nIn [[1932]], for several days Father Christmas and the [[North Polar Bear]] found items in the cellar missing and in disarray, originally blaming [[Paksu]] and [[Valkotukka]]. When they came down to discover all the items from the main cellar missing, the North Polar Bear said he smelled [[Orcs#Other writings|Goblin]] and they discovered a tunnel. The tunnel was too small for them to fit through but after going to the caves to confer with [[Mr Cave Bear]] they discovered a tunnel built by Goblins leading from the caves to the Cliff House's cellar.<ref>{{LFC|1932b}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1934]], Paksu and Valkotukka stole Father Christmas's paints and painted over the white walls of the cellar.<ref>{{LFC|1934b}}</ref>\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Letters from Father Christmas]]"}}}
