The name meant ''Hither Shore'' in [[Sindarin]] as opposed to the ''Distant Shore'' of [[Aman]], and the name was originally applied to all the shores of [[Beleriand]]. Some people considered the land of Nevrast to be part of Beleriand, while others considered it part of [[Hithlum]].<ref name=hithlum>{{S|14}}, p. 112</ref>\n\nNevrast was sheltered by mountains that separated it from Hithlum proper, so its weather was more like the lands of [[West Beleriand]] than the lands to its northeast. It received ample rains from the sea which drained into the great mere of [[Linaewen]] in the midst of the land, for Nevrast was enclosed by mountains with no outward flowing rivers.<ref name=\"Bel\">{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nNevrast was the first part of Beleriand the [[Noldor]] settled, but it had been previously inhabited by [[Sindar]]. Nevrast's population was soon very mixed, far more so than any other region of Beleriand.\n\nNevrast was the centre of an [[Elves|Elven]] kingdom of [[Turgon]] for about a century until ca. {{FA|116}}, when the people began their trek to [[Gondolin]].<ref>{{S|Noldor}}</ref> Turgon's capital (and it seems the only city of Nevrast) was [[Vinyamar]].<ref name=\"Bel\"/> The land was not permanently inhabited after that, and indeed was utterly abandoned until [[Tuor]] came there, guided by [[Ulmo]].<ref>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n\nAn early, rejected form of the name ''Nevrast'' was ''Nivrost'' (\"West Vale\" or \"West-dales\").<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, p. 256</ref><ref>{{WJ|Index}}</ref><ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 29</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Haerast]]'', the Far Shore\n\n{{references}}\n{{navigation\n| title= Nevrast\n| north-west= [[Helcaraxe]]\n| north= [[Lammoth]]\n| north-east= [[Hithlum]]\n| west= [[Belegaer]]\n| east= [[Doriath]]\n| south-west=\n| south= [[Falas]]\n| south-east= [[Nargothrond]]\n|}}\n[[Category:Beleriand]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[Category:Elven realms]]\n\n[[de:Nevrast]]\n[[fi:Nevrast]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/regions/beleriand/nevrast]]"}}}
