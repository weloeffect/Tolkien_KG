It gave its name to the [[Gulf of Lune]] and the [[Blue Mountains|Mountains of Lune]]. Of old, the Lhûn had been a line of defence: first against Sauron, and later against the [[Witch-king]].\n\n==Geography==\nThe Lhûn found its origin in the [[First Age]] or before. The river had its sources in the far north of the Blue Mountains, and had two tributaries: the [[Little Lune]] and an unnamed river that had its origin in the [[Hills of Evendim|Emyn Uial]]. \n\nIts original course is no longer recorded in history, but following the [[War of Wrath]], its course was severely altered; after the breaking of the Blue Mountains, it flowed in the newly-formed [[Gulf of Lune]].<ref name=rings>{{S|Rings}}</ref> \n\n==History==\nIn the [[Second Age]], the Lhûn formed the border between eastern [[Lindon]] and [[Arnor]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref> [[Elendil]]'s [[Arnorians|people]] dwelt about the courses of the Lhûn.<ref name=rings/> During [[Sauron]]'s advent, [[Gil-galad]] and Elendil were desperately protecting the [[Grey Havens]], and managed to hold the Lhûn.<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Angmar War|War with Angmar]], it formed the end of the [[Witch-king]]'s influence: many of the Dúnedain fled across it. When [[Eärnil II]] came, passage was won back over it. With their defeat imminent, many of the Witch-king's minions drowned in the river Lhûn.<ref>{{HM|AA}}, \"Gondor and the Heirs of Anarion\"</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe meaning of ''Lhûn'' is not known. In connection with its first appearance, in a manuscript dating from ca. 1940, the translation \"Blue River\" is given.<ref>{{HM|TI}}, \"VI. The Council of Elrond (1): The Third Version, (iii)\", p. 124</ref><ref name=VT48a5>{{VT|48a5}}</ref> Apparently, Tolkien originally envisioned it as [[Noldorin]] for \"blue\" (cf.
