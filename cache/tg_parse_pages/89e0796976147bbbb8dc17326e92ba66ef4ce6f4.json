It was traversed by a portion of the [[Harad Road]] from the [[Crossings of Poros]] to the [[Cross-roads]]; there was another road to [[Pelargir]]. Its most notable feature was the hills of [[Emyn Arnen]].<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Ithilien (South) map.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of South Ithilien in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2015: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:South Ithilien was an area in the Eastern [[Gondor]] region. It consisted of [[Emyn Arnen]] and surrounding lands, directly across the river from [[Lossarnach]] and the [[Pelennor Fields]]. It was connected to Lossarnach in the south-west by crossing the river and to [[Osgiliath]] in the north-west. A cliff in the south prevented access to Ithilien south of [[Lossarnach]]. The [[Rangers of Ithilien]] in the area had their main camp in the ruins of \"Bâr Húrin\", the abandoned estate of the [[House of Húrin|House of the Stewards]], and a smaller camp in the north nearer to Osgiliath.\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Regions of Gondor]]\n[[de:Ithilien]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/regions/gondor/ithilien]]\n[[fi:Etelä-Ithilien]]"}}}
