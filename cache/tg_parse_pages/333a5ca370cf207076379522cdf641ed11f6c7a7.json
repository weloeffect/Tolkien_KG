The name is modernised, because it was recognisable by speakers of [[Westron]]. [[Gondorians]] used that name, assimilated to their own language.<ref>{{HM|N}}, entry '''Entwade''', pp. 769-70</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2012: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Despite the Entwash being the shallowest in this spot, the Entwade crossing is only made possible by the wooded raft-bridges that connect both banks to a small island in the middle. The crossing itself is guarded by the town also called Entwade on the western bank, and only those granted leave are allowed to cross.\n\n{{references|note}}\n[[Category:Fords]]\n[[Category:Rohan]]"}}}
