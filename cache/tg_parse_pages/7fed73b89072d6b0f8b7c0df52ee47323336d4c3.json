[[Orcs]] had befouled the statue; its head had been knocked off and replaced by a stone effigy.\n\nOn their way to [[Mordor]], [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], and [[Gollum]] came to the Cross-roads around [[10 March]]. They were in a belt of trees of vast size. Next to the road leading to [[Osgiliath]] they found the defiled statue, but seeing its fallen head gave Frodo hope, for nature crowned it with flowers.<ref>{{TT|IV7}}</ref>\n\nSometime later, in the evening of [[18 March]], a vanguard of [[Army of the West]] passed by the Cross-roads. [[Aragorn]] ordered a fanfare of trumpeteers and ceremoniously reclaimed the lands in the name of the Lords of Gondor. Soldiers broke the defiling stone-head and restored the statue also washing the scrawls away.\n\nThe [[March 19|next day]] they were joined by the main Host. Before leaving, they stationed a strong force of archers there, to guard against any attack from the East or South, and resumed their course towards [[Mordor]].<ref>{{RK|V10}}</ref>\n\n==Inconsistencies==\n\nThe statue of the Fallen King is said to have a carven beard in the text.<ref>{{TT|IV7}}</ref> However, in a note published in ''[[The Nature of Middle-earth]]'', Tolkien stated that the kingly line of Númenor (and subsequently Gondor and Arnor) would be unable to grow beards due to their Elvish ancestry.<ref>{{NM|P2v}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===The Cross-roads in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King - Crossroads of the Fallen Kings.png|[[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Gollum]] at the Cross-roads in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Cross-roads.jpg|Statue of the King restored in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n'''2015: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Cross-roads exist in both pre-battle and post-[[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] versions of [[Ithilien]].
