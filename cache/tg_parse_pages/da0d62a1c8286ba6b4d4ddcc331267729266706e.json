This book is an account of the [[Inklings]], a literary discussion group associated with the [[University of Oxford]], of which [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[C.S. Lewis]], and [[Charles Williams]] were some of its prominent members.\n\nIt includes a large number of previously unpublished extracts from letters and other writings by J.R.R. Tolkien, including a [[A Closed Letter to Andrea Charicoryides Surnamed Polygrapheus, Logothete of the Theme of Geodesia in the Empire, Bard of the Court of Camelot, Malleus Malitiarium, Inclinga Sum Sometimes Known as Charles Williams|poem]] to Charles Williams. Also includes a reproduction of a note to Dr. Warfield M. Firor from the Inklings, to which Tolkien added his name and a potted four line biography.\n\n==Contents==\n*Part One\n**\"Oh for the people who speak one's own language\"\n**\"What?

Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien and their friends were a regular feature of the Oxford scenery in the years during and after the Second World War. They drank beer on Tuesdays at the ‘Bird and Baby’, and on Thursday nights they met in Lewis’ Magdalen College rooms to read aloud from the books they were writing; jokingly they called themselves ‘The Inklings’.<br>\nC.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien first introduced The Screwtape Letters and The Lord of the Rings to an audience in this company and Charles Williams, poet and writer of supernatural thrillers, was another prominent member of the group.<br>\nHumphrey Carpenter, who wrote the acclaimed biography of J.R.R. Tolkien, draws upon unpublished letters and diaries, to which he was given special access, in this engrossing story.}}\n\n==Publication history and gallery==\n;UK editions\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"125px\" heights=\"125px\">\nFile:Inklings 1978.gif|1978 hardcover\nFile:Inklings 1981.png|1981 paperback\nFile:Inklings 1997.png|1997 paperback\nFile:Inklings 2006.jpeg|2006 paperback\nFile:Inklings 2024.jpeg|2024 paperback\n</gallery>\n*[[George Allen and Unwin]] hardcover ([[1978]]), pp.&nbsp;287.
