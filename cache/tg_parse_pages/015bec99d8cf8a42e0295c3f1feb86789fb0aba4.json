Unlike the ''[[kelvar]]'', they are inanimate. [[Trees]] are the highest of the olvar.\n\nYavanna had sown seeds early in the [[Spring of Arda]], and they sprouted and burgeoned quickly; mosses, grasses, great ferns and trees. Flowers and birds \"waited still their time in the bosom of Yavanna; but wealth there was of her imagining\" and they came later.<ref>{{S|Days}}</ref> After the destruction of the [[Two Lamps]], the [[Middle-earth|Great Lands]] were left in darkness, and Yavanna protected the olvar by setting them to sleep and they did not grow until light should come again.<ref name=c3>{{S|3}}</ref> However, there were still kelvar in [[Valinor]]; and in [[Nan Elmoth]] the trees grew tall while [[Thingol]] was entranced by [[Melian]].<ref>{{S|Thingol}}</ref>\n\nAfter her husband [[Aulë]] created the [[Fathers of the Dwarves]], she became concerned for the fate of both the [[kelvar]] (animals) and olvar (plants) at the hands of their descendants. She spoke of her fears to [[Manwë]], who revealed that [[Ilúvatar|Eru]] intended that spirits should be sent to dwell among some of the olvar and protect them. This was the ultimate origin of the beings who came to be known as [[Ents]].<ref>{{S|Aule}}</ref>\n==Etymology==\n''Olvar'' is [[Quenya]], glossed as \"growing things with roots in the earth\".<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> \n\nThere is a similarity to other relevant words (perhaps variants) such as ''olwa''<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry [[GÓLOB]]</ref> and ''olba''<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, p.340</ref> which are however glossed as \"branch\".<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/quen-eng.htm|website=Arda|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articlename=Quettaparma Quenyallo}}</ref>\nIn ''[[The Etymologies]]'', ''olwa'' is derived from the [[root]] [[GÓLOB]].\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Plants]]"}}}
