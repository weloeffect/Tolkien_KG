His father's office passed to his elder brother [[Isengrim Took III|Isengrim III]], but because of their father's longevity, Isengrim's reign did not last long. As he left no heir, Isumbras became [[Thain]] at the age of ninety-two, even older than his brother was. He served for nine years before he died, and the office passed to his son [[Fortinbras Took II|Fortinbras II]].<ref>{{App|Took}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n\"Isumbras\" is of French and [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] origin and means \"iron-arm\". It comes from the French ''bras'' meaning \"arm\", and the Anglo-Saxon and Middle High German word ''[[isen]]'' which means \"iron\".<ref>[[Jim Allan]], ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', \"Giving of Names\"</ref>\n\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] likely got the name from ''[[wikipedia:Sir Isumbras|Sir Isumbras]]'', an English medieval romance about a man who suffers a lifetime of hardship but who finds happiness in his latter years.\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | | | FOO | | | | | | | | | FOO=[[Fortinbras Took I|Fortinbras I]]<br/><small>''1145 - 1248''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | OLD |y| ADA | | | | | OLD=[[Gerontius Took|The Old Took]]<br/><small>''1190 - 1320''</small>|ADA=[[Adamanta Chubb]]<br/><small>''unknown''</small>}}\n{{familytree | |,|-|-|-|v|-|^|-|v|-|-|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree | ISE | | HIL | | ISU | | NIN | ISE=[[Isengrim Took III|Isengrim III]]<br/><small>''1232 - 1330''</small>|HIL=[[Hildigard Took|Hildigard]]<br/><small>''(died young)''</small>|ISU='''ISUMBRAS IV'''<br><small>''1238 - 1339''</small>|NIN=''9 children''}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | LAL |y| FOR | | | | | LAL=[[Lalia Clayhanger]]<br/><small>''1283 - 1402''</small>|FOR=[[Fortinbras Took II|Fortinbras II]]<br/><small>''1278 - 1380''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | FER | | | | | | | FER=[[Ferumbras Took III|Ferumbras III]]<br/><small>''1316 - 1415''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n{{references}}\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n| race=hobbit\n| house=[[Took Family]]\n| born={{SR|1238}}\n| died={{SR|1339}}\n}}\n{{Seq\n| prev=[[Isengrim Took III]]\n| list=28th [[Thain]] of [[The Shire]]\n| dates={{SR|1330}} - {{SR|1339|n}}\n| next=[[Fortinbras Took II|Fortinbras&nbsp;Took&nbsp;II]]\n}}\n{{Seq-end}}\n{{thains}}\n[[Category:Greco-Roman names]]\n[[Category:Hobbits]]\n[[Category:Old English names]]\n[[Category:Thains]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[Category:Took]]\n\n[[de:Isumbras Tuk IV.]]\n[[fi:Isumbras IV Tuk]]"}}}
