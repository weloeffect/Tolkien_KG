Eventually they decide to keep it for themselves, mischievously citing the idea that it could be a 'distant relative' of his.\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The smoke from Longbottom Leaf takes the form of a horizontal smoke ring that appears behind the character's head. This effect appears to be broken or bugged. From the front, only the default cloud of thick smoke can be seen. \n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Pipe-weed]]\n[[de:Langgrundblatt]]\n[[fi:Pitkänpohjan pehku]]"}}}
