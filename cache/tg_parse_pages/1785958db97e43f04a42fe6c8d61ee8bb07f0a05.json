After the [[Exile of the Noldor]] and the first rising of the [[Moon]], the [[Valar]] elected to shield their realm from the outside world. They enmeshed these seas with a bewildering shadow - the source of their name - and created a chain of [[Enchanted Isles]], each of which had the power to ensnare any mariner braving this region.<ref>{{S|Sun}}</ref> Throughout the centuries that followed, no ship reached the shores of [[Aman]], until [[Eärendil]] finally succeeded in passing through the shadows of the Shadowy Seas.<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref>\n\n==In other stories==\nThe Shadowy Seas are referenced in Tolkien's ''[[Roverandom]]''. In the story, written down in [[1927]], the great whale [[Uin]] takes the enchanted dog [[Rover]]andom (formerly known as Rover) on adventures through the seas: Uin takes Roverandom through the Shadowy Seas to the [[Bay of Eldamar|Bay of Fairyland]] beyond the [[Enchanted Isles|Magic Isles]] where Rover saw the [[Pelóri|Mountains of Elvenhome]] and the light of Faery. Roverandom thought he could see the white glint of [[Tirion|a city of Elves on a green hill far away in the distance]].<ref name=\"Roverandom\">{{HM|R}}, pp. 73-4</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Sindanórie]]\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Roverandom]]\n[[Category:Seas and oceans]]"}}}
