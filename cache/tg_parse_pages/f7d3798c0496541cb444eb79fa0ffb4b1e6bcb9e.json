The river [[Anduin]] flowed through the hills and then pooled in [[Nen Hithoel]].<ref name=\"Map\">{{UT|Map}}</ref> The [[Fellowship of the Ring]] rode boats through Emyn Muil<ref name=\"River\">{{FR|II9}}</ref> before the group broke up near the southern boundary of the hills.<ref name=\"Break\">{{FR|II10}}</ref>  Afterwards [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] hiked through the difficult terrain east of the river and met [[Gollum]] just below the eastern edge of the Emyn Muil.<ref name=\"Taming\">{{TT|IV1}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\nThe hills rose gradually in the north with great brakes thorn and sloe, brambles and creepers.  Near the river ivy clung to grey stone chimneys and further ridges were topped with firs twisted by wind.<ref name=\"River\"/>  On three sides Emyn Muil ended in cliffs:  In the west the uplands ended abruptly in the [[East Wall of Rohan]].<ref>{{TT|III2}}</ref> In the south the [[Anduin]] cascaded over [[Rauros]], a great waterfall.<ref>{{FR|II8}}</ref>  In the east, although of lower elevation, the barren hills still ended in a steep edge.<ref name=\"Taming\"/>\n\nThe [[Anduin]] cut through the hills on its southward course. In the north the river narrowed and passed through [[Sarn Gebir]]. No boats could survive these rapids and travelers had to use a portage way on the west bank. South of Sarn Gebir the river plunged between towering cliffs until it passed between the two great statues of the [[Argonath]].  A little further and the pent waters opened into a long oval lake called [[Nen Hithoel]]. On the southern end of the lake were three peaks: [[Amon Lhaw]] on the east bank, [[Tol Brandir]] amid two arms of the river, and [[Amon Hen]] on the western side. At the foot of Amon Hen was a green clearing, [[Parth Galen]], and south of it was the [[North Stair]] that allowed for passage to the bottom of Rauros and Emyn Muil.<ref name=\"River\"/>\n\n== History ==\nAfter Prince [[Rómendacil II|Minalcar]] of [[Gondor]] had defeated a large army of [[Easterlings]] in {{TA|1248}} (and took the name  Rómendacil) he fortified the west bank of the Anduin and built the pillars of the Argonath in the Emyn Muil.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|2510|n}}, the Steward [[Cirion]] bequeathed the land of [[Calenardhon]] to [[Eorl|Eorl the Young]].  After pledging the [[Oath of Eorl]] the bounds of the new realm of [[Rohan]] were determined; in the east these were the Anduin and the [[East Wall of Rohan|west-cliff]] of the Emyn Muil.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, ''(iii) Cirion and Eorl''</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|3002|n}} [[Orc]] raiders battled with some [[Rohirrim]], and [[Éomund]] was slain there.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>\n\n[[Aragorn]] captured [[Gollum]] on [[1 February]],<ref name=\"Hunt\">{{UT|Hunt}},  ''(ii) Other Versions of the Story''</ref> {{TA|3017|n}} in the [[Dead Marshes]].<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>  To avoid detection by the spies of [[Sauron]], Aragorn drove his captive through the northern Emyn Muil before crossing the Anduin.<ref name=\"Hunt\"/>\n\nIn {{TA|3019}} the Fellowship of the Ring encountered the Emyn Muil.
