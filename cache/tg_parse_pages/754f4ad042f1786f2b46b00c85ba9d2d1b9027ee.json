It was an ancient high rampart made from earth behind a trench that stretched across the Deeping-coomb for a mile or more from one side of the valley to the other side. The [[Deeping-stream]] beside the [[Deeping-road]] ran from Helm's Deep through a wide breach in the rampart further down the Deeping-coomb.<ref name=Deep>{{TT|Deep}}, p. 530</ref>\n\n==History==\nOn [[3 March]] {{TA|3019}}<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019, March 3, p. 1093</ref> King [[Théoden]] with [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], [[Gimli]], [[Éomer]], and other [[Rohirrim|riders]] hurried to reach [[Helm's Deep]] before the army of [[Saruman]] could overtake them. When they came to the rampart the defenders of the dike were greatly cheered to learn of the arrival of the king, who stopped to learn of news.<ref name=Deep/>\n\nIn the early stages of the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], [[Orcs]] attacked the reargard<ref name=Deep/> of the Rohirrim at the dike during the night. [[Gamling]] commanded the defence of the dike during which the archers of the rearguard used all their arrows and filled the dike with downed Orcs, but the defenders soon had to retreat on horses back to the Hornburg.<ref>{{TT|Deep}}, p. 531</ref>\n\nThe next morning, the defenders counter-attacked the orcs and [[Dunlendings]] and drove them over the Dike. Then, the king and his company stopped in amazement, for a quarter mile beyond the Dike was a new, nameless wood. In the space between the host of Saruman was caught in panic until, with the arrival of [[Gandalf]] and [[Erkenbrand]], the orcs fled into the forest.<ref>{{TT|Deep}}, pp. 540-42</ref>\n\nAs the victors rested, those who had been driven back into the caves (Gamling, Éomer, and Gimli among them) came over the wall to greet their friends.<ref>{{TT|Road}}, pp. 543-44</ref> In the middle of the field between the Hornburg and Helm's Dike two burial mounds, one for the men from the [[Westfold]] and one for the men from the [[East Dales]] were raised while a mound for the men from [[Dunland]] was erected below the dike.<ref>{{TT|Road}}, p. 545</ref> Later, near sunset, Théoden, Gandalf, and the others left the Dike on their way to [[Isengard]].<ref>{{TT|Road}}, p. 546</ref> In the middle of the night between [[3 March]] and [[4 March]] {{TA|3019}}<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> men in the Hornburg heard a great noise in the valley and the ground trembled. In the next morning they discovered that the new wood had disappeared and that someone, probably the [[Huorns]],<ref>{{RK|Company}}, p. 777</ref> had dug a huge pit below the dike and had piled up stones into a hill over it, which was called the Death Down, because it was believed that the dead Orcs had been buried there.<ref>{{TT|Road}}, p. 553</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe element ''Helm'' in the name ''Helm's Dike'' refers to the name of a man called Helm.<ref>{{HM|N}}, '''Helm's Deep, Helm's Dike, Helm's Gate''', entry, p. 772</ref> The gorge behind the Hornburg was called Helm's Deep after King [[Helm]] of Rohan sought refuge in the Hornburg when his realm was invaded by the ursurper [[Wulf]] and the Dunlendings.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}, entry for King Helm, p. 1066</ref> As a consequence, it is probable that the element ''Helm'' in the name ''Helm's Dike'' also refers to King Helm of Rohan.\n\n== Portrayal in adaptations ==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Deeping-coomb.jpg|thumb|250px|Helm's Dike in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2013: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Helm's Dike is one of the five major battlegrounds in the game's representation of the [[Battle of the Hornburg]].\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Rohan]]\n[[Category:Walls]]\n[[de:Helms Deich]]\n[[fi:Helmin valli]]"}}}
