Their lyrics are inspired by the work of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].\n\n==History==\nThe group formed in [[1989]] under the name Angelica. They changed their name to \"Minas Tirith\" for the release of a demo cassette, entitled ''Tales From the Woods'' in late [[1992]]. By the release of their second demo in 1995 the band had again changed their name, to \"Vergelmir\". They were inactive in the studio for a few more years until, as \"Wuthering Heights\", they released the album ''Within'' in [[1999]]. They followed this up with ''To Travel For Evermore'' in [[2002]] and ''Far From the Madding Crowd'' in [[2004]], which has received some critical acclaim amid the underground power metal and folk metal communities. In the summer of [[2004]] the band played outside Europe for the first time. The gig took place at the ProgPower festival in Atlanta, GA. The band's fourth release was ''The Shadow Cabinet'' from [[2006]].\n\n== Current line-up ==\n*Nils Patrik Johansson - Vocals\n*Erik Ravn - Guitars, Bass, Keys, Vocals\n*Martin Arendal - Guitars\n*Andreas Lindahl - Keys\n*Teddy Möller - Bass\n*Morten Gade Sørensen - Drums, Percussion\n\n== Discography ==\n* [[1999]] - ''Within''\n* [[2002]] - ''To Travel for Evermore''\n* [[2004]] - ''Far From the Madding Crowd''\n* [[2006]] - ''The Shadow Cabinet''\n\n== External links ==\n*'''[http://www.wuthering-heights.dk Official Website]'''\n\n[[Category:Bands]]\n[[Category:Heavy metal]]"}}}
