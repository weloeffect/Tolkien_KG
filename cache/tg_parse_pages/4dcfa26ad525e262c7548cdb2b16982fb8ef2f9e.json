Because [[Morgoth]] tainted [[Arda]] with his rebellious spirit, his will could continue to affect the hearts of people living on Earth after he was gone. At different points, the Shadow refers to the Darkness of the Enemy, [[Sauron]] or their servants, the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]], also called \"Shadows\" (and their [[Black Breath]]). Sauron was called the \"Shadow of the Forest\" (while he dwelt in [[Dol Guldur]]) or the \"Shadow of the East\" (in [[Mordor]]). Shadow also described the [[Unlight]] of [[Ungoliant]].\n\n\"Shadows\" was also a name for the [[Oathbreakers]], having become [[Wraiths]], also called \"Shadow-hosts\", or \"Shadow-men.\"\n\nPeoples that came under the sway of this corrupting power were said to be \"under the Shadow\". The term is also a euphemism that alludes to the seduction of [[Men]] by Morgoth in the beginning of their history: \"''Men came forth in the East of the world; but they fell under the shadow of the [[Morgoth|Enemy]]''\". This usage is similar to the other examples above, but is more far-reaching in that all Men living at that time were said to have succumbed to Morgoth's power. The Men fell under the Shadow already in [[Hildórien]] and became afraid of the [[Gift of Men]]. A similar fear came in the realm of [[Númenor]] when its people became restless and began to envy the [[immortality]] of the [[Elves]].\n\nA few kindred of [[Dwarves]] also fell under the Shadow, especially among those clans that lived in the mountains to the far east of Middle-earth. Some Dwarves fought on Sauron's side during the [[War of the Last Alliance|War of the]] [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|Last Alliance]].\n\nThough the Shadow was less evident among populations of the Elves, the Shadow of the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë|Kinslaying]] lay upon the kindred of the [[Noldor]]. \n\nThe Shadow, however, also referred to more concrete and evident things, like the Shadow covering Mordor, the [[Storm of Mordor]] that covered [[Gondor]] on the [[Dawnless Day]].<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Return of the King]]'', \"[[The Siege of Gondor]]\"</ref>\n\nWhen he met [[Durin's Bane]], [[Gandalf]] expelled it to return to the Shadow it came from, perhaps the [[Void]].<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', \"[[The Bridge of Khazad-dûm]]\", pp. 330-1</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Quest of the Ring]], a mysterious [[Shadow over Hollin|shadow]] passed over the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] in the night, darkening the stars as it moved over [[Eregion|Hollin]]. The origin of this shadow is unclear, as it was moving fast and against the wind.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', \"[[The Ring Goes South]]\" p. 286</ref>\n\nAfter the passing of Sauron, the Shadow was lifted from the hearts of the [[Free Peoples]] and they managed to fight the remnants of his forces.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>\n\nIn more general applications, \"Shadow\" is a term that apparently refers to the bewilderment and darkness accompanying certain enchantments. [[Sauron|Sauron's]] tower of [[Barad-dûr]] was surrounded by Shadow, and the word is also associated with the land of [[Lothlórien]] and with the [[Ents]].\n\n[[Saruman]] referred to the [[Ents]] and [[Huorns]] as the \"Shadow of the Wood\".<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[The Lord of the Rings|''The Lord of the Rings'']], [[The Two Towers|''The Two Towers'']], \"[[The Voice of Saruman]]\", p. 580</ref>\n \n==In other languages==\n*In [[Quenya]], the word ''huine'' meaning \"darkness, gloom\" is used with negative connotations such as [[Sauron]]. The word ''unuhuine'' is used to refer to Númenor \"under the Shadow\".<ref>{{LR|P1III2}}, p. 47</ref>\n*In [[Adûnaic]], the word of the same meaning is ''ugru''. The expression \"under shadow\" is ''ugru-dalad''.<ref>{{HM|SD}}, p. 247</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n*{{HM|Guide}}, pp.&nbsp;349–351\n[[Category:Concepts]]\n[[Category:Evil]]"}}}
