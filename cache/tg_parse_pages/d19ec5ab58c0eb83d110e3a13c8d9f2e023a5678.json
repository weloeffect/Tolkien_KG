She bade him deliver them to [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], and [[Gimli]], a task Gandalf accomplished when he met them at last in [[Fangorn Forest]].<ref>{{TT|III5}}, p. 502-3</ref> Aragorn's message was prophetic in nature, referring to the meeting of the [[Grey Company]] and his taking of the [[Paths of the Dead]]. Legolas's message would prove to be a warning, for when he was at [[Pelargir]] he heard the cry of the gulls, which awakened the [[Sea-longing]] dormant in the hearts of Elves.<ref>{{RK|Debate}}, p. 873</ref> Gimli's message was one of encouragement, for he bore three locks of Galadriel's hair.<ref>{{FR|Farewell}}, p. 376</ref>\n\n'''Aragorn'''\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nWhere now are the Dúnedain, Elessar, Elessar? \nWhy do thy kinsfolk wander afar? \nNear is the hour when the Lost should come forth, \nAnd the Grey Company ride from the North. \nBut dark is the path appointed for thee: \nThe Dead watch the road that leads to the Sea. \n</poem>\n'''Legolas'''\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nLegolas Greenleaf long under tree \nIn joy thou hast lived.
