Thus, Eä is ''the World that Is'', as distinguished from the [[Timeless Halls]] of [[Ilúvatar]] and the [[Void]], that have no material form.\n==Creation==\nEä was conceived in the [[Music of the Ainur]] and then visualized in the beautiful [[Vision of Ilúvatar|Vision]] that Ilúvatar showed to the Ainur to see for themselves what they sang. The Vision showed a world sustained inside the void, but without being part of it, and developing life on its own. The Ainur desired all this to be real, and Ilúvatar brought this into actuality by saying ''[[ea (verb)|Eä]]'' and sent His [[Flame Imperishable]] into the Void to burn at the heart of the World.

But the ''axani'' are limited with the ''[[únat]]i'', physical laws that are impossible to break by all beings, no matter how powerful or evil.<ref>{{NM|P2ix}}, pp. 205-218</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Ea.mp3|Ardamir}}\n''[[ea (verb)|Eä]]'' is the [[Quenya]] verb \"to be\", and was the word spoken by Eru Ilúvatar by which He created the universe.\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n\nIn earlier works, the [[Qenya]] word ''[[Ilu]]'' is translated as \"world\"<ref>{{SM|5d}}</ref> in the sense of the \"universe\", from the [[root]] ILU \"all, the whole\".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry [[IL]]</ref> \n\nIn the 1930s [[Ambarkanta]], the World is described as a globe of air enclosed in [[Vaiya]] and the [[Ilurambar]], the Walls of the World that separate Vaiya from nothingness and the Void.<ref>{{SM|5b}}</ref> The [[Ambarkanta maps]] schematics are labelled as \"ILU\".<ref>{{SM|A1}}</ref><ref>{{SM|A2}}</ref> \n\nAs the word Ilu doesn't make a distinction between the concepts of \"Arda\" and \"Eä\" of the later ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', the two seem to be mostly equated; in that context, all the universe consists only of [[Ambar]] and the airs around it.\n\nEä first appeared in a later version of the Ainulindalë, which here introduced the new concept of Arda set within an indefinite vastness of the Creation.<ref>{{MR|P1e}}</ref> Around the same time, Tolkien changed the conception of Ilurambar to Eärambar.<ref>{{MR|P2c}}, p. 63</ref>\n\nIn the later [[Round World version of the Silmarillion]], the text mentions that Eä is vast beyond measure with the stars belonging to other and remoter parts of its Great Tale.
