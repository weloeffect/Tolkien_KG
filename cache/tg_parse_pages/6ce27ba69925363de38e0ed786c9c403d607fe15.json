He had gotten his nickname for his gloomy disposition and his propensity for foretelling disasters.  Despite his reluctance he was persuaded to improvise a suit of mail for [[Farmer Giles]] by sewing discarded metal rings on an old leather jerkin and breeches.  The smith even supplied an old iron frame of a helmet that the cobbler covered with leather.\n\nWhenever trouble appeared in the tale Sunny Sam became more cheerful, but when things appeared to be going well the blacksmith turned dour.  Eventually, when Farmer Giles became king, he outlawed unpleasant prophecy and Fabricius Cunctator changed his profession to the perhaps more suitable one of undertaker.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]''</ref>\n\n''Fabricius Cunctator'' is a pun on the name of Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, a Roman general of the third century BC, who acquired the nickname ''Cunctator'', meaning \"Delayer,\" for the defensive strategy he employed against the Carthaginian army led by Hannibal in the Second Punic War. ''Fabricius'' is the Latin word for \"blacksmith.\"\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Farmer Giles of Ham]]\n[[Category:Greco-Roman names]]\n[[Category:Smiths]]\n[[fi:Sam (Maamies ja lohikäärme)]]"}}}
