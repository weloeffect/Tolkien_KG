[[Maiar|Maia]] of the [[Inner Seas]] associated with [[Ulmo]].\n\n==Attributes==\nOssë was a vassal of Ulmo, but he loved the winds and preferred the coasts and isles of [[Middle-earth]]<ref name=\"s3\" /> over the deeps of his master. There was some darkness and violence in his spirit, presumably after his seduction by [[Morgoth|Melkor]], and he enjoyed raging in storms despite the will of Ulmo; only his spouse, [[Uinen]], could restrain his wild urges. He obeyed the will of [[Mandos]]<ref>{{UT|1}}</ref> and was a friend of all mariners, but they didn't trust his unpredictable temperament.<ref name=\"vala\">{{S|IIc}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIt was said that during the early days of [[Arda]], Ossë turned to [[Morgoth|Melkor]] for a time, but Uinen brought him back to the loyalty of Ulmo. However, Ossë's wild and wilful nature was still evident despite remaining loyal to Ulmo.<ref name=\"vala\" />\n\nDuring the [[Great March]] of the [[Eldar]] to [[Valinor]], Ossë was sent to befriend the [[Lindar]], the clan of the Eldar who lingered by the shores of [[Belegaer]] on their way, and he taught them sea-lore and sea-music. When Ulmo returned with the floating island for them to resume their trip to the west, Ossë (who loved the shores of Middle-earth) did not wish to part with his friends; he persuaded some, like [[Círdan]], to remain there, at the [[Falas]] and the [[Bay of Balar]]. These afterwards became the [[Falathrim]].<ref name=\"s3\" /> \n\n[[File:Steamey - Ossë and the Teleri.jpg|thumb|left|Steamey - ''Ossë and the Teleri'']]\n\nAs Ulmo ferried the floating island with [[Olwë]] and his Lindar to [[Eldamar]], they heard Ossë's song and begged Ulmo to stop off the shore, which he did. Ossë fastened the island to the bottom, and it became [[Tol Eressëa]], the lonely isle off the [[Bay of Eldamar]]. However soon the [[Falmari]] of the island longed for the splendour and [[Light of Valinor]] and wished to see their kindred there. Grieving, Ossë submitted to the will of the Valar and Ulmo, and taught them ship-building and offered them [[Swans]] to draw them to Valinor.<ref name=\"s3\">{{S|Princes}}</ref>\n\nWith his master, Ossë often visited [[Nevrast]] and the feet of Mount [[Taras]] in [[Middle-earth]], and many [[Sindar]] were concentrated to that place.<ref>{{S|14}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[First Kinslaying]], [[Olwë]] called upon Ossë against the [[Noldor]], but he came not, as the Valar did not wish to hinder the [[Flight of the Noldor]] with violence.<ref>{{S|9}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Valar]] pronounced the [[Doom of the Noldor]], Ossë helped guard the shores of [[Beleriand]] to keep the ships of the Noldor from reaching [[Valinor]]. His storms had a part in wrecking all the ships that they sent, and only one [[Elves|Elf]] from among their crews survived, by the will of Ulmo: [[Voronwë]].<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Second Age]] he raised the island of [[Elenna]] ([[Númenor]]) from the depths of the Sea.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| OSS |~| UIN | |OSS='''OSSË'''|UIN=[[Uinen]]}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Etymology==\nAt least two explanations exist for the name ''Ossë''. In ''[[The Etymologies]]'', it is understood as the [[Qenya]] word ''osse'' (\"terror\"), deriving from the [[Sundocarme|root]] GOS (\"dread\").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 359</ref> \n\nA later note pertaining to the name instead suggests it is a name of non-Elvish origin, deriving from [[Valarin]] ''Oš(o)šai'' (\"spuming, foaming\").<ref name=\"WJ\">{{WJ|Quendi}}, p. 400</ref> The same later note mentions that Ossë's [[Sindarin]] names were '''''Gaerys''''' (also containing the S. element ''gaer'' \"dread\")<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, ''gaer''</ref> and '''''Yssion'''''.<ref name=\"WJ\" />\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn older versions of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' as well as the ''[[Annals of Aman]]'', Ossë and his spouse [[Uinen]] were Valar in their own right, and often opposed the will of Ulmo.\n\nIn [[Eriol]]'s [[Old English]] translations, Ossë is referred to as ''Saefrea'' (\"Sea-ruler\"),<ref>{{SM|QA1}}</ref> reflecting his status as a Vala (Fréa).\n\nIn that conception, Ossë is the source of the name ''Balar'' in place-names such as [[Cape Balar]], [[Isle of Balar]] and [[Bay of Balar]], which he often visited, and from which all [[Beleriand]] was named.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry BAL</ref><ref>{{GA|2}}</ref>\n\nOssë had a large house in [[Valmar]] made by [[Ónen]] and [[Oarni]] from pearls with a flour from sea water and roof from foam. He lived there during congregations of Valar or when the noise of the sea tired him.<ref>{{LT1|III}}</ref> In ''[[The Tale of the Sun and Moon]]'', it was mentioned that Ossë had green hair and his beard was torn.<ref>{{LT1|VIII}}</ref>\n\n''Ossë'' was also the name of a [[Tengwa]] similar to Roman c, which apparently had the value ''o''.<ref>{{VT|45}} p.15</ref> However elsewhere, this letter is named ''[[Elwë]]'' and has the value of ''e''. In the [[Mode of Beleriand]] this letter instead has the value ''a''.\n\nHis name ''Falman'' from the root FALA (e.g. ''falma'' \"foam\") appears in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]''.<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry \"Falman\"</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n{{ainur}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Osse}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Maiar]]\n[[Category:Qenya names]]\n[[Category:Quenya names]]\n[[Category:Second Age characters]]\n[[Category:Servants of Melkor]]\n[[de:Osse]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/ainur/maiar/osse]]\n[[fi:Ossë]]"}}}
