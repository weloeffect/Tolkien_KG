The Trout Bend was invented for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'' by [[Amazon Studios]].\n\n== Geography ==\nThe Trout Bend was named for the bend in a illegibly named river (--OG) that originated just at the eastern end of the river valley.\n\n== History ==\nIn the late [[Second Age]], the Trout Bend was a location that a certain [[Harfoots|Harfoot community]] passed by when migrating from one seasonal haven to the next, particularly from the [[Norfield Glen]] to the [[Grove]].\n\nDuring one such migration, the Brandyfoot family, [[Poppy Proudfellow]], and [[The Stranger]] crossed above a waterfall following after the main caravan of the Harfoot community which was far ahead of them.\n\nLater, a group of three [[Mystics]] possibly passed through the Trout Bend when they were stalking the Harfoot migration trail, seeking to find the Stranger.\n\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) locations]]"}}}
