The offspring of such marriages were known as [[Half-elven]].\n\nThere were three '''unions of the Eldar and the Edain''': [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]], and [[Tuor]] and [[Idril]], in the [[First Age]]; and [[Aragorn]] and [[Arwen]] in the [[Third Age]].<ref>{{App|A1i}}, p. 1034</ref>\n\nAdditionally, according to a local legend, [[Imrazôr]], the [[Princes of Dol Amroth|Prince of Belfalas]], married the Elf-maiden [[Mithrellas]], who gave birth to [[Galador|a son]] and [[Gilmith|a daughter]] before disappearing.<ref>{{UT|Amroth}}, p. 248</ref>\n\n==Similar cases==\n[[Finduilas]], a Noldorin princess of [[Nargothrond]], fell in love with [[Túrin]], but he rejected her advances.<ref>[[J.R.R.

Andreth, a [[Wise-woman]] of the [[Edain]], and [[Aegnor]], Finrod's brother, had fallen in love during the [[Siege of Angband]]. However, Aegnor turned away, though neither took another partner for the rest of their lives.<ref name=\":0\">{{MR|P4c}}, pp. 323-4</ref> \n\nFinrod explained to Andreth that the Eldar do not wed during times of war, and that Aegnor knew that the [[Dagor Bragollach|Siege of Angband would break]] soon. Additionally, while Andreth would grow old and die, Aegnor would carry the memories of Andreth until the [[Dagor Dagorath|end of Arda]], and he \"''would rather have a memory that is fair but unfinished than one that goes on to a grievous end.''\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nAs [[Christopher Tolkien]] explains, it seems that in the earliest version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', the union of a man and an elf was not of much significance, as in the tale of ''[[Turambar and the Foalókë]]'', the man [[Bethos]] is married to a [[Gnomes|Noldo]]-maiden, and they both have several children. However, in the same phase of these narratives, soon later [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] specified that Eärendel was the only being that is half of both kindreds, and that Tuor and Idril were the first wed between them.<ref>{{LT2|IIn}}, p. 130</ref> It should be noted though that the own narrative says that Bethos' wife was a Noldo \"as the tale telleth\",<ref>{{LT2|II}}, p. 101</ref> distancing this fact in a similar way to the case of Imrazôr and Mithrellas.\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Concepts]]"}}}
