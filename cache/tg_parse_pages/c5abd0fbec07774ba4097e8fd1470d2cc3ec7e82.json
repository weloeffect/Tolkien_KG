Dúrnost was invented by [[Amazon Studios]] for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]''.\n\n== History ==\nAfter the [[First Age]] and the [[War of Wrath]], [[Sauron]] took up residency at the fortress of Dúrnost deep within the region of [[Northern Waste|Forodwaith]], far to the north of [[Middle-earth]]. He sought to create a power over flesh derived from the [[Unseen]] world. As such, Sauron issued forth a call and many of [[Morgoth|Morgoth's]] former servants answered. Among whom, [[Adar (The Rings of Power)|Adar]] was one of them.\n\nDuring this time at Dúrnost, Sauron conducted experiments on many of the [[Orcs]] in order to tap into the [[Unseen]] world. Unfortunately, Adar eventually became became disillusioned with the Dark Lord's frequent sacrifices of the Orcs to create a power over flesh. As a result, Adar rebelled against Sauron, attaining the belief that he split him open. Dúrnost became abandoned sometime after this, save only for at least one [[Snow-trolls|Hristorco]].\n\nDuring the late [[Second Age]], [[Galadriel]] lead a company of [[Elves]] to investigate Dúrnost deep within Forodwaith, the last location marked on her map where Sauron could possibly be hiding.<ref group=\"note\">The map that Galadriel possesses has two sets of runes. One of which translates to Dúrnost. Dúrnost is also mentioned within the behind the scenes video for episode three.</ref> It was only when the company gave up hope and [[Thondir]] confronted her to get her to leave, that Dúrnost was revealed in a lightning storm.\n\nWhile investigating the inside of Dúrnost, Galadriel comes upon a filled in door leading to an anvil bearing the same sigil as the one that Sauron had engraved onto [[Finrod]], proving without a doubt that Sauron certainly once operated within Dúrnost long ago. Unfortunately, the investigation was cut short when the company was ambushed by a Hristorco that was stalking them within Dúrnost. After the slaying of the Hristorco, Galadriel attempts to resume her expedition further north. However, the other elves, led by Thondir, laid their swords down, refusing to go any further north and Galadriel was forced to return to the [[Gil-galad|High King Gil-Galad]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Dúrnost'' is clearly meant to be [[Sindarin]], a combination of ''[[dûr|dúr]]'' (\"dark, sombre\") + ''[[ost]]'' (\"fort, fortress, citadel\").\n\n{{References|Notes}}\n\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) locations]]"}}}
