Valandil was invented for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'' by [[Amazon Studios]]. He appeared in both the first and second seasons of the series and is portrayed by [[Alex Tarrant]].<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9788618/fullcredits|articlename=Full Cast & Crew|dated=|website=IMDb|accessed=28 July 2022}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Rings of Power Valandil and Isildur and Ontamo.jpg|left|thumb|302x302px|Valandil pictured with Isildur and Ontamo]]\nValandil was a close friend of fellow Númenoreans [[Isildur]] and [[Ontamo]], whom he joined in training to become part of the Númenorean [[Guild of Venturers|Sea-Guard]]. Isildur abandoned this endeavor by deliberately failing a task on a cadet training ship so that he could instead pursue the mysterious call of the Númenor's western shores like his brother [[Anárion]].\n\nAs a result of Isildur's mistake, the Sail Master in charge of their training dismissed not only Isildur, but Valandil and Ontamo as well. After their discharge, Valandil ended his friendship with Isildur and delivered a parting verbal blow to Isildur about how he would always \"brood and blubber about [his] dead mother\".\n\nAfter [[Nimloth (tree)|Nimloth]] began to shed its pedals, [[Tar-Míriel|Queen Regent Míriel]] announced the formation of an expeditionary force to the [[Southlands]] of [[Middle-earth]] to aid the [[Pre-Númenóreans|Southlanders]] against [[Adar (The Rings of Power)|Adar]] and install [[Halbrand]] as their king. Valandil joined the expedition along with Ontamo and Isildur, the latter of whom he had yet to forgive. While training under Isildur's father [[Elendil]], Valandil sparred with [[Galadriel]] and, upon scoring a hit on her during their duel, he was promoted to lieutenant.\n\nValandil forgave Isildur and they both set sail with the expedition. They later arrived in Middle-earth and defeated Adar's [[Orcs]] in [[Tirharad]]. Soon after their victory, [[Mount Doom|Orodruin]] erupted, resulting Tirharad's ruin. Valandil and Isildur assisted in the rescue efforts and, after saving Miriel, Isildur appeared to be crushed in burning rubble.\nBelieving Isildur to be dead, Valandil spoke with Elendil and told him of his son's supposed passing. While escorting Míriel back to the Númenórean camp, the two learned that she had been blinded by the ashes of Orodruin's eruption. The survivors of the expedition then traveled back to Númenor, where Valandil would eventually be reappointed to the Sea-Guard.\n[[File:The Rings of Power (TV series) - Valandil Duels Kemen.png|left|thumb|329x329px|Valandil during his duel with Kemen]]\nAfter Míriel's usurpal by [[Ar-Pharazôn]], Valandil was made to resign from the Sea Guard due to remaining faithful to the [[Valar]]. He later attended a memorial ceremony in the [[Old Quarter]] among the [[Faithful]] for those who had died in Miriel's military expedition. The memorial was then set upon by Ar-Pharazôn's son [[Kemen (The Rings of Power)|Kemen]] and a squad of [[King's Men]]. Valandil engaged in a duel with Kemen and had the upper hand but, at the urging of Elendil, refrained from killing him. Valandil then turned his back on Kemen and began to walk away, but Kemen stabbed him in the back as he did so, ending his life.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Valandil'' is a [[Quenya]] name. It means \"Lover of the Valar\"<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Carl F. Hostetter]] (ed.), ''[[The Nature of Middle-earth]]'', \"Part One. Time and Ageing: IV. Time-scales\", footnote 2</ref>. It is a compound of [[Valar|vala]] (\"Vala\") and [[-ndil|-(n)dil]] (\"lover\", \"friend\").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-772048115.html|articlename=Q.
