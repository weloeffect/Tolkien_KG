Tolkien's signature and monogram''' are synonymous with Tolkien's works, and have a history of their own. Both are registered trademarks owned by the [[Tolkien Estate]].\n\n==Signature history==\nTolkien's signature evolved over time. As early as [[1910]], he is recorded as having signed his name as \"Ronald Tolkien\" on an art piece titled ''[[Ruins at West End of White Abbey]]''.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator]]'', \"Early Work\", Image 10 </ref> In [[1913]] he signed his name as the more familiar \"J.R.R. Tolkien\" on his painting entitled [[Foxglove Year|''Foxglove Year'']]<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator]]'', \"Early Work\", Image 17</ref>, which accompanied a poem he wrote by the same name. A further evolution of Tolkien's signature is visible from a [[1923]] signing of a book he owned called ''The Latin Poems.''<ref>{{Cite web|articleurl=https://www.tolkienguide.com/modules/wiwimod/index.php?page=Bloomsbury+689|articlename=Bloomsbury Sale #689|author=Tolkien Collector's Guide|dated=16 July 2009|accessed=9 November 2024}}</ref>\n<gallery heights=\"60\">\nFile:J.R.R.

Tolkien]], ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator]]'', \"Early Work\", Image 8</ref> and included just a \"J\", an \"R\", and a \"T\". Another monogram appeared on a [[1911]] illustration titled [[Lamb's Farm, Gedling]]. The first use of the two-\"R\" motif (with one \"R\" being flipped) was in [[1912]] on a sheet containing two sketches, ''[[Keystone of Door]]'' and ''[[Gargoyles, South Side, Lambourn]]''<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator]]'', \"Early Work\", Image 13</ref>. [[1913]] saw the first use of the four dot design in a monogram on a piece titled ''[[Grownupishness]]''<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator]]'', \"Visions, Myths, and Legends\", Image 35</ref>. Another 1913 monogram contained the first instance of two uses of the four dots design on a piece titled ''[[Pagent House Gardens, Warwick]]''<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator]]'', \"Early Work\", Image 14</ref>. In [[1914]], a symmetrical monogram design appeared in the first text about [[Middle-earth]]'s genesis called ''[[Tanaqui]]'',<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator]]'', \"Visions, Myths, and Legends\", Image 43</ref> which depicted an early version of the mountain [[Taniquetil]]. In [[1918]], a monogram closely resembling the final monogram appeared on a piece entitled ''[[Gipsy Green]].''<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator]]'', \"Early Work\"</ref><gallery heights=\"120\">\nFile:J.R.R.

An asymmetrical variation showed up in the ink illustration titled ''Trolls. Another'' new symmetrical monogram showed up in one of Tolkien's illustrations titled ''[[The Hill: Hobbiton-across-the Water]]''<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist and Illustrator]]'', \"The Hobbit\", Image 98</ref>. A similar 1937 monogram appears on the dust jacket of the book. Another 1937 monogram appears on the illustration titled ''[[Conversation with Smaug]]'', and is highly reminiscent of Tolkien's \"modern\" monogram<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[J.R.R.

Tolkien exhibition of the same name. The exhibition was held by Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, in between 1976 and [[1977]]. Curiously, the monogram was horizontally inverted, which was likely a mistake of the printer who produced the catalogues.\n\nA correctly oriented version of the monogram later appeared on the spine of ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' in [[1980]]. However, this version omitted the two \"four-dots\" designs.\n\nThe two groups of four dots were added but were used inconsistently until [[1981]], when the final version of the monogram was designed and used on the cover of ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]''.<ref name=\":0\" /><gallery>\nFile:J.R.R. Tolkien Monogram 1976.png|The inverted 1976 Tolkien monogram from ''[[Drawings by Tolkien]]''.\nFile:J.R.R.
