According to a legend the King of the [[Galadhrim]] had met the oldest Ent [[Treebeard|Fangorn]] in ancient days.<ref name=\"Borders\">{{UT|6c}}</ref> As a consequence, it is possible that Fangorn Forest was named after the the Ent '''Fangorn'''. The forest was known as the '''Entwood''' in [[Rohan]].<ref>{{TT|Riders}}, p. 437</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Fangorn Forest.jpg|250px|thumb|''Fangorn Forest'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nFangorn Forest was located on the eastern side of the southern end of the [[Misty Mountains]], stretching for several hundred miles on all sides. The river [[Limlaith]] flowed through the forest from the northwest, while the wider [[Entwash]] flowed southward through the forest from the [[Misty Mountains]].<ref>{{FR|Map}}</ref> Birch, rowan, and pinewoods grew on the mountain slopes along the western edge of the forest. [[Peregrin Took]] described it as \"very dim, and stuffy\", comparing it to the [[Old Took|Old Took's]] room in the [[Great Smials]]. [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] contrasted the forest with [[Bilbo]]'s description of the pitch-dark [[Mirkwood]], saying, \"This is just dim, and frightfully tree-ish.\"<ref name=\"Treebeard\">{{TT|Treebeard}}</ref> [[Gimli]] said that \"the air is stuffy... lighter than [[Mirkwood]], but it is musty and shabby.\" [[Legolas]] described Fangorn as \"tense\" and \"old, very old...and full of memory\",<ref name=\"White\">{{TT|White}}</ref> Fangorn said the [[Elves]] woke up the trees and taught them to speak.<ref name=\"Treebeard\" /> Black crows, known as [[Crebain]], dwelt in the forest as native wildlife.<ref>{{FR|South}}</ref> In older times there was no visible border between Fangorn Forest and the wooded elven realm of [[Lórien]]. In those days Lórien extended beyond the river [[Celebrant]] to the south into open woodland that consisted of smaller trees, which merged into Fangorn Forest.<ref name=\"Borders\" /> At the time of {{TA|1981}} the borders of Fangorn Forest were still much closer to [[Lórien]].<ref>{{UT|Amroth}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nAmong the later inhabitants of middle earth during the [[Third Age]], Fangorn was notorious as a dangerous place, similar to [[Mirkwood]]. This idea was likely started by the fact that any person who wandered far into Fangorn or cut down trees would have been killed by Ents. Paired with the old and ominous feel of the forest, this most likely led people to believe that the forest was cursed, giving it its bad name. While still wary of the forest, earlier inhabitants of neighboring Rohan were less apt to label it evil, instead merely referring to the forest as the Entwood.\n\n===First and Second Ages===\nFangorn Forest was the easternmost survivor of the immense forest that spanned much of the [[Westlands]] in the [[Elder Days]], but which was destroyed by the [[Númenóreans]] and [[Sauron]] during the [[Second Age]]. Before the deforestation of these regions by Númenórean shipbuilders, Fangorn Forest was much larger, and may have been connected to the [[Old Forest]].<ref>{{UT|6d}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the Second Age, all of the [[Entwives]] had moved away from Fangorn, passing East over the [[Anduin]] never to return, although rumours have been told that the [[Entwives]] moved to the [[Old Forest]] near the [[Shire]]. According to [[Treebeard]], there have been no [[Entings]] in a long time after they were lost.\n\n===Third Age===\n[[File:Manuel Castañón - Hew the Entwood.jpg|thumb|\"Hew the Entwood\" by [[Manuel Castañón]]]]\n[[Saruman]] often used to walk in Fangorn and talk with [[Treebeard]], if he met him, and was always eager to listen to anything the old Ent told him about the forest. However, he never repaid Treebeard in the same way.<ref name=\"Treebeard\" /> Saruman used this knowledge of the forest's secrets for his own advantage.\n\nBeginning in {{TA|2953}} Saruman started fortifying [[Isengard]];<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> eventually his [[Orcs]] started abusing and harassing the forest, its trees and Ents, for his fortifications and war machines.\n\n====War of the Ring====\n[[File:Alan Lee - The White Rider.jpg|200px|thumb|Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas searching in the forest, art by [[Alan Lee]]]]\nOn [[28 February]] of {{TA|3019}},<ref name=\"Great\">{{App|Great}}</ref> [[Éomer]]'s [[Éored]] attacked and slaughtered the band of [[Uruk-hai]] of [[Uglúk]] under the eaves of Fangorn. This allowed Merry and Pippin to escape the Orcs and pass into the forest.<ref>{{TT|Uruk}}</ref> There they met [[Treebeard]] and informed him of the danger that Saruman posed to the Ents and their forest. Following the [[Entmoot]] the rest of the Ents finally agreed to march against Isengard, taking Merry and Pippin with them. Treebeard was angered by Saruman's Orcs chopping down parts of the forest. This was one of the reasons the Ents decided to attack Isengard.<ref name=\"Treebeard\" />\n\nOn [[1 March]] {{TA|3019}},<ref name=\"Great\" /> [[Aragorn]], Gimli and Legolas entered the forest in search of Merry and Pippin. Rather than the two young hobbits, they encountered the White Wizard. At first they believed him to be Saruman before realizing that it was [[Gandalf]], returned from death. His name was now [[Gandalf the White]].<ref name=\"White\" />\n\nOn [[3 March]] {{TA|3019}},<ref name=\"Great\" /> [[Gandalf]] talked with Treebeard at [[Isengard]] and [[Huorns]] were sent to [[Helm's Deep]] to help the [[Rohirrim]] in the battle.<ref>{{TT|Flotsam}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Fangorn'' is a [[Sindarin]] name, which literally means \"beard-(of)-tree\"<ref name=\"Other\">{{App|Other}}, p. 1131</ref><ref name=\"PE17\">{{PE|17}}, entry S '''fang-orn''', p. 84</ref> or more loosely \"[[Treebeard]]\".<ref>{{TT|Treebeard}}, p. 464</ref> It is a combination of the elements ''[[fang]]'' (\"beard\") and ''[[orn]]'' (\"(tall) tree\").<ref name=\"PE17\" />\n\n==Other names==\n''Entwood'' is a modernization of [[Old English]] ''Entwudu'' (''wudu'', \"wood\"), so modernized because it was recognizable by speakers of [[Westron]]. [[Gondorians]] used that name, assimilated to their own language.<ref name=\"Nomen\">{{HM|N}}, entry '''Entwade, Entwash, Entwood''', pp. 769-70</ref>\n\nIn his song ''[[In the Willow-meads of Tasarinan]]'',<ref name=\"Treebeard\" /> Treebeard mentions three ancient names in [[Quenya]]:\n*'''''Ambaróna''''', \"Eastern (Land)\", being the adjectival form of ''ambarónë'' (\"dawn\"),<ref>{{PE|17}}, entry Q '''Ambaróna''', p. 82</ref> which contains the elements ''[[amba]]'' (\"uprising\", \"sunrise\", \"orient\") and ''(h)róna'' (\"eastern\", \"east\").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, entry ''Ambarona'', pp. 384-5</ref>\n*'''''Tauremorna''''', \"Black Forest\", from ''[[taurë]]'' (\"forest\") and ''[[morna]]'' (\"black\", \"dark\").<ref>{{HM|UI}}, entry ''Tauremorna'', p. 385</ref> Treebeard also mentions the longer form ''Tauremornalómë''.\n*'''''Aldalómë''''', \"Tree-twilight\", from ''[[alda]]'' (\"tree\") and ''[[lómë]]'' (\"night\", \"twilight\").<ref>{{HM|UI}}, entry ''Aldalome'',  p. 385</ref>\n\n== Portrayal in adaptations ==\n'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Fangorn Forest is realized in the game not as a single region, but as a series of consecutive areas in five different game regions. From north-east to south-west they are: Limlight Gorge south of the river [[Limlight]] in the \"[[Anduin|Great River]]\" region, Balewood in the \"Wildermore\" region, Eaves of Fangorn in the \"[[Eastemnet|East Rohan]]\" region, Entwood in the \"[[Westemnet|West Rohan]]\" region, and Fangorn's Edge in [[Nan Curunír]] (which is part of the [[Dunland]] region). Some of these areas are connected to one another but feature significant jumps in the level range of the enemies. When following the natural progression of the main story, the player will end up visiting each of these areas at different times and not in the order described.\n\n{{References}}\n\n{{FellowshipRoute}}\n\n[[Category:Entish realms]]\n[[Category:Forests]]\n\n[[de:Fangorn]]\n[[fi:Fangornin metsä]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/forets/fangorn]]\n[[ru:Фангорн]]"}}}
