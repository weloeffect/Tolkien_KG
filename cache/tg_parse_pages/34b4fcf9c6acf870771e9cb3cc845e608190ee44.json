''Cirth'' (singular [[certh]]) means \"''runes''\" in [[Sindarin]].  ''[[Certhas]]'' refers to a runic alphabet. The system was an ancient writing of the [[Elves]], and although they were later largely replaced by the [[Tengwar]] (which were enhanced and brought by [[Fëanor]]), they were adopted by [[Dwarves]] because its straight lines were better suited to carving than the curved strokes of the Tengwar.\n\n==Cirth Table (Certhas Daeron shown)==\n{| border=\"1\"\n|<em style=\"font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;\">1</em>\n|p\n|<em style=\"font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;\">8</em>\n|t\n|<em style=\"font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;\">e</em>\n|c\n|<em style=\"font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;\">R</em>\n|r\n|<em style=\"font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;\">l</em>\n|i\n|-\n|<em style=\"font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;\">2</em>\n|b\n|<em style=\"font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;\">9</em>\n|d\n|<em style=\"font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;\">r</em>\n|g\n|<em style=\"font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;\">a</em>\n|l\n|<em style=\"font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;\">S</em>\n|u (/w?)\n|-\n|<em style=\"font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;\">5</em><ref>The original value of this certh wasn&rsquo;t given by Tolkien, but he mentions that in later Angerthas, it took the value ''hw'' after <em style=\"font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;\">6</em> became ''m'' (for reasons explained below) while he doesn't give us the early certh for M.

The cirth runes themselves existed beforehand, with different but unglossed values. \n\nThe known ancient cirth don’t cover all the sounds of Sindarin, since we are missing ''rh'', ''lh'', ''mh'', ''v'', ''y'', ''œ''. Perhaps they were used for the [[Old Sindarin]] tongue, and many of the above mentioned sounds indeed didn’t exist in that language. However still frequent sounds ''w'' and ''a'' are missing. This indicates that some ancient, unknown cirth could have existed, but didn’t make it to the later systems; a fuller table therefore can't be reconstructed.\n\nAs for the vowel usage, perhaps the certh for ''u'' possibly was used for ''w'' (like in early latin orthography). The certh for ''a'' can’t be guessed, so maybe this sound was “meant” (like in some Quenya Tengwar Modes). More possibly it was one of the two cirth whose value can’t be determined, or it was one of some other cirth that did not survive till the later Angerthas.\n\nLong vowels were evidently indicated by doubling (cf. the known certh for long ''o'', <em style=\"font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;\">n</em>, is a simplified form of <em style=\"font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;\">bb</em>).\n\n==History==\nDuring the [[Chaining of Melkor]], the [[Sindar]] of [[Beleriand]] began developing an alphabet for their language. Its letters were entirely made for carving on wood, stone or metal, hence their angular forms and straight lines. These letters were named ''cirth'' (sing. ''certh'').\n\nThe assignment of values was unsystematic. The form of a certh was consisted of a stem and a branch. The branch was found usually on the right side of the stem, and sometimes on the left, but with no phonetic significance. Therefore <em style=\"font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;\">3</em> would just be an alternative form of <em style=\"font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;\">1</em>.\n\nCerthas Daeron was created in the [[Year of the Trees 1300]] of the [[First Age]] by [[Daeron]],<ref>{{AA|85|note}}</ref> the minstrel of king [[Thingol]] of [[Doriath]], and was later expanded into what was known as the [[Angerthas Daeron]]. \n\nBy the [[Second Age]] the cirth were seldomly used. The [[Noldor]] of [[Eregion]] used cirth as a \"matter of lore\" mainly for formal writing. It was how the [[Dwarves of Moria]] got to know them and preferred them from the tengwar, being intended for carved inscriptions.<ref group=\"note\">The text connects the lore usage of the cirth by the [[Gwaith-i-Mirdain]] with the notion that [[Celebrimbor]] was a descendant of Daeron, a late conception (1968 or later) which Christopher Tolkien nonetheless did not retain in ''The Silmarillion'', because it would have contradicted the mention of Celebrimbor's descent from Fëanor in the second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings''.</ref> They modifed the system accordngly for their Khuzdul language (cf. ''[[Angerthas Moria]]'' and ''[[Angerthas Erebor]]'').\n\nBy the [[Third Age]] only some Elves of [[Sindar]]in descent wrote in cirth in inscriptions, even though with spelling influence from the [[tengwar]]. The [[Longbeards]] were of the very few peoples who still knew and used cirth, leading to the misconception that they invented them, and were known as \"dwarf-letters\" by outsiders.<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nMany letters have shapes also found in the historical [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_Futhark Futhark], but their sound values are only similar in a few of the vowels. Rather, the system of assignment of sound values is much more systematic in the Cirth than in the historical runes (e.g., voiced variants of a voiceless sound are expressed by an additional stroke). A similar system has been proposed for a few historical runes (e.g. ''p'' ᛈ  and ''w'' ᚹ as variants of ''b'' ᛒ), but is in any case much more obscure.\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nTolkien had noted an apparent discrepancy between [[Elrond]]'s reference to the Runes (the [[Moon-letters]]) as invented by the Dwarves, and [[Appendix E]] stating that they were invented by the [[Sindar]] in [[Beleriand]]. He attempted to resolve the discrepancy by having the Dwarves invent the Runes, and Daeron organising them; or making [[Angerthas Moria]] a purely Dwarvish invention. However, he decided that Elrond referred only to the Moon-letters and not the alphabetic system itself. [[Christopher Tolkien]] cites this incident as an example of how he strived for consistency for his [[Secondary world]].<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #8</ref>\n\n==Encoding==\nThe Cirth are not part of the Unicode Standard. However the ConScript Unicode Registry has defined the U+E080&ndash;E0FF range of the Unicode \"Private Use Area\" for Cirth.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Tengwar]]\n*[[Sarati]]\n*[[Languages]]\n\n{{references|note}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.cirth.de Cirth.de - Explore the appearances of runes in Tolkien's work]\n*[http://ring-lord.tripod.com/cirth/index.htm Dan Smith's Cirth article] Information and font to download\n*[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/History_of_Elven_writing_systems History of Elven writing systems]\n*[http://std.dkuug.dk/jtc1/sc2/wg2/docs/n1642/n1642.htm Official proposal to encode Cirth in Unicode]\n*[http://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/cirth.html Cirth proposal for ConScript Unicode Registry]\n{{languages}}\n[[Category:Writing systems]]\n\n[[de:Cirth]]\n[[fi:Cirth]]\n[[fr:encyclo/langues/cirth]]"}}}
