Since January I have been under medical care, with strict orders as to diet, and hours of work — which I have to confine to one object: the attempt to complete at least a part of my unfinished works while I have the health and energy left.<br/><br/>Forgive the delay in this reply. I have been away from Oxford, to which I return next week.<br/><br/>Yours sincerely<br/>J.R.R. Tolkien}}\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Letters|Higgins, John]]"}}}
