The manuscripts used in the book are held by Chris Tolkien, grandson of Hilary.\n\nAlso included are unpublished photographs of the Tolkien family, and excerpts from an [[Letters not published in The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien|unpublished letter]] from [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] to Hilary (see [[Letter to Hilary Tolkien]]).\n\n==From the publisher==\n\nRecently discovered tales written by Hilary in a little exercise book when\nhe was an old man of his growing up with his brother as a young boy and\nthe turbulent horrors of war and happy times since. Includes unpublished\nphotographs, letters and wonderful illustrations that capture a time and a\nplace that has long gone, yet shows Middle-England as several\ngenerations knew it.\n\n== Reviews ==\n\n\"It is evident that the brothers were extraordinarily close; their shared experiences as children, encouraged by the wilder, more physically adventurous Hilary, gave Ronald the grounding in nature that anchored his fantasy to the earth. Reading these almost whimsical fragments is like scanning a rudimentary blueprint for The Lord Of The Rings and The Hobbit. [...] As a collection of tales for children, it has immense charm. But for Tolkien fans, it offers a hitherto undisclosed insight into the origins of his monumental works of fantasy.\"<ref>Neil Norman, \"Simple tales reveal Tolkien's inspiriation\", Daily Mail (27 February 2009, p. 62)</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*''[[Wheelbarrows at Dawn|Wheelbarrows at Dawn: Memories of Hilary Tolkien]]''\n\n==External links==\n\n*[http://johngarth.wordpress.com/2014/02/17/the-tolkien-brothers-in-bumble-dell/ The Tolkien brothers in Bumble Dell] by [[John Garth]]\n*[http://www.tolkienguide.com/modules/wiwimod/index.php?page=Black+and+White+Ogre+Country+Review Review] by [[Jason Fisher]]\n{{references}}\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Books with contribution by J.R.R.
