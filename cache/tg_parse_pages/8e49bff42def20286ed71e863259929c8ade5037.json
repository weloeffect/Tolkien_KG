Therefore, the past and future physical developments were already determined and beyond the power of any, even the [[Valar]], to alter in any large and permanent way.<ref name=fate /> This inability to \"change\" was distinct from \"redirection\", which any rational being could do in small ways such as moving, redirecting, or even destroying objects in the world.<ref name=fate /> The fixed, unalterable conditions of the world (which did not include the rational creatures in it) was also known as ''ambarmenië'' (\"the way of the world\").<ref name=fate />\n\nRegarding individuals, included in umbar is also the network of, mostly physical, \"chances\" which were presented to rational persons that, through their free will, they might or might not use.<ref name=fate /> Examples of such chances were the meeting between [[Thorin]] and [[Gandalf]] which instigated the [[Quest for Erebor]], and the finding of the [[One Ring]] by [[Bilbo]]; in such chances, individuals were not compelled to an action, and thus the chance could fail to \"go off\".<ref name=fate />\n\nThe Eldar also did not believe these two aspects were separate, and the continual clash of \"chances\" within the world inevitably worked out towards Eru's Plan.<ref name=fate /> For example, Bilbo surrendered the Ring to [[Frodo]] by an act of free will, and Frodo was then \"fated\" to go [[Quest of the Ring|on his quest]] but not necessarily to destroy it; if the downfall of [[Sauron]] and destruction of the Ring was part of Eru's Plan, then even if Bilbo had refused to surrender it, other means would have appeared to bring this about. This can be seen where, when Frodo's will failed to destroy the Ring, [[Gollum]]'s intervention brought it about regardless.<ref name=fate />\n\nDirect or mediate interventions by Eru were considered to be \"miracles\" that were ''outside'' of umbar and altered the previous scheme for all remaining time. Such miracles included events like the [[Drowning of Númenor]].<ref name=fate />\n\n==Etymology==\nFrom the [[Primitive Quendian]] [[Sundocarme|root]] ''[[MBAR]]'' came the [[Common Eldarin]] ''*ṃbar’tă'' which originally meant \"permanent establishment/order\";<ref name=fate /> ''-tă'' being a transitive / causative suffix. \n\n''*Ṃbar’tă'' semantically shifted as the Eldar considered \"fate\" to be an immutable physical obstacle to will.<ref name=fate />\n\nIn the development of Quenya, the consonantal nasal before voiced stops in some instances became vocalic and syllabic. In such cases the consonant group was treated as a medial group. The syllabic nasal developed an actual vowel dependent on the quality of the following consonant. Before ''b'', ''gw'' the vowel was ''u''. Thus ''*ṃbar’tă'' > ''ṃbart-'' > ''umbart-'' > ''umbar'' (genitive ''umbarto'').<ref name=fate /> <ref>{{PE|OP2}}</ref>{{rp|77}}\n\n==Cognates==\n*[[Sindarin]] ''[[Úmarth]]''\n\n== Letter in Tengwar ==\n[[Image:Umbar.gif|right]]''Umbar'' is the name in Quenya of the sixth letter of the [[Tengwar]] alphabet.<ref name=\"Names\">{{App|Letters}}</ref> It is the second letter of the second grade or [[Tyellë]], which contains \"voiced stops\" and it is the second letter in the labial or ''p''-series of consonants, the ''[[Parmatéma]]''.<ref name=\"Letters\">{{App|Letters}}</ref>  In the standard spelling of Quenya ''Umbar'' represents '''MB'''.<ref>{{App|Letters}}, Note</ref>  In all other modes this letter represents '''B'''.<ref name=\"Letters\"/>  The Westron name for this letter is '''''Bí'''''.<ref>See ''[[Alphabet of Fëanor: Numenian, or Westron, Mode]]''</ref> \n\nIn [[Gondor]] the word [[lambe]] (\"tongue\") was substituted as the name of this letter since ''umbar'' had acquired a sinister use, like modern English \"doom\" which often has a meaning closer to \"curse\".<ref>{{PE|17}}</ref>{{rp|104}}\n\n== Other versions ==\nIn [[Qenya]], the word for fate was ''amarto'' or ''ambar(rt)'',<ref>{{PE|12}}</ref>{{rp|34}} with the [[Gnomish]] cognates ''umrod'' or ''umbart''.<ref>{{PE|11}}</ref>{{rp|75}}\n\nIn a revision, ''umbar'' (''umbarten'') still had the meaning of \"fate, doom\", but was derived from the [[Sundocarme|root]] ''[[MBARAT|MBARAT-]]''.
