It is a frigid but geologically active area with sulphur deposits and geysers, and a river running eastward through the middle. In the north-west is the Anvil of Winterstith, a glacier that houses the Frost-horde, an army of dragon-spawn led by Hrímil Frost-Heart, a great Cold-[[dragon]] of the ancient days. A servant of [[Morgoth]] during the First Age, Hrímil rejected Sauron and earned his enmity by consuming one of the Dwarven [[Rings of Power]].\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Regions]]\n[[Category:Rhovanion]]\n[[Category:Valleys]]\n[[de:Dürre Heide]]\n[[fr:encyclo:geographie:reliefs:rhovanion:brande dessechee]]\n[[fi:Kulottunut Nummi]]"}}}
