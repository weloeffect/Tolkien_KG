She was described as being the most beautiful mortal woman of her time - tall, dark-haired, bright-eyed, and extremely majestic. She also had a stern and cold disposition. Her son Túrin, but not her daughters, inherited her beauty and her tendency to keep her emotions and thoughts to herself. She was called ''Eledhwen'', the elven-fair, by [[Men]], because of the light of her glance and the beauty of her face.<ref name=UT2>{{UT|2}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nMorwen was the daughter of [[Baragund]], [[Lord of Ladros]], and so belonged to the [[House of Beor]]. In the immediate aftermath of the [[Dagor Bragollach]], Morwen, together with her first cousin [[Rían]], fled [[Ladros]] with the help of their kinswoman [[Emeldir]], first to [[Brethil]] and eventually to [[Dor-lómin]]. There, she eventually married [[Húrin]] of the [[House of Hador]] and [[Lord of Dor-lómin]]. They had three children together, [[Túrin]], [[Urwen]], and [[Nienor]]. Urwen perished to the [[Evil Breath]], a plague of Morgoth, when she was a young child.\n\nAfter Húrin's departure to fight for [[Fingon]] at the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], Morwen, who was pregnant with their third child, remained in her husband's house as the Lady of [[Dor-Lómin]]. After Morgoth's victory at the Nirnaeth, hordes of [[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterlings]] who had betrayed the [[Edain]], [[Incomers|invaded]] [[Hithlum]]. Even though they took control of the land, they left Morwen and her household alone for a while, as her incredible beauty led them to believe her to be a witch with dealings with the Elves. She was indeed in contact with small groups of Elves living in the mountains close to her house, but from them she received only information, and that very scant.\n\nEventually she thought it best to send her only surviving child, Túrin, to [[Doriath]] with [[Gethron]] and [[Grithnir]] to seek refuge. Being pregnant, and out of fear of drawing the Easterlings' attention, Morwen herself remained in Dor-Lómin.\n\nTúrin was adopted by King [[Thingol]], who sent messengers back to [[Hithlum]] bringing her news about Túrin's well-being, invitations from Thingol and gifts from [[Melian]]. But she refused to leave her home, not the least because her daughter [[Nienor]] was still a baby.<ref name=UT2/> In her stead she sent to Túrin the dragon-crested [[Helm of Hador]], the heirloom of their house.<ref>{{CH|4}}</ref>\n\nMorwen's house was oppressed by [[Brodda]]'s Easterlings, although she received the help of [[Aerin]], a kinswoman of Húrin whom Brodda had taken to wife against her will, and who knew Morwen's counsel.<ref>{{CH|12}}</ref> Meanwhile, Túrin had exiled himself out of Doriath and made himself a hero. The fame of the [[Black Sword]] reached to Hithlum, saying that he was cleansing [[Beleriand]] from perils, without Morwen knowing that he was her own son. Nienor now had grown up, and Morwen eventually fled the tyranny of Hithlum through [[Ered Wethrin]] and came to Doriath, only to find out that her son had left.<ref>{{CH|10}}</ref> Túrin's travels also brought him to the north and liberated Dor-Lómin, but it was too late, as Morwen and Nienor had long gone. \n\n[[Elves of Nargothrond]] came to Doriath, bringing news about its [[Sack of Nargothrond|sack]] by [[Glaurung]] and that Túrin was under [[Orodreth]]'s service in [[Nargothrond]]; hearing this, against Melian's counsel Morwen left Doriath to seek news of him. [[Mablung]] and [[march-wardens]] were tasked to accompany her; unknown to both, [[Nienor]] had joined them. Mablung reached her near [[Sirion]] but Morwen refused to hear him; then Nienor revealed herself and both women tried to persuade each other to return.\n\nAs Morwen refused to go back, and Nienor wouldn't abandon her mother, Mablung perforce passed them over the [[Meres of Twilight]] and left the women with guards upon [[Amon Ethir]] before setting out with a small company to scout Nargothrond as were his orders by Thingol. Yet [[Glaurung]] left Nargothrond and Mablung was unable to prevent them both from getting ensnared in the traps of the [[Dragon]]. \n\nMorwen was then lost in the fog that arose from the Dragon's steamy breath and Mablung heard no news from her.<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Húrin Finds Morwen.jpg|left|thumb|''Húrin Finds Morwen'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nYears later, Morwen, now in her fifties, came to the [[Forest of Brethil]] and found the graves of her children at [[Cabed Naeramarth]]. Húrin found her there. She was dying, and asked her husband how their son found his sister; but Húrin never replied. They spent the evening together until she passed away at sunset. Húrin dug for her a grave above Cabed Naeramarth on the west side of the [[Stone of the Hapless]] cutting the words ''Here lies also Morwen Eledhwen''.\n\nAccording to the words of [[Glirhuin]], the mound survived the [[War of Wrath]] and as [[Tol Morwen]] was the westernmost isle off the coast of [[Lindon]] in the [[Second Age|Second]] and [[Third Age]]s.<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Morwen'' is [[Sindarin]] for \"Dark Maiden\", from ''[[môr]]'' (\"darkness, dark, night\") + ''[[gwenn]]'' (\"maiden\").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entries ''[[môr]]'', ''[[wen]]''</ref>\n\n==Other names==\nHer epithet, '''''Eledhwen''''', means \"Elfsheen\"<ref>{{S|18}}</ref> or \"Elven-fair\"<ref>{{L|211}}, p. 281</ref>.
