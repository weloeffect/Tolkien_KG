Gollum warns them it is a nasty place. He is visibly anxious as they make their way to the stairs of Cirith Ungol, mere metres away from the walkway leading to [[Minas Morgul|the city]], and urges them to hurry. Upon seeing the scale of the climb ahead of them, Frodo and Sam are daunted. As Sam and Gollum begin to climb, Frodo begins to stagger towards the city, as though forced to against his own will. Gollum and Sam wrench him back from the bridge, and as they do so, a great rumbling occurs and a pillar of blue flame rises quickly from the city into the sky. This is seen by [[Gondorian]] soldiers in [[Minas Tirith]], and by [[Gandalf]] and [[Pippin]]; the wizard comforts the scared young hobbit.\n\nFrodo, Sam and Gollum hide at the base of the stairs. They see the [[Witch-king]] emerge from the city, atop a [[fell beast]]. The two hobbits feel pain at the piercing scream of the Nazgûl, with Frodo recalling [[A Knife in the Dark (scene)|the attack of the Witch-king's blade]] on [[Weathertop]]. A great host of Orcs emerge from the city and cross the bridge, passing the hiding place of Frodo and Sam. The Witch-king leaves the city with his army and Frodo and Sam begin their ascent.\n\nGandalf looks on concernedly. He understands that the \"great battle\" has begun. \n{{blockquote| The board is set, the pieces are moving.|[[Gandalf]]}}\n\n==Differences==\nThis scene shows that the stairs of Cirith Ungol are much closer in proximity to Minas Morgul than they are in the book. The distance between the stairs and Minas Morgul is described in the chapter [[The Stairs of Cirith Ungol]]. It is said that Frodo, Sam, and Gollum \"came slowly to the white bridge. Here the road, gleaming faintly, passed over the stream in the midst of the valley, and went on, winding deviously up towards the city's gate: a black mouth opening in the outer circle of the northward walls.\"<ref name=\"TT Stairs\">{{TT|Stairs}}</ref>{{rp|704}}\n\nIn the book, the Witch-king halted and turned his head side to side as though searching for something. The text mentions that \"he was troubled, sensing some other power within his valley,\" and that Frodo felt an urgent command to put on [[the Ring]] as he was doing so.<ref name=\"TT Stairs\"/>{{rp|706}} While the Witch-king does briefly look around during his entrance in this scene, the book describes his actions and thoughts in finer detail in this instance. \n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King scenes|15]]"}}}
