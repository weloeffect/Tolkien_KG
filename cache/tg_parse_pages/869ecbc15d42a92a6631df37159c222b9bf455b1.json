It was enclosed by a wall of encircling mountains, east of [[Palisor]], described as \"hallowed\" and full of sweet fragrances and odours, and songs of [[nightingales]], its beauty being comparable to [[Valinor]]. It was full of sleeping figures.\n\nIt was discovered by the [[Dark Elves|Dark Elf]] [[Nuin]] after finding a passage through the mountain wall. Nuin almost swooned at its loveliness and was puzzled by the Sleepers. Despite [[Tû (king of the Hisildi)|Tû]]'s warnings, Nuin visited it often to watch the Sleepers until, overcome with curiosity, he woke the first pair of them.<ref>{{LT1|X}}</ref>\n\n''Murmenalda'' is [[Qenya]], composed of ''murme'' \"sleep\" ([[root]] MURU) and ''nalda'' (root NLDL).<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}</ref>\n\nIn the \"[[Myths Transformed]]\" section of ''[[Morgoth's Ring]]'', the awakening of Men is proposed to be much earlier, sometime between the [[Awakening of the Elves]] and the [[Battle of the Powers]] ({{YT|1050}} - {{YT|1100}}).<ref>{{MR|Myths}}</ref> In ''[[The Nature of Middle-earth]]'', the date is given as {{YT|1075}} (which is of course by no means final desision).<ref>{{NM|Awaking}}, p. 43</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cuiviénen]]\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hildorien}}\n[[Category:Eastern lands]]\n[[Category:Quenya locations]]\n[[Category:Regions]]\n[[Category:Rhûn]]\n[[de:Hildórien]]\n[[fi:Hildórien]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/regions/hildorien]]"}}}
