The song plays at the end of the story, as [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], [[Gandalf]], [[Elrond]], among others, sail to the lands beyond the sea, bidding farewell to [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]].\n\n==Lyrics==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nRoads go ever, ever on\nTo the﻿ lands beyond the sea. \nOn a white ship will I sail,\nWatching shadows part for me.\n\nLeaving Havens grey with rain,\nNow that years have slipped away.\nLeaving friends with gentle pain\nAs they start another day.\n \nRoads I traveled I must leave,\nFor I've turned the final bend.\nWeep not empty tears, but grieve\nAs the road comes to an end.\n\nIt's so easy not to try; \nLet the world go drifting by.\nIf you never say hello,\nYou won't have to say goodbye.\n\nIf you never say hello,\nYou won't have to say goodbye!\n</poem>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:The Return of the King (1980 film) soundtrack]]"}}}
