He was half Welsh and half Anglo-Spanish.\n\nHe took care of [[Mabel Suffield|Mabel Tolkien]] during her illness, and took over custody of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Ronald]] and [[Hilary Tolkien]] after her death. Father Francis was a [[J.R.R. Tolkien's inspirations#pipe-smoking|pipe-smoker]] and Tolkien derived his own custom from this.\n\nFather Francis Xavier Morgan, forbade Tolkien to see [[Edith Tolkien|Edith Bratt]] until he was twenty-one because he saw her as a distraction from his studies. With one exception, Tolkien obeyed this instruction to the letter while Father Morgan's guardianship lasted. \n\nTolkien named his first son, [[John Tolkien|John Francis Reuel]] after him.<ref>{{B|III}}, p. 97</ref>\n\nIn 2013, [[José Manuel Ferrández Bru]] published ''[[La Conexion Española de J.R.R.

These names are clearly related with other words of the same lexicon: ''fair'' (\"free, unconstrained\"), ''faidwen/faith'' (\"liberty\"), ''faithir'' (\"liberator, Saviour\").<ref>{{PE|13}}, p. 33</ref> The translation is based on etymology as the name [[Wikipedia:Francis (given name)#Derivation|Francis]] (from Italian Francesco) derives from the [[Wikipedia:Franks#Etymology|Franks]], who in turn gave the word [[Wiktionary:frank|frank]] (\"free of servitude; candid, outspoken, unreserved\").<ref>[[Wikipedia:Name of the Franks#Name and etymology|Etymology of the name \"Franks\"]]</ref> Ferrández Bru considered that Tolkien honored Father Francis this way.\n\nFerrández Bru suggests that [[Thingol]] was partly inspired from Father Francis, considering his opposition to the courtship of [[Beren]] to [[Lúthien]]; with whom Tolkien identified himself and Edith.<ref>[[José Manuel Ferrández Bru]], ''\"[[La Conexion Española de J.R.R.
