The pillar, made from Cotswold stone, marks the centuries-old meeting place of four county shires: Gloucestershire, Warwickshire, Oxfordshire and Worcestershire.\n\nDue to local government reorganisation in the 1970s, the boundaries of these counties have now been moved and only three shires - no longer including Worcestershire, whose boundary is now further west - currently intercept here.\n\nIt is believed that this stone was an inspiration for [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien's]] [[Three-Farthing Stone]], a central point in [[the Shire]] where three [[Farthing]]s met.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.rootsweb.com/~engcots/4ShireStonePhotos.html Further photographs of the Four Shire Stone]\n\n[[Category:Structures (real-world)]]"}}}
