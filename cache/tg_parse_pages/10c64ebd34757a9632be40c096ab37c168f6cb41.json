He is voiced by [[Wally Wingert]].<ref>[http://www.wallyontheweb.com/home_new.html Wallyontheweb.com]</ref>\n\n==History==\nBalfor was a Dwarf of the [[Iron Hills]], captured by [[Goblins]]. He was set to work on the Dwarf-built contraptions in [[Goblin-town]]. [[Ugslap]] was his guard.\n\n[[Bilbo Baggins]] met him when he was lost in the [[Misty Mountains]]. After a deal with Ugslap to free Balfor went sour, Balfor was taken back to another cell. Bilbo dodged the guards and opened the cell, after which Balfor slew every goblin in the room. He then showed Bilbo a way out of Goblin-town. Bilbo, however, wound up in [[Gollum]]'s cave.<ref>[[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|''The Hobbit'' (2003 video game)]], \"Riddles in the Dark\"</ref>\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Dwarves from adaptations]]"}}}
