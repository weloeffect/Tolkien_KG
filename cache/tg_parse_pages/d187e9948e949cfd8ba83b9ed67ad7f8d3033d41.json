It is entitled ''The Tale of Years (Chronology of the Westlands)''.  It primarily contains timelines (lists of years) from the [[Second Age|Second]], [[Third Age|Third]], and [[Fourth Age|Fourth]] Ages and the events of those years.  There are also a few brief narrative sections, including a short discussion of the [[Wizards]] and how [[Gandalf]] received the [[Narya|Ring of Fire]] from [[Círdan]].<ref>{{App|B}}</ref>\n\n'''''The Tale of Years''''' was said to have been put together at the [[Great Smials]] (its library contained sources about [[Númenor]], histories and legends about [[Elendil]] and his descendants and other copies of [[Gondorians|Gondorian]] scribes) and with the assistance of material collected by [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]], who collected much information from [[Rivendell]]. Many of its dates are said to be conjectural but important, especially concerning the Second Age.<ref>{{FR|Records}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nAppendix B is divided into several sub-sections:\n\n;The Second Age\n:It covers the major events of the little-documented [[Second Age]], concerning [[Númenor]] and the [[Rings of Power]].\n;The Third Age\n:It covers the years [[Third Age 2|2]] - [[Third Age 3017|3017]] of the [[Third Age]], focusing mainly on events in [[Arnor]], [[Gondor]], and [[The Shire]].\n;The Great Years\n:It covers specific dates for particular events of the time period of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (the years [[Third Age 3018|3018]] and [[Third Age 3019|3019]]); it begins with [[Gandalf]]'s return to [[Hobbiton]] and concludes with the destruction of the Ring. This section also gives a brief account of the battles of the Northern campaign during the [[War of the Ring]] that are not mentioned in the main book.\n;The Chief Days from the Fall of Barad-dur to the End of the Third Age\n:It finishes the events of ''The Lord of the Rings'', giving specific dates up through [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]]'s return to [[Bag End]].\n;Later Events Concerning the Members of the Fellowship of the Ring\n:Chronology of the early [[Fourth Age]] (although dates are given in the [[Shire-reckoning]], and primarily follow what happened with the hobbits).  The last entry tells the final fate of [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], and [[Gimli]].\n{{references}}\n{{appendices}}\n[[Category:Annals]]\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings chapters]]\n[[fi:Liite B]]"}}}
