The [[Great Gates]] of Moria led directly into the First Hall, and from this space there was a wide passage and stairs leading to the [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm]], the [[Second Hall]], and the rest of the city.  In contrast to much of Khazad-dûm, the First Hall was brightly lit due to high windows on the eastern side.<ref>{{FR|II5}}</ref> \n\n==History==\n[[Balin's folk]] managed to claim the First Hall after driving out Orcs from the [[Great Gate]] and the guard room.
