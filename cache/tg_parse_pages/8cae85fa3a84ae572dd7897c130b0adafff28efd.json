The [[Noldoli]] sent an embassy to Manwë as well, speaking against Melko and his lies. Manwë chided both, sending Melko away to [[Halls of Mandos|Mandos]], and instructing Aulë to find a new place for the Noldoli to dwell, fearing that their discontent would spread among the others at Kôr. The happiness of the Noldoli was greatly diminished then, both as a result of Melko's treachery and of the loss of their home.<ref name=Theft>{{LT1|VI}}</ref>{{rp|141–2}}\n\nThe place the Noldoli chose to build their new home was situated alongside the small stream [[Híri]], which plunged underground north of the roots of [[Silpion]]. There was a rock-ringed dale there, where the Noldoli made caves in the walls and stored their precious gems and metals. They considered it their temporary home, always believing that they would one day return to Kôr.<ref name=Theft/>{{rp|142}}\n\nThey remained there until the great feast called [[Samírien]], which occurred every twenty-one years, was approaching. For the celebration, all of the Eldar fared to [[Valmar]], including those that dwelt at Sirnúmen.<ref name=Theft/>{{rp|143}} On the third day of that feast, Melko, knowing that Sirnúmen would be emptied, crept there with many of his dark accomplices. He was surprised to find that the Noldoli, grown wary, had left guards to protect their treasury despite the custom of the feast. Melko and his followers slew the guards, one of which was [[Bruithwir]], the father of [[Fëanor]], and plundered the gems kept there, including the [[Silmarils]] wrought by Fëanor.<ref name=Theft/>{{rp|144–5}}\n\nReturning to Sirnúmen, the Noldoli found their guards slain and were distraught, though Manwë told them that such a tragedy would not have befallen them if they had not broken tradition and left some of their number behind. When a messenger of Melko arrived at Valmar, riders were sent to Sirnúmen to summon the Elves that dwelt there, as the matter concerned them. Manwë sent a message to Melko banishing him from Valinor forever.<ref name=Theft/>{{rp|146–8}} Then [[Aulë]] spoke to Manwë on behalf of the Noldoli, and Manwë granted the Noldoli permission to return to Kôr if they wished. Many did so, but Fëanor and a few folk remained in Sirnúmen. There Fëanor brooded, and his discontent grew, until at last he went to Kôr, speaking against the Valar and urging the Noldoli to leave Valinor.<ref name=Theft/>{{rp|149–50}}\n\nLater, Melko and [[Gwerlum]], sneaking into Valinor with the intent of destroying the [[Two Trees]], were briefly hindered by [[Daurin]], one of the Noldoli from Sirnúmen. Melko slew Daurin and finished destroying the trees, while those that had witnessed Daurin's death fled to alert the Valar of what they had seen.<ref name=Theft/>{{rp|153}} Following the destruction of the Two Trees, Fëanor succeeded in persuading his people to arm themselves and [[Flight of the Noldor|leave Valinor]]. However, they left many of their youngest children in Kôr and Sirnúmen.<ref>{{LT1|VII}}, pp. 162-4</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Sirnúmen'' is [[Qenya]], apparently derived from root [[SIRI]] (\"flow\") + ''[[númë]]'' (\"West\").<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, pp. 263-5</ref> In his commentary, [[Christopher Tolkien]] translates it as 'Western Stream'.<ref name=VIn/>{{rp|157}} \n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn its first two occurrences in the text, the name was originally written ''Numessir'' and was changed to ''Sirnúmen''. In all later occurrences, ''Sirnúmen'' was the first form written.<ref name=VIn>{{LT1|VIn}}</ref>{{rp|155}} \n\nReferencing this same location, while composing the ''Lost Tales'', [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] wrote in a separate notebook that, \"The river of the second rocky dwelling of the Gnomes in Valinor was ''[[kelusindi]]'' and the spring at its source ''[[kapalinda]]''.\"<ref name=VIn/>{{rp|157}} \n\nChristopher Tolkien notes that Sirnúmen is the precursor of [[Formenos]],<ref name=VIn/>{{rp|158}} the location in the later [[legendarium]] where Fëanor and a number of his [[Noldor|people]] dwell when they are exiled from [[Tirion]],<ref>{{S|Unrest}}</ref> and where Fëanor's [[Finwë|father]] is slain by [[Melkor]] during the theft of the Silmarils.<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Formenos]]\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Locations in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Qenya locations]]\n[[Category:Valinor]]"}}}
