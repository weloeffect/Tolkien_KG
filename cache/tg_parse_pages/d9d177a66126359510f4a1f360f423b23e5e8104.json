It was extended in the latter edition.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Aragorn]] sees the [[The Lighting of the Beacons|lit beacon]] and rushes to the [[Golden Hall]] where [[Théoden]] is, shouting \"The beacons are lit! [[Gondor]] calls for aid!\" After a long moment, Théoden decides that [[Rohan]] will answer the call and ride to Gondor's aid.<ref group=\"note\">In the scene ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', \"[[The Palantír (scene)|The Palantír]]\", when [[Gandalf]] told Théoden to be ready to ride to Gondor if called upon, Théoden suggested he may not go, saying \"Why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours? What do we owe Gondor?\"</ref> \nThe [[Rohirrim]] get ready to leave; Théoden gives orders to [[Éomer]] and [[Gamling]] to bring riders from across Rohan to [[Dunharrow]], where the army will be assembled. \n\n[[Éowyn]] readies her horse. Aragorn is surprised by this, but she claims \"it is tradition for the women of the court to farewell the men\". He sees her hidden sword but she covers it back up and tells him \"You have given us hope\". \n\n[[Merry]] offers his service to Théoden, who gladly accepts. \"You shall be Meriadoc, esquire of Rohan,\" Théoden says, much to Merry's delight.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Legolas]] and [[Gimli]] ready themselves to leave. Gimli scoffs at the horsemen and wishes for an army of [[dwarves]]. However, Legolas suggests that war may be approaching the lands of the dwarves too. \n\nThéoden watches his men gravely.\n{{blockquote|So ... It is before the walls of [[Minas Tirith]] that the doom of our time will be decided.|[[Théoden]]}}\nÉomer rallies the men of Rohan, and they all depart from [[Edoras]], with Merry in amongst them. \n\n{{notes}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King scenes|20]]"}}}
