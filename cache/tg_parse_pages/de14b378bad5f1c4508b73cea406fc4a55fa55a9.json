It is often called an [[audiobooks|audiobook]], though it is not.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe series contains the four stories in ''Tales from the Perilous Realm'': ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]'', ''[[Smith of Wootton Major]]'', ''[[Leaf by Niggle]]'' and ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]''. ''The Adventures of Tom Bombadil'' is the dramatization of Tom's scenes with the four Hobbits in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', rather than a retelling of the events of the poems ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil (poem)|The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'' and ''[[Bombadil Goes Boating]]''. Brian Sibley had expressed some pity in not including it in his [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|radio adaptation]], and decided to include it here [http://briansibleytheworks.blogspot.com/2008/01/this-page-is-still-under-construction_23.html].\n\n==Air dates==\n''Farmer Giles of Ham'' was aired in two parts, the first on [[16 August|August 16]], [[1992]], and the second on [[23 August|August 23]]. ''Smith of Wootton Major'' was broadcast a week later, on [[30 August|August 30]]. ''The Adventures of Tom Bombadil'' was also aired in two parts, on [[6 September|September 6]] and [[13 September|September 13]], and ''Leaf by Niggle'' on [[20 September|September 20]]. \n\n==Cast==\n===Farmer Giles of Ham===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!
