He accompanied the procession carrying [[Théoden]] and [[Éowyn]] into the [[Minas Tirith|city]].<ref>{{RK|Battle}}</ref> As Merry ascended the city roads, he became separated from the group. He then encountered [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], who was startled and glad. Pippin noticed that Merry was stumbling badly. Merry's right arm was paralysed after he stabbed the [[Witch-king|Nazgûl]]. Pippin escorted Merry to the [[Houses of Healing]]. \n\nMerry was lain upon a bed near Éowyn and [[Faramir]], who was injured by an [[Southrons|Southron]] arrow. The three of them grew steadily sicker from the [[Black Breath]] as Gandalf stood nearby. [[Ioreth]] recalled a legend of Gondor, which said, \"The hands of the king are the hands of a healer, and so shall the rightful king be known.\"\n\n[[Aragorn]] furled his banner and ordered his men to prepare tents outside the city. He refused to claim his throne until the war with [[Mordor]] was decided, for good or ill. Aragorn planned to wait outside the gate until the [[Stewards of Gondor|Lord of Minas Tirith]] bade him to enter. At [[Gandalf]]'s request, Aragorn entered the city with [[Éomer]] and [[Imrahil]] in the guise of a Ranger. Aragorn, learning of Denethor’s fate, assigned Imrahil to act as the interim leader of [[Gondor]]. Aragorn, Éomer, and Imrahil secretly agreed, though, that Gandalf was their true leader for the remainder of the war against Mordor. Gandalf recalled what [[Ioreth]] had said, implying that only Aragorn could save those wounded by the Enemy.\n\n[[Aragorn]], [[Éomer]], [[Imrahil]], and [[Gandalf]] entered the [[Houses of Healing]], where they met [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]]. Aragorn looked at [[Faramir]], [[Éowyn]], and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], noting that Faramir was in most urgent need of help. Aragorn asked [[Ioreth]] and the [[herb-master]] of the Houses of Healing for ''[[athelas]]''. Neither of them understood the virtues of the herb. When [[Bergil]], entered with the ''athelas'', Aragorn crushed its leaves, and stirred them in a bowl of hot water. The sweet scent of the herb awoke Faramir from his fever. Faramir immediately affirmed Aragorn as his superior and king. Aragorn and Éomer discussed Éowyn. Aragorn then tended to Éowyn and Merry, who both returned to consciousness at the scent of the ''athelas''. All through the night, Aragorn healed the wounded of the city. Rumours flew throughout the city that the King of Gondor now walked again, bringing healing in his hands. As foretold at Aragorn's birth, the people called him [[Elfstone]],<ref>{{App|Tale}}</ref> after the green gem that he wore around his neck, which [[Galadriel]] had given to him earlier.<ref>{{FR|Farewell}}</ref>{{references}}\n[[Category:The Return of the King chapters|Houses of Healing]]"}}}
