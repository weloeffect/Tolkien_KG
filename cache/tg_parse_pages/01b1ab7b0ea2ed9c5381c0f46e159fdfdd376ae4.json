In the wanderings of [[Smith Smithson|Smith]] about the land he once came upon the desolate shore of this sea and beheld the great blue waves that rolled out of Unlight to the strand.  The sea bore white ships that returned from battles on the Dark Marches.  Smith saw one ship brought in on a silent wave whose eleven mariners sang a song of triumph which shook Smith's heart with fear.  After this incident Smith never returned to this shore.<ref>[[J.R.R.
