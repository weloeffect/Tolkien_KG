I think it is a very generous gift. It will probably be of considerable use to me when I have time to turn to the correction and improvement of the index provided in the revised edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' published last year. It is the only index material I have received that takes in the Appendices, and these references will save me a lot of time. Thank you also for telling me of the pleasure you and your family have found in my works.<br/><br/>Yours sincerely,<br/><br/>J.R.R. Tolkien}}\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Letters|Morland, Oscar]]"}}}
