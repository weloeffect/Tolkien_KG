'''Drúadan''') or '''Drúath''' (sg. '''Drû''') was a race of wild [[Men]]. The [[Rohirrim]] called them '''Woses''' or '''Wild Men of the Woods'''. \n\nThey were a good-hearted, though primitive people who suffered persecution, both by the malice of [[Men of Darkness|evil people]]; and by ignorance, as their \"unlovely\" appearance (according to the [[Elves]]) led many to believe they were savage beasts. Although some of their numbers joined the [[Edain]] and some briefly remained on [[Númenor]], they largely held themselves apart from the troubles and calamities of [[Middle-earth]], and possessed their own mysterious ways and magic.\n\n==History==\n===First Age===\nThe Drúedain were part of the [[Edain]] who left [[Hildórien]] for the [[Westlands|West]]. They had been harried and persecuted by other [[Men]] as long as they could remember. This treatment turned them to be secretive and suspicious of other kinds of Men and made them migrate to the west to find a land where they could live hidden and in peace.<ref name=\"TD\">{{UT|12b}}</ref>\n\nHistorians in [[Gondor]] believed that the Drúedain came from lands south of [[Mordor]], and turned north into [[Ithilien]] before they reached the coasts of [[Harad]]waith and were the first Men to cross the [[Anduin]] (probably near [[Cair Andros]]). They then settled in the vales on both sides of the [[White Mountains]] and in the wooded lands at the northern feet of the White Mountains.<ref name=\"TD\" /> The Drúedain carved statues of themselves of stone in [[Dunharrow]], which were later called [[Púkel-men]] by the [[Rohirrim]] when the Rohirrim settled in Rohan in the Third Age.<ref name=\"Note14\">{{UT|12c}}, note 14</ref>\n\nAt the end of the First Age most of the Drúedain remained in the White Mountains despite attacks by Men from the East who had relapsed to the service of the Dark. A small branch of the Drúedain, which consisted of a few hundred people,<ref name=\"Druedain\">{{UT|Druedain}}</ref> migrated to the west and accompanied the [[Haladin]] to [[Beleriand]] and settled in the forest of [[Brethil]].<ref name=\"TD\" /> Few of the Drúedain ever left the Forest of Brethil,<ref name=\"Druedain\" /> but a few of them lived in the household of [[Húrin]] of the folk of [[Hador]] who was related to the lord of the Haladin and had lived with the Haladin in his youth.<ref>{{UT|12c}}, note 8</ref> When the Haladin fell into ruin and [[Morgoth]] had destroyed all the realms and strongholds of [[Elves]] and Men, the Drúedain of Brethil dwindled to a few families, mostly women and children, of which some found refuge at the [[Mouths of Sirion]].<ref name=\"Druedain\" />\n\n===Second Age===\nWhen the Dúnedain of Beleriand set forth for the island of [[Elenna]], where they would establish the kingdom of [[Númenor]], the Drúedain refugees who had dwelt at the Mouths of Sirion were permitted to join them, where their numbers increased again.<ref name=\"Note7\">{{UT|12c}}, note 7</ref>\n\nMeanwhile in the east, the Drúedain of the White Mountains were driven off their homes by wicked, tall [[Men of Darkness|Men]] from the East. Remnants of the Drúedain survived in [[Drúadan Forest]] in [[Anórien]] at the eastern end of the White Mountains and in [[Drúwaith Iaur]] in the mountains of the [[Andrast|Cape of Andrast]] at the western end of the White Mountains.<ref name=\"TD\" />\n\nAfter the felling of trees in [[Enedwaith]] by the [[Númenóreans]] as a source of timber for the building of ships at ship-yards at [[Lond Daer]] and elsewhere in Middle-earth and in [[Númenor]] became devastating, the native [[Pre-Númenóreans]] who lived in the forests ambushed the Númenóreans and had to flee east to the foothills of the southern [[Misty Mountains]] to the region, which was later called [[Dunland]].<ref name=\"Gwathlo34\">{{UT|6d}}, essay on the name Gwathló, third and fourth paragraph</ref> They did not cross the river [[Isen]] to [[Drúwaith Iaur]] in the promontory between the Isen and the [[Lefnui]], because they were afraid of the Drúedain who lived there and whom they regarded as a \"fell people\".<ref name=\"TD\" /><ref name=\"Gwathlo34\" />\n\nMeanwhile, the Drúedain living on Númenor started leaving the island during the time of [[Tar-Aldarion]], [[foresight|foreseeing]] the evil that would come.

The Drúedain lead the Rohirrim along an alternate road through the [[Stonewain Valley]] in Drúadan Forest, and scouted for and hunted possible enemy spies therein, so that the Rohirrim could reach the [[Pelennor Fields]] without being ambushed. When king Théoden offered the Drúedain a rich reward and the eternal friendship of the Rohan for their offered help, Ghân-buri-Ghân asked king Théoden to leave the Drúedain alone in the woods and  to never again hunt them like beasts.<ref>{{RK|Ride}}, p. 831-836</ref>  \n\nAfter the [[War of the Ring]], towards the end of July {{TA|3019}},<ref>{{App|Chief}}, entry for July 22 of the year 3019</ref> [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] granted the Drúadan Forest to be theirs forever, forbidding anyone to enter without their permission.<ref>{{RK|Partings}}, p. 976</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe appearance of the Drúedain was regarded as \"unlovely\" by Elves and Men. They were short with an average height of four feet,<ref name=\"atani\" /> very broad with heavy buttocks and thick short legs.<ref name=\"Druedain\" /> In build, stature, and endurance, they resembled the [[Dwarves]].<ref name=\"atani\" />\n\nThey had wide faces with deep-set eyes with heavy brows and flat noses. Their wide mouths were the most expressive of their usually impassive features. They had small, sunken eyes that were so black the pupils could not be distinguished, though their eyes glowed red when they were angry or suspicious. Their hair was sparse and lank, never growing below the eyebrows with the exception of some men who grew black tufts on their chins.<ref name=\"Druedain\" />\n\nThe Drúedain spoke in deep, guttural voices, though their laughter was hearty and pleasantly contagious to other Men and even Elves.<ref name=\"Druedain\" />\n\n==Culture==\nThe Drúedain were primitive, but marvellously skilled trackers with a better sense of smell than other Men, knew all about plants, were skilled in the carving of wood or stone and had mysterious powers of clairvoyance<ref name=\"Note7\" /> and [[magic]] related to the animation of statues made from stone in their likeness.<ref name=\"Druedain\" /> \n\nThe Drúedain were merry in temperament and character like [[Hobbits]], but could be sardonic and ruthless on the grimmer side of their nature, but were less grim than Dwarves. They were frugal and ate sparingly and drank only water, even during peaceful or plentiful times.<ref name=\"atani\" />\n\nA hardy people, in the late First Age they used caves in the mountains as store-houses, which they used also as sleeping-places during severe weather. They maintained this custom in Beleriand (except the most hardy). These places were guarded and didn't allow even their [[Haladin]] friends to enter. Otherwise they were content to live in tents or makeshift shelters built round large trees.<ref name=\"atani\" />\n\nFor weapons, the Drúedain used poisoned darts<ref name=\"TD\" /> and poisoned arrows.<ref>{{RK|Ride}}, p. 830</ref>\n\nThe Drúedain had a lore of plants not possessed by most of the Edain, nor even the [[Elves]], including knowledge about the edible [[mushrooms|fungi]]. To the surprise of the other peoples, the Drúedain cultured fungi and enjoyed them as food. They passed this knowledge to the [[Haladin]].<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, n. 52; however Tolkien later discarded the note believing that this trait made the Drúedain \"too like Hobbits\".</ref>\n\n==Language==\nThe Drúedain of the Drúadan Forest spoke their own language, [[Drúadan language|Drúadan]],<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> which was completely alien to [[Westron]].<ref name=\"OfMen\">{{App|Men}}, penultimate paragraph, p. 1129</ref> The only known words in Drúadan are the name ''[[Ghân]]'', the element ''[[buri]]'' (\"son of\")<ref>{{PE|17}}, entry '''Ghân buri Ghân''', p. 99</ref> and the name ''[[gorgûn]]'' (\"orcs\", \"orc-folk\").<ref>{{PE|17}}, entry '''gorgûn''' and entry '''druadan''', p. 99</ref>\n\nThe Drúedain of the Forest of Brethil who lived there with the [[Haladin|Folk of Haleth]] spoke the language of the Folk of Haleth after their own fashion, but retained a number of words of their own.<ref>{{UT|12c}}, note 3</ref> It is possible that they retained their own language and that they only used the language of the Folk of Haleth when they talked with them, because even the Folk of Haleth called them ''drûg'', which was their name in the \"own language\" of the Drúedain.<ref>{{UT|Druedain}}, second paragraph</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Druedain.mp3|Ardamir}}\n''Drúedain'' is a [[Sindarin]] name. It is the plural form of Drúadan<ref name=\"Note6\">{{UT|12c}}, note 6</ref> and means \"wild men\" or \"woses\".<ref name=\"druadan\">{{PE|17}}, entry '''druadan''', p. 99</ref> The element ''[[Drû]]'' is an adaptation into Sindarin of ''[[Drughu]]'', which is what the Drúedain call themselves in their own language. As the [[Elves]] came to know the Drû better, and to recognise their bitter enmity to the [[Orcs]], they added the title ''[[Edain]]'' to their name.<ref name=\"Note6\" />\n\nThe word ''Wose'' represents [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s translation of the actual word ''[[róg]]'' in the language of the [[Rohirrim]].<ref name=\"Note14\"/> It means \"wild man of the woods\". It is a modernization of the Anglo-Saxon word ''wása''.<ref name=\"Note14\" /> The [[Old English]] element ''wasa'' originally meant a forlorn or abandoned person. It occurs in ''wudewasa'' meaning \"wild, neglected\". It is seen in the name ''Wuduwasas'', which is the direct inspiration for the Woses and means \"savage men\" (of the woods).<ref name=\"Woses\">{{HM|N}}, entry '''Woses''', pp. 764</ref>\n\n==Other names==\n*'''[[Drú]]/Drúin:''' the simple [[Sindarin]] name for the Drughu, singular and plural.<ref name=\"Note6\" />\n*'''Drúath:''' another Sindarin plural form of Drú.<ref name=\"Note6\" />\n*'''Drû-folk:''' rarely used collective term.<ref name=\"Note6\" />\n*'''[[Púkel-men]]:''' the name used by the Rohirrim in Rohan for the statues on the road to Dunharrow<ref>{{RK|Muster}}, p. 794</ref> and for the Drúedain.<ref>{{UT|Index}}, entry ''Púkel-men''</ref>\n*'''[[Rú]]/[[Rúatani]]:''' Quenya terms for the Drughu, derived from their Sindarin counterparts.

Both the description of Woses, as well as the word \"Wose\" itself, derives from this folkloric figure. According to [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] his idea was to show the actual existence of wild folk, remnants of former peoples driven out by invaders, living a debased and savage life in forests and mountains.<ref name=\"Woses\"/>\n\nIn the ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (poem)|Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'' poem, the word ''[[wodwo]]s'' appears, which Tolkien translated as \"wood-[[trolls]]\".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 555</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Drúedain in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Cortney Skinner - Woses of the Eryn Vorn (MECCG).jpg|\"Woses of the Eryn Vorn\" in the ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Drúedain .jpg|A Wose in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n'''1995-8: ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]'':'''\n:The card game features three different factions of the race: the \"Woses of the [[Drúadan Forest]]\" and the \"Woses of Old Pûkel-land\" in the set ''[[Middle-earth: The Wizards|The Wizards]]'', and the \"Woses of the [[Eryn Vorn]]\" in the expansion ''[[Middle-earth: Against the Shadow|Against the Shadow]]''.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.tradecardsonline.com/im/searchCards|articlename=(Results from search for cards in the game Middle Earth)|dated=|website=[http://www.tradecardsonline.com/ Tradecardsoneline.com]|accessed=27 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n'''2016: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Other than the settlement in the [[Drúadan Forest]], another group of Drúedain is found in [[Mordor]] where their ancestors stayed before migrating westward. At the end of the [[First Age]], a cataclysm caused the mountains to rise and cut off the Nêbh Rûdh, the Red Sky Clan, from the valley which they shared with [[Easterlings]]. Separated from the [[Plateau of Gorgoroth]] to the west by an unreachable mountain pass, they were trapped within a small forest where they lived in peace and isolation for thousands of years, away from the Great Eye's reach. When the [[One Ring]] is destroyed, the eruption of [[Mount Doom]] causes a rockslide that makes the pass traversable again, exposing the Red Sky Clan to whatever evil still remains lurking in Mordor.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[The Faithful Stone]]''\n\n==External links==\n*[[Wikipedia:Woodwoses|Woodwoses]] at Wikipedia\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Druedain}}\n[[Category:Drúedain| ]]\n[[Category:Men]]\n[[Category:Sindarin demonyms]]\n\n[[de:Drúedain]]\n[[fr:encyclo:peuples:hommes:druedain]]\n[[fi:Drúedain]]"}}}
