The march-wardens led them to Thingol, and they brought news from [[Nargothrond]]. [[Morwen]] then fled Doriath seeking news of her son, and Mablung with hardy march-wardens were tasked to bring her back.

The term ''march'' is an archaic and seldom-used word for a border, and a synonym for ''warden'' is \"guard\"; therefore, a march-warden is a border-guard. Other kingdoms in later ages, besides Doriath, likely had Marchwardens as well; but if they did, it is not mentioned in any others of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien's]] works. One character, however, who may well have been a Marchwarden, was [[Haldir]] of [[Lothlórien]], as he identified himself as a border-guard in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':  {{Quote|\"...But there are some of us still who go abroad for the gathering of news and the watching of our enemies, and they speak the languages of other lands. I am one. Haldir is my name.\"|Haldir}}\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Positions and occupations]]\n[[Category:Sindar]]"}}}
