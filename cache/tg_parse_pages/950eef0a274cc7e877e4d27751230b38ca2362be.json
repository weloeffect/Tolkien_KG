Vincent on the religious elements of Tolkien's work, especially the \"recovery\" and \"escape\" which Tolkien discusses in [[On Fairy-Stories]], in its influence on fantasy by Jewish authors (specifically considering Lev Grossman's ''[[Wikipedia:The Magicians (Grossman novel)|The Magicians]]'' trilogy).\n\n==From the Publisher==\n{{blockquote|Recent scholarship on Tolkien has been especially attentive not only to the importance of religion in his personal life, but also to the wider theological implications which may be drawn from his works. In this study, Alana M. Vincent argues that the cultural influence of The Lord of the Rings provides an excellent model for understanding the mutually transformative relationship between religion and culture, and in so doing also provides an important and unexplored pathway for inter-religious exchange.}}\n\n==Contents==\n\n* Introduction\n* Chapter One: Culture and Canon\n* Chapter Two: Creation and Communion\n* Chapter Three: Recovery\n* Chapter Four: Tolkienian Fairy-Story and Inter-Religious Exchange\n\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]"}}}
