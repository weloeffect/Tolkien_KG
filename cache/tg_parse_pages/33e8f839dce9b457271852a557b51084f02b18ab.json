Elendil tells his son that he cannot be corrupted by the servants of [[Morgoth]] due to being Valandil his father being the \"chief of the wise men of [[Númenor]].<ref name=P1/>\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Valandil'' is [[Quenya]], being a compound of ''vanan'' (\"god\") + ''(-n)dil'' (\"friend\"). Its [[Old English]] cognate was ''[[Oswin Errol|Oswine]]'', which also means \"God-friend\".<ref>{{LR|P1III1}}</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nIn another stage of the [[Legendarium]] separate from ''[[The Lost Road]]'', Valandil was the brother of [[Elendil]] the Tall. In this stage, Valandil had the role of [[Anarion]] and founded [[Gondor|Ondor]].<ref>{{LR|P1II4}}, pp. 33-4</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n\n{{Title}}\n\n[[Category:Númenóreans]]\n[[Category:The Lost Road]]"}}}
