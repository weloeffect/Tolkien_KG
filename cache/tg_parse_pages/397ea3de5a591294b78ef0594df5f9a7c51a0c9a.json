The Anglo-Saxons and Vikings believed their universe was held together by an interlaced web of golden threads visible only to wizards, and at its centre was the realm of Middle-earth, peopled by humans but imbued with spiritual power. Drawing on historical and archaeological research, Brian Bates uncovers the Middle-earth that centres on England - a home to dragons, elves, dwarves and demons - a land where spells had real force.}}\n\n{{References}}\n{{title|italics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Real Middle-earth, The}}\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]"}}}
