In the south, it was an east-west range that divided [[Dor-lómin]] and [[Mithrim]] to the north from [[Beleriand]] to the south, then in the east it curved around to the northwest, forming the boundary of [[Hithlum]] and separating it from [[Anfauglith]]. The [[Mountains of Mithrim]] were a northwesterly spur that separated Dor-lómin from Mithrim. \n\nSeveral rivers arose in the Ered Wethrin, including [[Narog]], [[Taeglin]], and [[Sirion]] with its [[Eithel Sirion|source]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThey were among the mountains raised about [[Hithlum]] during the [[Battle of the Powers]].<ref name=\"Captivity\">{{S|Captivity}}</ref> \n\nWhen the [[Noldor]] [[House of Fëanor|followers of Fëanor]] arrived to Middle-earth, they were first attacked by [[Orcs]] in [[Lake Mithrim]]. The [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]] began there, but the Noldor pursued the Orcs among the Mountains of Shadow to [[Ard-galen]]. However, Fëanor did not stop there and was mortally wounded before reaching [[Angband]]. He was saved by his [[Sons of Fëanor|sons]] and brought back to the slopes of the Ered Wethrin, and while going upward the path in Eithel Sirion, he died there while watching [[Thangorodrim]] in the distance.<ref name=Return>{{S|Return}}</ref>\n\nAfter the coming of the host of [[Fingolfin]] and the rising of the [[Sun]], [[Morgoth]]'s armies ran back to Angband, but Fingolfin chose to withdraw to Mithrim, having the Ered Wethrin as a shield.<ref name=Return/>\n\nLater, [[Nevrast]], Dor-lómin, Mithrim, and Hithlum were given to Fingolfin and his sons, so all the mountain range became under the protection of the [[House of Fingolfin]]. Several fortresses were built here,<ref>{{S|ruin}}</ref> with the main fortress being [[Barad Eithel]] from which they watched Ard-galen and their cavalry came upon the plain.<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref> \n\nThe Ered Wethrin disappeared beneath the waves at the end of the First Age.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Ered Wethrin'' is [[Sindarin]] for \"Shadowy Mountains\".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 43</ref> It consists of ''[[ered]]'' (\"mountains\") and ''[[gwathren|gwethrin]]'' (\"shadowy\").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entries ''orod'', ''gwath''</ref>\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Beleriand]]\n[[Category:Mountain ranges]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[de:Ered Wethrin]]\n[[fi:Ered Wethrin]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/reliefs/beleriand/ered wethrin]]"}}}
