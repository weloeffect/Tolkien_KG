Tolkien]]. All books included  in this series were edited by Christopher.\n\nThe series includes 6 boxed sets, each containing 3-4 volumes. The volumes are bound in hardcover, featuring double-sided dustjackets, which can be removed and put back in reverse. Set #1 - #4 are the \"[[legendarium]]\" books, including ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', and 12 ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' volumes. Their dustjackets reproduce on one side the original covers of the first hardcover editions, on the other side the illustrated covers of the first paperback editions, by [[John Howe]].\n\nSet #5 is a \"Myths and Legends\" set, including ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo]]'', ''[[The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún]]'', ''[[The Fall of Arthur]]'', and ''[[Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary]]''.\n\nSet #6 is a reissue of the three \"Great Tales of Middle-earth\" books, but published as a single box for the first time in UK by HarperCollins. These do not have the reversible dustjackets.\n\nA second \"Myths and Legends\" box, containing 5 books by J.R.R. Tolkien, is planned to release in May 2026. It most notably includes the first ever reprint of ''[[The Old English Exodus]]'' since its 1982 publication.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"185px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Christopher Tolkien Centenary Set 1.png|Box #1<br>[[The Silmarillion]]<br>[[Unfinished Tales]]<br>[[The Book of Lost Tales I]]<br>[[The Book of Lost Tales II]]\nFile:Christopher Tolkien Centenary Set 2.png|Box #2<br>[[The Lays of Beleriand]]<br>[[The Shaping of Middle-earth]]<br>[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]\nFile:Christopher Tolkien Centenary Set 3.png|Box #3<br>[[The Return of the Shadow]]<br>[[The Treason of Isengard]]<br>[[The War of the Ring]]<br>[[Sauron Defeated]]\nFile:Christopher Tolkien Centenary Set 4.png|Box #4<br>[[Morgoth's Ring]]<br>[[The War of the Jewels]]<br>[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]<br>[[The History of Middle-earth Index|Index]]\nFile:Myths and Legends Set 1.png|Myths & Legends #1<br>[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo|Sir Gawain & Green Knight]]<br>[[The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún|Sigurd and Gudrún]]<br>[[The Fall of Arthur]]<br>[[Beowulf: A Translation and Commentary|Beowulf: A Translation]]\nFile:Christopher Tolkien Centenary Set 6.jpg|Great Tales<br>[[The Children of Húrin]]<br>[[Beren and Lúthien]]<br>[[The Fall of Gondolin]]\nFile:Myths and Legends Set 2.jpg|Myths & Legends #2<br>[[The Old English Exodus]]<br>[[Finn and Hengest]]<br>[[The Story of Kullervo]]<br>[[The Lay of Aotrou and Itroun]]<br>[[The Battle of Maldon: together with The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth|The Battle of Maldon]]\n</gallery>\n* Box #1: [[HarperCollins]], hardcover, 7 December 2023, ISBN 978-0008663162\n* Box #2: [[HarperCollins]], hardcover, 28 March 2024, ISBN 978-0008669232\n* Box #3: [[HarperCollins]], hardcover, 6 June 2024, ISBN 978-0008669294\n* Box #4: [[HarperCollins]], hardcover, 15 August 2024, ISBN 978-0008669393\n* Myths and Legends #1: [[HarperCollins]], hardcover, 24 April 2025, ISBN 978-0008737757\n* Great Tales: [[HarperCollins]], hardcover, 14 August 2025, ISBN 978-0008360108\n* Myths and Legends #2: [[HarperCollins]], hardcover, May 2026, ISBN 978-0008795184\n\n==Saga of King Heidrek==\n[[File:The Saga of King Heidrek the Wise 2025.jpg|right|150px]]\nThough not part of the series, Christopher's translation ''[[The Saga of King Heidrek the Wise]]'', an academic work on an Icelandic saga originally published in [[1960]], has also been reissued for this occasion.\n* [[HarperCollins]], paperback, 5 May 2025, ISBN 978-0008767631\n\n==See also==\n* [[Tolkien Signature Paperback Series]]\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.tolkienguide.com/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?post_id=51420 Box review] on Tolkienguide.com\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History of Middle-earth}}\n[[Category:Books by Christopher Tolkien]]\n[[Category:Publications by J.R.R.
