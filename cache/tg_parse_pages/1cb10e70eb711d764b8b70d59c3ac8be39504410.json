The [[Kine of Araw]] were found in the fields of Rhûn near the Inland Sea.<ref>{{RK|V1}}</ref><ref>{{App|South}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe [[River Running|Celduin]] flowed from the north-west into an arm of the sea. West of the Sea of Rhûn was the land of [[Dorwinion]], and roughly 200 miles (300&nbsp;km) to the south was the eastern end of the [[Ered Lithui]].\n\nA forest stood at the north-eastern shore of the sea, and near the south-western shore there were many hills. The south-eastern part of the Sea seems to be occupied by a small wooded island.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, the scale of the General Map of Middle-earth is so small, that the symbols for the trees on the island only appear like dots, p. 691</ref><ref>On [[The First Map of The Lord of the Rings]] the forest on the northeastern corner of the Sea of Rûn, which was called Rhûnaer on that map has a green colour and the island in the east of the Rhûnaer has the same green colour</ref><ref>{{TI|MII}}, Map II, The island in the Sea is coloured green on the First Map, and is marked as wooded on the 1943 Map, p. 307</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn the [[Years of the Trees]] during the time of the [[Great Journey]], the [[Eldar]] reached the Sea of Rhûn after marching 450 miles west or northwest from [[Cuiviénen]].<ref name=NM>{{NM|P1vii}}, pp. 47, 49</ref> The craft of ship-making practised by the [[Teleri]] reached new heights in their efforts to traverse the Sea of Rhûn on their westward journey.<ref name=Last>{{PM|Last}} pp. 391-392</ref>\n\nIn the [[First Age]], the shores of the Inland Sea were populated by tribes of [[Men]] who were migrating to the [[West]]. The [[House of Bëor|Lesser Folk]] arrived there first and dwelt at the feet of the nearby hills. The [[House of Hador|Greater Folk]] came later in the north-east woods near the shores. The Men crafted boats and could sail the sea, but they did not meet often, and their languages soon diverged<ref>{{PM|Ros}}</ref> before they resumed their journey to [[Beleriand]].\n\nIn the early [[Third Age]], the [[Kings of Gondor]] such as [[Rómendacil I]] campaigned to those lands, and [[Turambar (King of Gondor)|Turambar]] expanded the kingdom to the East. By the time of King [[Hyarmendacil I]], the Inland Sea formed one of the boundaries of [[Gondor]].<ref name=gondor/>\n\n[[Vorondil]] hunted the Kine of Araw near the shores of the Sea.<ref name=gondor>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>\n\nDuring the time of [[Rómendacil II]], the Inland Sea was apparently within the borders of the power of [[Gondor]].\n\n==Etymology==\n{{pronounce|Sindarin - Rhûn.mp3|Gilgamesh}}''[[Rhûn]]'' is simply [[Sindarin]] for \"East\".<ref>{{App|E2i}}</ref>\n\nIn the drafts for ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Tolkien]] considered calling the Sea ''Rhûnaer''<ref name=MII>{{TI|MII}}, Map II, p. 307</ref> or ''Rúnaeluin''.<ref>{{SD|VII}}, p. 65. Cf. note 9</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn the drafts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the sea was called the '''Sea of Rhûnaer'''. In the earlier maps, part of the Sea was more clearly occupied by a heavily wooded island.<ref name=MII/> In the published maps by [[Christopher Tolkien]], the island is represented by a dotted pattern.<ref>{{FR|Map}}</ref> The reason for this change and what it signifies was never specified by C. Tolkien. There is no trace of the unnamed island in [[Pauline Baynes]]'s ''[[A Map of Middle-earth]]''.\n\nIn a [[1948]] note on his ''[[General Map of Middle-earth]]'', [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] drew an arrow from the [[River Running]] with the direction to the end of the map, and carries the note: \"''To '''Sea of Rûnaer'''''. [[Wayne G. Hammond|Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull|Scull]] suggest that ''Rûnaer'' is likely an alternative name of ''Rhûn''.<ref>{{HM|AoL}}, p. 199</ref>\n\nAlso in these early draft of the maps for ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Tolkien indicated that ''[[Neldoreth (Rhûn)|Neldoreth]]'' was the name of the forest bordering the Sea of Rhûn's north-eastern shore. This forest went unnamed in later maps.<ref name=MII/>\n\n==Theories==\nChristopher Tolkien once questioned whether the Sea of Rhûn could \"...be identified with the [[Sea of Helcar]], vastly shrunken\".<ref>{{WJ|Two}} p. 174.</ref> [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] adopted this position in making ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]''. However, in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'' and ''[[The Nature of Middle-earth]]'', which were published after Fonstad's ''Atlas'', the Sea of Rhûn and its surrounding geographical landmarks exist as far back as the [[Years of the Trees]] of the [[First Age]] at the time of the [[Great Journey]], hundreds of miles west of where the Elves awoke near the Sea of Helcar.<ref name=NM /><ref name=Last/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[East Sea]]\n* [[Sea of Helcar]]\n* [[Sea of Ringil]]\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sea of Rhun}}\n[[Category:Eastern lands]]\n[[Category:Lakes]]\n[[Category:Rhovanion]]\n[[Category:Rhûn]]\n[[Category:Seas and oceans]]\n[[de:Meer von Rhûn]]\n[[fi:Rhûnin Järvi]]\n[[fr:/encyclo/geographie/eaux/mer_de_rhun]]"}}}
