He delves into the differences between various forms of fantasy and digs out answers needed by every parent, youth worker, teacher, and student.\n\nThe stories of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]], Lewis, and Rowling—and films based on them—have touched millions of lives. How are these authors similar...and different? Where do they fit into today’s ever–growing desire for the mystery and magic fantasy provides? Abanes—himself a fantasy and science–fiction fan—helps shed light on this form of entertainment and its effects on today’s youth.\n\nReaders will come away thoroughly equipped to differentiate between stories and films that are harmless, even inspiring—and those containing spiritual dangers.\n\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Film books]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]"}}}
