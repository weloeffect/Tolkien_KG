The last of the Turtle-fish was named ''[[Fastitocalon]]''.<ref name=Poem>{{AB|Fastitocalon}}</ref>\n\nTurtle-fish appeared as treacherous islands, really being monsters capable of drowning seafarers.<ref name=Poem/><ref name=L255>{{L|255}}; see also \"[[Letter to Eileen Elgar (5 March 1964)]]\" (letter)</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\n\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] was inspired by an [[Old English]] bestiary, appearing in the [[Wikipedia:Exeter Book|Exeter Book]]. The idea of giant marine turtles ultimately derives from Eastern myths, and in the European versions the monster is often confused with whales.<ref name=L255/>\n\n==Other version of the legendarium==\n\nIt is never explained whether the turtle-fish was an actual race or just a fictional character for the poem \"[[Fastitocalon (poem)|Fastitocalon]]\". In an earlier version of the [[legendarium]], [[Ulmo]], Lord of the Waters, uses his giant whale, [[Uin]], to drag [[Tol Eressëa]] towards [[Aman]].<ref>{{HM|LT1}}</ref> This whale reappears in [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s story ''[[Roverandom]]''. It is thinkable that Tolkien, in an early phase of the mythology, imagined the fastitocalon to be another one of Ulmo's creatures. \n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''1982-2007: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''\n:Turtle-fish, also called ''Fell Turtles'' and ''Festitycelyn'', are described as monsters that can grow as large as fifty feet in length, and that live both in the seas and in the large rivers and lakes.<ref>{{ICE|2012}}</ref><ref>{{ICE|2025}}</ref><ref>{{ICE|8040}}</ref>\n\n'''1995-1997: ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]'':'''\n:The card \"Fell Turtle\", released in the set ''[[Middle-earth: The Wizards|METW]]'', is a Hazard Creature.\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:''Dread-turtles'', huge reptiles with spiky shells, are possibly inspired by the Turtle-fish. The largest dread-turtle, found in [[Rohan]], is referred to as the Fastitocalon.\n\n{{references}}\n{{Legend}}\n[[Category:Other races]]"}}}
