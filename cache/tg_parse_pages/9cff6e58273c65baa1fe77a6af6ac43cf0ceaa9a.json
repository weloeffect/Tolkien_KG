By the Rohirrim themselves, Rohan was usually called '''[[The Mark]]'''.\n\nFor the subsequent history of the Rohirrim as allies of Gondor see [[Rohan#History]]\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[Image:John Howe - Rohirrim.jpg|thumb|left|''Rohirrim'' by [[John Howe]]]]\nThe Rohirrim were tall, blond, and mostly had blue eyes. They prized their horses more than anything, and their entire culture was based around these. They had few cities, but lived in many villages on the plains of Rohan. \n\n:''They are proud and wilful, but they are true-hearted, generous in thought and deed; bold but not cruel; wise but unlearned, writing no books but singing many songs, after the manner of the children of Men before the Dark Years. '' &#8212; [[The Two Towers]]\n\n==Culture==\nThe Rohirrim had had contacts with [[Elves]] in their ancient history and knew of [[Ilúvatar|Eru]], but like the Dúnedain they did not worship him in any temples. They seem to have valued the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Oromë]] the Hunter highly, whom they called [[Oromë#History|Béma]]. \n\nThey measured time with a calendar that came from the [[Men of the Vales of Anduin]] and had apparent similarities to the [[Shire Calendar|Calendars of the Shire]] and [[Bree Calendar|Bree]], and to that of the [[Dale]].<ref>{{App|D1}}</ref> These similarities were noted by [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] in his work ''[[Reckoning of Years]]''.<ref>{{FR|Records}}</ref>\n\nThey were ruled by a line of kings descended from Eorl the Young, who had first brought them to Rohan, and in times of war, all able men rode to meet the Muster of Rohan.\n\n===[[Horses]]===\n[[Image:Peter Xavier Price - The Ride of the Rohirrim.jpg|thumb|right|''The Ride of the Rohirrim'' by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]]\nThe Rohirrim are famous as skilled horsemen, masters and breeders. Among the horses of the Rohirrim are the famed [[Mearas]], the noblest and fastest horses who have ever roamed [[Arda]]; [[Shadowfax]] was the greatest of all Mearas. There were very few Mearas left in Middle-earth at this point, but there were enough that a breeding population was present. The armies of Rohan are almost exclusively cavalry, divided into irregular units termed [[éoreds]]. Rohan's armies were more of a very well trained militia called upon in times of war, with the actual standing army relatively small. The professional career-soldiers of Rohan may have been limited to the royal bodyguard at Edoras.\n\nIt was because of this close affiliation with horses, both in war and peace, that they received their now famous name. ''Rohirrim'' (or more properly ''Rochirrim'') is [[Sindarin]] for \"Horse-lords,\" and ''Rohan'' (or ''Rochand'') meant \"Land of the Horse-lords.\" These names were devised by Hallas, son of Cirion the Steward.\n\nDuring the early days of the [[War of the Ring]], rumours were spread that the Rohirrim supplied Sauron's armies with horses. These rumours were obviously false: the Rohirrim valued their horses more than anything and would never send them away, even as tribute. Still, these rumours had some effect in that they obscured the fact it was Saruman who had fallen, rather than Rohan. The basis of the rumour was that Sauron's [[Orcs]] on raids into Rohan stole their horses for use in Mordor's army, but this was outright theft that angered the Rohirrim against Sauron.\n\n===Language===\n{{main|Rohanese}}\nThe Rohirrim spoke a language descended from that of the [[Éothéod]], related to the [[Northern Mannish]] of [[Rhovanion]]. In comparison to [[Westron]], it was mostly archaic and was not easily understood by the speakers of Westron.\n\nThe lords of the Rohirrim used [[Westron]] freely, in the gracious, noble and antique manner of the [[Gondorians]].<ref>{{App|Men}}</ref>\n\nThe Rohirrim wrote with a [[Mannish]] version of the [[cirth]], although they did not have a literature, preferring oral tradition.\n\n== Important Rohirrim ==\n*[[Kings of Rohan]]\n* [[Théodred]]\n* [[Éowyn]]\n* [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]]\n* [[Erkenbrand]]\n* [[Elfhelm]]\n* Various participants in the final wars\n\n==Etymology==\n''Rohirrim'' is a [[Sindarin]]<ref name=\"Eorl306\">{{UT|Eorl}}, p. 306</ref> name meaning \"Horse-lords\"<ref>{{App|Eorl}}, \"the Rohirrim (that is, the Horse-lords)\", p. 1063</ref> or \"the host of the Horse-lords\"<ref>{{L|144}}, p. 178</ref>.
