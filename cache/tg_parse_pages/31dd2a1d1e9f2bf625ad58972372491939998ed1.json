He was the father of [[Denethor]], the leader of the [[Green-elves]] who would later enter Beleriand and befriend [[Thingol]].\n\n== History ==\nThough [[Noldor]]in histories remember him as \"Lenwë\", his actual name was likely '''*Denwego''', or '''Denweg''' in the [[Nandorin]] language.<ref name=q&e_foot>{{WJ|Author}}</ref>{{rp|note 17}} He was a [[Teleri]] of the host of [[Olwë]].<ref>{{MR|P2g}}</ref>{{rp|§62}} \n\nDenweg journeyed with the Eldar until reaching the River [[Anduin]], where they established the settlement of [[Atyamar]]. Many of the Eldar enjoyed their life at Atyamar, as it was safe and rich in flowers and food. Though their chiefs urged them on, they were unwilling to leave. Eventually, the weather worsened and the winters become hard, and the chiefs gave an order to advance across the Anduin the following Spring; many among the Teleri, however, fought this. When the time came to cross, a great company under the leadership of Denweg, over 3,000 Eldar from the total population of about 28,000, refused and chose to remain at Atyamar. These folk became known as the Nandor.<ref>{{NM|March}}</ref>\n\nIt was said that many Nandor remained at Atyamar for thousands of years, though others migrated south down the Anduin and settled on the shores south of the [[White Mountains]], especially in later [[Belfalas]]. Others went on along the coasts until a number, including Denweg's son Denethor, came up into southeast Beleriand.<ref>{{NM|Foot}}</ref>{{rp|VII The March of the Quendi, fn2}}\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Lenwë'' is a [[Quenya]] word meaning \"leaving, departure\". It was derived from the ''✶ledmē'', which included the [[root]] ''LED'' (\"go\").<ref name=pe17>{{PE|17}}</ref>{{rp|51}} \n\n''Denwego'' probably meant \"lithe-and-active\" from ''✶dene-'' (\"thin and strong\", \"pliant\", \"lithe\")<ref name=q&e_foot>{{WJ|Author}}</ref>{{rp|note 17}} and ''WEG'' (\"live\", \"be active\").<ref name=pe17 />{{rp|190}}\n\n== Other names ==\nIn earlier versions of the legendarium the character was initially named '''''Dan'''''.<ref>{{SM|VN}}</ref>{{rp|note 14}} This became revised to '''''Dân''''' in the tongue of his people, but he was known as '''''Nano''''' otherwise.<ref>{{MR|P2g}}</ref>{{rp|§62}} The meanings of these names are not glossed.\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| LEN |LEN='''LENWË'''<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| |!| | |}}\n{{familytree| DEN |DEN=[[Denethor (son of Lenwë)|Denethor]]<br /><small>''d. {{YT|1497}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nIn ''[[The Later Annals of Valinor]]'', ''Dan'' was from a company of Noldoli (Noldor) who forsook the host of [[Finwë]] early in the Great Journey and turned south. These lands they found were dark and barren however, due to never having been visited by the [[Valar]] and the sky being scant in stars. After they turned back north, they then marched west with much wandering and grief. Of these people some under [Denithor >] Denethor eventually came to Beleriand. The people of Dan became known as the ''Danians''. This entry was a later addition to the annals, made by [[Pengolod]], as these it was not known to [[Rúmil]].<ref>{{LR|AV}}</ref><ref group=note>This was originally stated in ''[[The Earliest Annals of Valinor]]'', though with less details</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Lhammas]]'' the followers of Dan were briefly emended from Noldorin of the host of Finwë, to ''Lindarin'' ([[Vanyar]]in) of the host of [[Ingwë]].<ref>{{LR|Lhammas}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Annals of Aman]]'', ''Nano's'' people forsook the journey at the time of the crossing of the Anduin and the crossing of the Misty Mountains. Nano then led his people south down the river and passed out of knowledge of the Eldar. The year for this was 1115.<ref>{{MR|P2g}}</ref>{{rp|§62}}\n\nIn ''[[Quendi and Eldar]]'', his people explicitly rejected crossing the Misty Mountains.<ref>{{WJ|AC}}</ref>\n\n{{references|note}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lenwe}}\n\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n| name=Lenwë\n| race=nandor\n| house=\n| born=Between {{YT|1050}} and {{YT|1115|n}}\n| died=\n}}\n{{seq\n| prow=\n| pvac=None\n| prev=New position\n| list=Leader of the [[Nandor]]\n| dates={{YT|1115}} - unknown\n| next=Unknown\n| nvac=\n| nrow=\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Nandor]]\n[[Category:Nelyar]]\n[[Category:Quenya names]]\n[[Category:Rulers in Middle-earth]]\n[[de:Lenwe]]\n[[fi:Lenwë]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/elfes/teleri/nandor/lenwe]]"}}}
