Artaxerxes is described as an old man in ragged trousers wearing a green hat with a blue feather.<ref name=\"Roverandom\">{{HM|R}}</ref>{{rp|1}}\n\n== History ==\nOriginally from [[wikipedia:Persia|Persia]], Artaxerxes ended up in [[wikipedia:Pershore|Pershore]] by mistake.<ref name=\"Roverandom\"/>{{rp|14}}\n\nAfter Artaxerxes picks up [[Rover]]'s yellow ball, Rover demands it back without saying \"please\". Rover bites Artaxerxes trousers when he continues to refuse to return the ball; in retaliation, Artaxerxes turns Rover into a toy dog and transports Rover to a toy shop.<ref name=\"Roverandom\"/>{{rp|1–2}} Although Rover visits the [[Man-in-the-Moon]] with the help of [[Mew]], and seeks the help of the sand-sorcerer [[Psamathos Psamathides]], the great whale [[Uin]] takes Roverandom (as he is now known) to ask Artaxerxes to return him to being a normal dog.\n\nArtaxerxes is living at the bottom of the Deep Blue Sea and is married to the daughter of the Mer-king and has a white Mer-dog called Rover. As a wizard, he has been appointed Pacific and Atlantic Magician and is known as '''PAM'''. All the woes of the mer-people are blamed on PAM, including the emergence of a Sea-serpent. Because he is so deeply unpopular, Artaxerxes leaves with his wife and Roverandom: he takes Roverandom with him as the dog continues to be polite and show faith in his magical abilities.<ref name=\"Roverandom\"/>{{rp|55 ff}}\n\nBack on land, Artaxerxes turns Roverandom back into a real dog. Wearing a purple velvet suit, Artaxerxes sets up a chocolate and cigarette shop by the beach (selling [[wikipedia:Rock (confectionery)|Pam's Rock]]), whilst his wife gave swimming lessons.<ref name=\"Roverandom\"/>{{rp|83–7}}\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[wikipedia:Artaxerxes|Artaxerxes]] is the name of five Kings of Persia.\n\n[[Wayne G. Hammond|Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull|Scull]] note that the abbreviation for Pacific and Atlantic Magaician, PAM, is the same nickname that was given to former British Prime Minister [[wikipedia:Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerstone]].<ref name=\"Roverandom\"/>{{rp|109}}\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| | | | | MER |y| WIFE |MER=[[Mer-king]]<br/><small>''unknown''</small>|WIFE=''unnamed wife''<br/><small>''unknown''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | |!| |}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | |!| |}}\n{{familytree| | | ART |~| MRS |ART='''ARTAXERXES'''<br/><small>''unknown''</small>|MRS=[[Mrs. Artaxerxes]]<br/><small>''unknown''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Roverandom]]\n\n[[fi:Artakserkses]]"}}}
