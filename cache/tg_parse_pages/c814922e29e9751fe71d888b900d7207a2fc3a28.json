The house had a fenced arbour which lay slightly below it near the steep east bank of the [[Anduin]]. At the central point of Borlas's garden was a tree which Borlas called [[Neldor]]. Sometime during Borlas's life, Pen-arduin started being used in connection with his name: Borlas of Pen-arduin.<ref name=\"House\">{{PM|Shadow}}, pp. 411-2, 415, 418</ref>\n\nOne day, when Borlas cought a youth named [[Saelon]] stealing an unripe apple from the orchard, he brought the boy inside Pen-arduin, explaining to him that stealing unripe fruit solely to play with before tossing it aside was \"[[Orcs]]' work\". While Saelon eventually grew out of petty thievery, he harbored thoughts of revenge and sometimes thought about cutting down all of the trees in Pen-arduin, but never went though with the thought.<ref name=\"House\"/>\n\nSometime during the month of [[June]] in the year {{FoA|103}}, Borlas was trimming a whistle of green willow with a sharp nail-knife at the arbour of Pen-arduin in the late afternoon. During which, Saelon came upon him and they began having a discussion about the nature of evil. Soon afterwards, Borlas talked rhetorically to his tree, [[Neldor]], before deciding to go inside his house.<ref name=\"House\"/>\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Pen-arduin'' appears to be a [[Sindarin]] name. Its meaning is not glossed, but Paul Strack and David Salo suggest a combination of ''[[pend]]'' (\"fall\"), ''[[ar|ar(a)-]]'' (\"royal\"), and ''[[duin]]'' (\"river\").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-3563324827.html|articlename=S.
