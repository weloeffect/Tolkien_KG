It is borrowed from the Italian ''scimitarra'' which was likely borrowed, by uncertain origin, from the Persian ''šamšer'' (\"sword, scimitar\").<ref>{{Cite web|articleurl=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/scimitar#h1|articlename=Scimitar|accessed=10 December 2024}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:Lurtz Scimitar.png|thumb|The Orc Lurtz carrying an \"Uruk-Hai scimitar\" in [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'']]|344x344px]]'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'''''\n:The \"Orc Scimitar\" and \"Goblin Scimitar\" cards were included in [[The Fellowship of the Ring (Decipher)|''The Fellowship of the Ring'']] base set of the card game.\n\n'''2001: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'']]'''\n:In [[Peter Jackson]]'s film series, the [[Uruk-hai]] of [[Saruman]] carry swords described in merchandise as \"Uruk-hai scimitars\". This blade-type is notably carried by the Orc [[Lurtz]]. However, \"scimitar\" is a misnomer given that it is a straight blade with a spike at the end, and neither of these features are characteristic of historical scimitars.\n'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'']]'''\n\n:The Uruk-hai of Saruman are shown wielding the straight-bladed \"Uruk-hai scimitar\" throughout the film.\n\n'''2003: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'']]'''\n\n:Swords closely resembling historical scimitars are clearly seen being used among the [[Orcs of Mordor]], specifically when [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] and [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] disguise themselves as Orcs in [[Mordor]]. The costumes of the [[Corsairs of Umbar]] include curved swords, but they are not clearly visible in the film.\n\n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'''''\n\n:The \"Isengard Scimitar\" card was included in the ''Battle of Helms Deep'' set of the card game.\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'''''\n\n:The \"Corsair Scimitar\" card was included in the ''Treachery and Deceit'' set of the card game.\n\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:Weapons]]\n[[Category:Swords]]"}}}
