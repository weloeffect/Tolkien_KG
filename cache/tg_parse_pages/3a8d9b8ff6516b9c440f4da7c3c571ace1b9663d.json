Scattered shafts of sunlight soon ceased and the passage became as dark as a tunnel. In the late Third Age cobwebs entangled tree-branches on either side but none impeded the path. Roughly halfway through the forest the Elf-path was cut by the [[Enchanted River]]. This was 12 yards wide but a boat was permanently tied there to act as a ferry. Four days march beyond the enchanted stream the Elf-path entered an area where the dominant trees were slender beeches so the light was less dim. After a further two days march the Elf-path sloped downward into a valley of mighty oaks.<ref name=Flies>{{H|Flies}}</ref>\n\nThe Elf-path led to the Elvenking's Halls, presumably to the bridge across the [[Forest River]] that led to the gates of the underground halls.<ref name=Wilderland/> It then continued to the eastern edge of the forest,<ref name=Welcome/> presumably along the Forest River, to the Long Marshes.<ref name=Queer/> By {{TA|2941}}<ref name=TA2941>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2941, p. 1089</ref> marshes and bogs had spread on either side of the Forest River and the Elf-path now stopped at a doubtful and little-used end at the eastern edge of the forest.<ref name=Welcome/>\n\n==History==\nIn {{TA|2941}}<ref name=TA2941/> [[Bilbo Baggins]], [[Thorin]], and [[Thorin and Company|the company]] of dwarves passed through the Forest Gate and found their surroundings to be still, dark and stuffy.<ref name=Flies/>\n\nThe dwarves may have failed in the quest when they came upon the Enchanted River. Thankfully, Bilbo's keen eyes spied the boat on the river's eastern eastern bank. With Bilbo's help, [[Fíli]] hooked the boat with a rope and the party could move on, but not before [[Bombur]] had fallen in and fallen into a sleep that lasted for many days.<ref name=Flies/>\n\nLater the party heard distant singing and laughter. Bilbo climbed one of the trees to see if the end of the path could be spotted but, unaware that his tree was at the bottom of the valley, reported to the dwarves that no end was in sight.<ref name=Flies/>\n\nThe next day, with no food left, the party saw lights off in the forest and left the Elf-path to try to obtain something to eat.  When they scrambled into the ring of feasting [[Nandor|Wood-elves]] all the lights went out as if by magic. The party was lost, and they never returned to the Elf-path.<ref name=Flies/> Instead the dwarves were taken captive by [[Wood-elves]] and taken blindfolded to the Elvenking's Halls. Bilbo managed to escape detection and capture by putting on his magic [[The One Ring|ring]], which turned him invisible and allowed him to follow the Wood-elves into the Elvenking's Halls.<ref>{{H|Barrels}}</ref>\n\nNews of this had come to [[Gandalf]], and he hurried to finish his other business and search for Thorin's company.<ref name=Welcome/>\n\n{{references}}\n{{companyroute}}\n[[Category:Rhovanion]]\n[[Category:Roads and streets]]\n[[de:Elbenweg]]\n[[fi:Haltiapolku]]"}}}
