His mother was their matriarch until her death in war, after which his sister became queen. As the queen’s brother, Hoarmûrath held a high position within his society.\n\nHis close relationship with the [[Avari]] of the south, who taught him magic and power, put him at odds with Urd traditions. When he proposed to wage war for territory, his sister instead ordered him exiled. A struggle ensued, and Hoarmûrath's retainers slew his sister. To avoid punishment, he declared himself the first King of Urd. With the aid of the Avari, he crushed all opposition and became the Lord of the Urdar in {{SA|1992}}.\n\nHoarmûrath expanded his dominion rapidly, , ruling much of the land between the Northern Seas, but his alliance with the Avari soured when he coveted their immortality and wealth. In {{SA|1999}}, he turned on them, but the Avari were victorious in two great battles. In desperation, Hoarmûrath sought help from [[Sauron]]. The Dark Lord sent [[Khamûl]] with a [[Nine Rings|Ring of Power]]. In {{SA|2000}}, Hoarmûrath accepted and became the sixth King to fall under Sauron's sway.\n\nInvigorated by his Ring, Hoarmûrath led a renewed and successful campaign against the Avari. He styled himself as the Lord of the North and ruled as a client-king for Sauron for over two hundred years. In {{SA|2250}}, having secured his kingdom and his succession, he was summoned to Mordor by Sauron to help prepare to counter the growing might of [[Númenor]]. For the next thousand years, he oversaw the construction of defences around Udûn, including the Gates of Mordor, though he still visited his own kingdom.\n\nHe fled back to Urd after Númenor's invasion in {{SA|3261}} but returned to Mordor after the [[Downfall of Númenor|Downfall]]. He led campaigns in Rhovanion and commanded the northern flank in the invasion of Ithilien. He passed into shadows as Sauron was overthrown in the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. \n\nHoarmûrath reappeared around {{TA|1050}}, and by {{TA|1640}} had rebuilt his kingdom. He joined the other Nazgûl in Mordor and made his lair in the abandoned castle of [[Durthang]]. He later participated in the capture of [[Minas Morgul|Minas Ithil]] in {{TA|2002}}.\n\nDuring the [[War of the Ring]], he rode with the Black Riders in search of the [[The One Ring|One Ring]]. He was one of the Ringwraiths who fought in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields|Battle of Pelennor Fields]], later joining the remaining wraiths at the [[Battle of the Morannon]], where he perished with Sauron's defeat.<ref name=ICE/>\n==Weaponry in Middle-earth Role Playing==\nBeyond a [[Morgul-knife]], the Ringwraith is noted to have possessed the following weapons:\n*'''Snow Hammer''': A war mattock made of clear [[Stones_in_Middle-earth_Role_Playing#Laen|laen]], inlaid with drake-horn.<ref>{{ICE|2010}},  p. 44</ref>\n* '''Hue Changer''': A [[Woods_in_Middle-earth_Role_Playing#Dírwood|dírwooden]] spear which can change colour.<ref>{{ICE|2010}},  p. 34</ref>\n{{References}}\n{{Nazgûl in adaptations}} \n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nazgûl 6}}\n[[Category:Undead from adaptations]]\n[[Category:Middle-earth Role Playing characters]]"}}}
