I must thank you warmly for your interest and attention. At present the tape of songs is silent, I fear: I have no machine for playing it. Also after a period of severe troubles, and personal illness, I am more than short of time, and behind with various contracts. I am also to add to my difficulties at present without a secretary. Owing to my wife's ill health I am obliged shortly to leave home for some time in search of less damp and more warmth. I shall not be here (as above) after June 22 for some time, but the above address will find me eventually. Yours sincerely, JRR Tolkien.''<ref>{{webcite|author=Jennifer Berry, [[Anders Stenström|Beregond, Anders Stenström]] |articleurl=http://www.facebook.com/groups/TheTolkienSociety.EducationalCharity/posts/10159272537526068/|articlename=(Tolkien Society Facebook group post)|dated=30 September 2021|website=FB|accessed=9 October 2021}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Letter to George Sayer (24 June 1953)]] (also dealing with a tape machine)\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.sueparman.com/blog/posts/39600 Montaigne's Tower: For Beregond, who asked] (Sue Parman presenting the letter)\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Letters|Parman, Sue]]"}}}
