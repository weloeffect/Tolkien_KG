It is similar to the English word \"will\" and carried similar meanings to \"free will\", \"willpower\", \"intention\", \"purpose\" and so on.\n\nIn one sense, indo referred to as the \"innermost self\" of a rational creature (i.e. [[Ainur]] and [[Incarnate]]s) and was taken as referring to the centre of “reason”. This could be translated as \"heart\" in the metaphorical sense,<ref name=\"pe17\">{{PE|17}}</ref>{{rp|155}} though the more direct Quenya word for metaphorical heart was ''[[hondo]]'' which itself was probably influenced by ''*indō''.<ref>{{NM|Gender}}</ref> \n\nIn another sense, indo referred to the purposing faculty of the [[fëa]]r of rational beings;<ref name=\"pe22\">{{PE|22}}</ref> their \"free will\" encompassing decisions and efforts directed towards a fully aware purpose. For example, if an individual set out on a journey with a specific intent, that would be be considered an exercise of their free will; the specific path taken (such as avoiding a marsh or how they crossed a stream) was considered intuitive or half-conscious, as that of an [[kelvar|irrational animal]].<ref name=\"fate\">{{NM|Fate}}</ref> It was through this free will that a rational being was able to use, or not use, the \"chances\" that were presented to them by ''[[umbar (word)|umbar]]'' (\"fate\").<ref name=\"fate\" /> Another Quenya word which shares this meaning is ''lēle''.<ref name=\"fate\" />\n\nIn a related sense, indo was also used to refer to \"resolve\": the fully conscious purpose to an accomplishment of which a rational being could apply itself with vigour of mind and body.<ref name=\"pe22\" /> In this regard, after ''[[sanwë]]'' (thought), and ''nāmie'' (a judgment or desire), indo was the determination to carry through the subsequent actions.<ref name=\"ore\">{{NM|Ore}}</ref> More specifically, this sense of indo could be referred to by the derived term ''indonen''.<ref name=\"pe22\" />\n\nIn a similar sense, it further referred to the movement or activity of the fëar, and could be exhibited in the character, mood, or personality of a being. This sense could be more specifically referred to by the derived term ''indóme''.<ref name=\"pe22\" />\n\nIndo also included one's state-of-mind, or mood. The natural, or simple, state was \"openness\" (as in receptive to the minds of others) when not otherwise occupied with thinking or being turned towards Eru.<ref name=\"osanwe\">{{NM|Osanwe}}</ref>\n\nWhile indo could be used as a synecdoche for the \"mind\" as a whole,<ref name=\"pe17\"/>{{rp|189}} it was distinct from ''[[sanar]]'' (the faculty of \"thought\"), and ''[[órë]]'' (the faculty of \"moral impulse\" or \"premonition\").<ref name=\"ore\">{{NM|Ore}}</ref> Like sanar and órë, indo was considered a faculty of the [[fëa]], rather than of the [[hröa]].<ref name=\"pe17\">{{PE|17}}</ref>{{rp|189}}\n\n==Etymology==\n''Indo'' may have derived from the [[Primitive Quendian]] word '''inidō''',<ref name=\"pe22\"/>{{rp|165}} a compound of ''IN'' (\"mind\", \"inner self\") + ''[[NID]]'' (\"force\", \"thrust\", \"pressure\" (in a given direction)) + ''-ō'' (genitive suffix).\n\nIt may also have derived from ''*im-do'' (\"self, innermost being\"; taken as referring to the centre of 'reason').<ref>{{NM|Gender}}</ref>\n\n==Derivations==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto\"\n|+Derivations\n!Word!!Meaning!!Affix\n|-\n|''indóme''||Settled character; also used for the \"will\" of Eru<ref name=\"pe17\"/>{{rp|189}}||''-më'' (abstract noun)\n|-\n|''indonen''||\"By the will\"<ref name=\"pe22\"/>{{rp|165}}||''-nen'' (instrumental)\n|-\n|''indor''||Wills<ref>{{NM|Spirit}}</ref><ref group=note>[[Carl F.

See the [[NID]] article for details.\n\n==Other versions==\n===History===\nIn [[Qenya]], the word ''indo'' originally had nothing to do with \"mind\", and meant \"house\".<ref>{{HM|LT1}} p.343</ref>\n\nThe meaning next shifted to \"heart, mood\", being derived from ''IN'' (\"mind\") + ''ID'' (\"heart, desire, wish\").<ref>{{LR|P3}}</ref>\n\nWith the introduction of ''órë'' (\"heart (inner mind)\"), ''indo'' took the broader role of \"mind\" through emendations from ''īn'' >  ''inno'' > ''indo''.<ref>{{MR|P3II3a}}</ref> \n\nIt then became a synecdoche with the definition of \"mind, region/range of thought, mood\"; i.e. used either for \"mind\" as a whole, or for the specific faculties ''of'' the mind such as \"thought\" and \"mood\".<ref name=\"pe17\"/>{{rp|189}}\n\nWith the introduction of the ''sanar'', which itself became a synecdoche of both \"mind\" and the mind's faculty of thought, ''indo'' narrowed to \"will\" (as in resolve or determination), or the internal driving force; it was then given the etymology based on NID.\n\n===Lēle===\nIn a note dated c. 1968, Tolkien considered using ''lēle'' as a Quenya word representing \"will\". It was defined as \"to will with conscious purpose, immediate or remote\" and possibly derived from the [[Sundocarme|root]] ''*[[DEL]]'',<ref name=\"fate\" /> which meant \"walk, go, proceed\".<ref>{{WJ|B}}</ref> The verbal forms were ''lelya'' (''lelinye'').\n\nHowever, at some point between Jan. 12 1968 and Oct. 9 1969, Tolkien returned to the use of \"indo\" to represent the concept of will.<ref name=\"pe22\"/>{{rp|144}}\n\n{{references|note}}\n{{title|lowercase}}\n[[Category:Quenya nouns]]\n[[Category:Metaphysics]]"}}}
