They find a raised boulder for what they believe will be their final respite. Frodo, no longer weighed down with the burden of the [[The One Ring|Ring]], exclaims ''\"It's done\"''. He lays down, with a sea of molten lava surrounding them, and closes his eyes. ''\"I can see [[The Shire]]\"'', he says. Sam looks on, and reminisces about the life he could have had, had he not left The Shire with Frodo on the quest that led them to [[Mordor]]. He speaks of [[Rosie Cotton]], and weeps as he says ''\"If ever I was to marry someone... it would have been her.\"'' Frodo gets up, wraps an arm around Sam's shoulder, and says ''\"I'm glad to be with you Samwise Gamgee. Here at the end of all things\"''. The screen fades to black for a few seconds. \n\nAs Frodo and Sam lie on a large boulder awaiting death in the fiery cataclysm, Gandalf, upon [[Gwaihir]], flies towards them, with two other eagles. The eagles take Frodo and Sam from the large rock. A dazed Frodo looks around before his eyes slowly close. \n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King scenes|72]]"}}}
