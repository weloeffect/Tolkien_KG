He also said that messengers had spoken to King Brand and that he was afraid, for war appeared to be gathering on his eastern borders.<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref>\n\nKing Brand remained steadfast though.  In {{TA|3019|}} when a host of [[Sauron]]'s allies crossed the River [[Carnen]] he retreated into [[Dale]].  There the [[Men of Dale]] and the [[Dwarves of Erebor]] fought for three days.  Brand was slain at the side of [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin II Ironfoot]] during the [[Battle of Dale]], at the end of which the victorious [[Easterlings]] drove the allies (including his son, Bard) into [[Erebor]] where they were besieged. \n\nHowever, when news of Sauron's defeat came his northern army was dismayed with his son (and Dáin's son, [[Thorin III|Thorin]]) breaking the siege.  King Brand was succeeded by his son, [[Bard II]].<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n[[J.R.R.

Unlike in the books, Brand is depicted being slain by arrows in the crossing of the [[River Running]] while guarding his people's retreat to the Mountain. This inconsistency is referenced in a later quest in which a notorious dwarf tale-spinner describes events unfolding this way, and the player has the option to agree with the veracity of his tale or to disagree in favour of the canonical version of Brand's death.\n\n{{references}}\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n| race=northmen\n| died=[[17 March]] {{TA|3019}}}}\n{{seq\n| prev=[[Bain]]\n| list=3rd [[King of Dale]]\n| dates={{TA|3007}} – [[17 March]] {{TA|3019|n}}\n| next=[[Bard II]]\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n\n[[Category:Bardings]]\n[[Category:Germanic names]]\n[[Category:Kings of Dale]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[de:Brand]]\n[[fi:Brand]]\n[[fr:encyclo:personnages:hommes:3a:hommes du nord:daliens:brand]]"}}}
