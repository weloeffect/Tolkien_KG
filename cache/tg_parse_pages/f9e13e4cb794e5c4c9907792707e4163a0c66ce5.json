In return, Eärendel gave Ing ''[[limpë]]'', a drink that turned him immortal.<ref group=\"note\">In another outline, it was the Elves living in Luthany who gave Ing ''limpë'', with Eärendel coming to Luthany after the invasion of the [[Rúmhoth]] has already taken place.</ref> He also blessed Ing's progeny, and told him of [[Tol Eressëa]], an island to which the Elves of Luthany go to, kindling Ing's desire to sail there. Presumably due to this, Ing and many of his people embarked on a voyage to Tol Eressëa - however, due to Ossë's wrath at Ing's helping of Eärendel, they were caught up in a storm and blown eastwards, with Ing being the only survivor.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outlines '''23''' and '''24''', p. 306</ref>\n\nIn response to the departure of Ing, and in fear of an invasion by evil Men, the Elves of Luthany cut a [[wikipedia:English channel|channel]] that separated Luthany from the rest of the Great Lands, making it an island.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''26''', p. 307</ref>\n\nThe island of Luthany suffered seven invasions in its history after the arrival of the Elves, each one worse for the Elves than the last one. The penultimate invasion was that of the [[Rúmhoth]] (also known as the [[wikipedia:Romans|Romans]]) who did not even believe that the Elves were real, prompting the departure of nearly every elf left on the island.<ref name=\"Lut\"/>\n\n=== England's origins ===\nAfter 300 years<ref name=\"Lut\"/> however the [[Ingwaiwar]] (people of Ing) invaded and were friendly to the Elves due to the teachings of Ing - and because of this, what little was left of the Elves on the island temporarily slowed down their exodus to Tol Eressëa, many of whom learned [[Old English]], the language of the Ingwaiwar, during that time.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outlines '''19''' and '''20''', p. 304</ref>\n\nSome time after, a mariner called [[Ælfwine]], a descendant of Ing, was born in Luthany. He would later manage to find a way to Tol Eressëa, and learn the histories of the Elves. In one of the outlines of the ''Book of Lost Tales'', Ælfwine was the author of the ''[[Parma Kuluina|Golden Book of Tavrobel]]''.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''30''', p. 310</ref>\n\nAccording to another outline, it was prophesied by the Elves that Ing would eventually lead them from Tol Eressëa back to Luthany<ref name=\"Lut\">{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''22''', pp. 305-6</ref> in the [[Second Faring Forth]].<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''27''', p. 307</ref>\n\n== Description ==\nMany of the places in Tol Eressëa, such as [[Kortirion]] or [[Tavrobel]] (the New), were named after older places in Luthany (such as [[Kortirion the Old]] or [[Tavrobel the Old]]).<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outlines '''29''' and '''30''', p. 310</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''Luthany'' is in [[Gnomish]],<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3982558599.html|articlename=G.
