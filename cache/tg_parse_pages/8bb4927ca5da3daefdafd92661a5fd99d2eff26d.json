The Elves built their cities and strongholds across the land and they were strengthened by the coming of [[Edain|Men]] to Beleriand.<ref>{{S|17}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Prelude===\nIn {{FA|422}}<ref>{{GA|133}}</ref> [[Fingolfin]] considered a new assault upon [[Angband]], as Morgoth had been contained rather than wholly defeated, and the threat of new dangers devised by him was present in Fingolfin's mind. [[Angrod]] and [[Aegnor]] were like-minded, but most of the Noldor, especially the [[Sons of Fëanor]], were content with the present peaceful state of affairs and were reluctant to pay the deadly cost such an attack would incur. Thus, no attack was made, and Morgoth was left alone to continue secretly building his strength until his preparations were completed in {{FA|455}}.<ref name=\"Ruin\">{{S|18}}</ref>\n\n===Battle===\nOn a winter's night, Morgoth sent out rivers of flame from [[Thangorodrim]], and the [[Iron Mountains|Mountains of Iron]] spewed fires and deadly fumes. The flames consumed the plain of [[Ard-galen]], which was renamed [[Anfauglith]]. Many Elves perished as they tried to escape the fire, and the confusion caused by the flame and smoke hindered the defenders that watched Angband. Then Morgoth sent forth his armies, led by [[Glaurung]], first of the [[Urulóki]]. Behind Glaurung came [[Balrogs]] and multitudes of [[Orcs]], and they slaughtered anyone they came across.<ref name=\"Ruin\" />\n\n[[File:Elena Kukanova - Dagor Bragollach.jpg|200px|thumb|left|''Dagor Bragollach'' by [[Elena Kukanova]]]]\nThe highlands of [[Dorthonion]] bore much of the assault and were overrun. [[Angrod]] and [[Aegnor]] were slain, and many of [[House of Bëor|Bëor's folk]] fell, including their lord [[Bregolas]]. King [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] came north from [[Nargothrond]] with an army, but Finrod with a small company was surrounded at the [[Fen of Serech]] and cut off from his people. Finrod would have been killed or captured, but was saved by [[Barahir]] and his [[XII Bëorings|twelve followers]], who was fighting in western [[Dorthonion]] near the [[Pass of Sirion]]. They managed to cut through with great loss and Finrod and his folk came back to Nargothrond, while Barahir continued defending Dorthonion. It was this deed that later earned Barahir the ring of Finrod, which would become known as the [[Ring of Barahir]], along with a vow of abiding friendship.<ref name=\"Ruin\" />\n\nIn the north-west [[Fingolfin]] and [[Fingon]] marched with their host to aid the sons of Finarfin, but they were driven back to the fortresses in the [[Ered Wethrin|mountains]]. [[Hador]], the [[lord of Dor-lómin]], and his younger son [[Gundor]] were slain defending the rearguard of Fingolfin. In the mountain fortresses there was a fierce battle between Morgoth's forces and the Elves and [[House of Hador|Men of the North]]. Hithlum was successfully defended against the Orcs and Balrogs, but Fingolfin became separated from his people during the battle.<ref name=\"Ruin\" />\n\nThe [[March of Maedhros]] was assaulted heavily by the armies of Morgoth. With great loss, the hosts of Morgoth [[Battle of the Pass of Aglon|forced]] the [[Pass of Aglon]], and [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]] fled with their people to Nargothrond. [[Maedhros]] was later able to reclose the Pass, but the horsemen of the people of [[Fëanor]] were overwhelmed on the plain of [[Lothlann]] and [[Maglor's Gap]] was taken. Glaurung came there and burned the land between the arms of [[Gelion]]. With the gap taken, the Orcs moved south and captured [[Caranthir]]'s fortress in [[Mount Rerir]]. [[Thargelion]] was ravaged and [[Lake Helevorn]] defiled. The Orcs then crossed over Gelion into [[East Beleriand]]. Maglor fled to join Maedhros at Himring while Caranthir fled south with Amrod and Amras to [[Amon Ereb]], which they defended with the help of the [[Green-elves]], and the Orcs did not come into Taur-im-Duinath or Ossiriand. Maedhros fought valiantly against the Orcs with the help of Maglor and the people of Dorthonion and the east marches, preventing Morgoth from taking the fortress on [[Himring]].<ref name=\"Ruin\" />\n\nWar did not completely cease in Beleriand afterwards, but the Battle was considered to have ended with the lessening of Morgoth's onslaught at the coming of spring.<ref name=\"Ruin\" />\n\n===Aftermath===\nThus the Siege of Angband was broken, and the forces of Morgoth were able to roam at will throughout the north. His enemies were decimated, and most of the [[Grey-elves]] fled south to [[Doriath]], [[Nargothrond]], [[Falas]] and [[Ossiriand]]. However, Morgoth could not completely destroy his foes as they scattered and hid in secret places, and he had himself been wounded.<ref name=\"Ruin\" />\n\nMorgoth's power extended over the [[Northlands]], but a few folk of [[Barahir]] remained, fighting determinedly for their lands and refusing to retreat from the attacking forces. Morgoth relentlessly sought to kill them until very few remained. So great was his wrath against them that Dorthonion was turned into a twisted land of dread, renamed [[Taur-nu-Fuin]], and it was filled with such dark enchantment that even Orcs would not enter it unless need drove them. The women and children of Barahir's folk at last fled to [[Brethil]], some joining the [[Haladin]] there, and others continuing to [[Dor-lómin]] and joining the [[House of Hador|people]] of [[Galdor]]. The remaining men lived as outlaws in Dorthonion, until all were slain save [[Beren]].<ref name=\"Ruin\" />\n\nThe sons of Fëanor were scattered and driven from their lands, except for Maedhros, who still held Himring. Celegorm and Curufin travelled to Nargothrond after [[Battle of the Pass of Aglon|being defeated]] in the [[Pass of Aglon]]. For a time, the Noldor defended the [[Pass of Sirion]] and [[Minas Tirith (Beleriand)|Minas Tirith]], but after the fall of Fingolfin, Sauron came and took Minas Tirith for Morgoth, turning it into a place of evil known as [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]]. Using this pass, the servants of Morgoth came farther into Beleriand and surrounded Doriath. Yet Nargothrond and Gondolin remained hidden from Morgoth, and as the Elves began to recover their losses, southern Beleriand had peace for a time.<ref name=\"Ruin\" />\n\n===The fall of Fingolfin===\n{{Main|Fall of Fingolfin}}\n[[File:Kimberly - Fingolfin sketch.jpeg|thumb|''Fingolfin's Wrath'' by [[:Category:Images by Kimberly|Kimberly]]]]\nAfter a year of fighting,<ref>{{GA|155}}</ref> when [[Fingolfin]], the [[High King of the Noldor]], saw what he believed to be the utter ruin of the Noldor, he rode in anger across the dust of Anfauglith and challenged Morgoth to single combat. At the doors of [[Angband]] itself they fought a great duel. Fingolfin's sword, [[Ringil]], wounded Morgoth seven times. Yet he was felled by Morgoth's hammer, [[Grond (Hammer of the Underworld)|Grond]], and crushed by Morgoth's mighty foot. Fingolfin's body was saved by [[Thorondor]] King of Eagles and brought into the mountaintops north of [[Gondolin]]. There [[Turgon]] his son built a [[Fingolfin's Cairn|cairn]] over his body.<ref name=\"Ruin\" />\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Dagor Bragollach.mp3|Ardamir}}\n''Dagor Bragollach'' is [[Sindarin]] for \"Battle of Sudden Flame\".<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> It contains the elements ''[[dagor]]'' (\"battle\") + ''[[bragol]]'' (\"quick, sudden\") + ''[[lach]]'' (\"flame\").\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nThe earliest concept of the battle appears in the unfinished poem ''[[The Lay of Leithian]]''. Although the account is brief, some elements of it remain in later writings such as [[Barahir]] saving Felagund and the deaths of [[Angrod]] and [[Egnor]] (Aegnor).<ref>{{LB|C6}}</ref> In the ''[[Sketch of the Mythology]]'' where Tolkien started to piece together the legends, the battle appears briefly once more. However, Christopher commented that the new material that appears in later writings may have already been in the mind of his father when he wrote the ''Sketch''.<ref>{{SM|2a}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Quenta Noldorinwa]]'' there is a huge expansion of material in this version compared to the ''Sketch'', of which many elements appear in ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.<ref name=\"QNINE\">{{SM|Q9}}</ref> It was originally labelled as the second battle, but was later changed to the third battle in the [[Wars of Beleriand]], partly due to the inclusion of the [[Dagor Aglareb]] as the second battle.<ref>{{SM|CQ9}}</ref>\n\nThe naming of the battle went through many revisions in the writing. The battle was not named in early writings until the ''[[Quenta Noldorinwa]]'', where it is called the '''Battle of Sudden Flame'''.<ref name=\"QNINE\" /> It was later changed to '''Battle of Sudden Fire'''<ref>{{SM|7I}}</ref> and for the first time given an Elvish name, '''Dagor Hurbreged''',<ref>{{SM|7In}}</ref> then changed to '''Dagor Húr-Breged'''.<ref>{{LR|AB}}</ref> The battle was referred to as '''Dagor Vreged-úr''' in the ''[[Quenta Silmarillion (Lost Road)|Quenta Silmarillion]]''.<ref>{{LR|P2VI}}</ref> In the latest versions it takes its final form '''Dagor Bragollach''', '''Battle of Sudden Flame'''.<ref name=\"GADB\" /><ref>{{WJ|15}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Images of Dagor Bragollach|Images of the Dagor Bragollach]]\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{warsofbeleriand}}\n\n[[Category:Pronounced articles]]\n[[Category:Conflicts of the First Age]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n[[de:Dagor Bragollach]]\n[[fr:encyclo:evenements:1a:guerres:dagor bragollach]]\n[[fi:Dagor Bragollach]]"}}}
