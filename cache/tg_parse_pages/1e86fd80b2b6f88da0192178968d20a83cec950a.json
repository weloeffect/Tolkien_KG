The 2020 seminar sought to explore how J.R.R. Tolkien’s legacy partly relies on the continued adaptation of his works, characters, and languages. It offered insights into a range of artistic adaptations and evaluated how the tangible result expands the Tolkien fanbase and readership while cultivating a love and appreciation of Tolkien through the adaptor’s creative vision. It further examined the ways in which Tolkien’s creations have been interwoven into the very fabric of our primary world.}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.tolkiensociety.org/store/adapting-tolkien/ Official webpage]\n\n{{peterroe}}\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Publications by the Tolkien Society]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]"}}}
