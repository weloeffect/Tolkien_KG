A power that walked the earth, ere elf sang or hammer rang.|[[Gandalf]] to [[Théoden]] in ''[[The Two Towers]]'', \"[[The Road to Isengard]]\"}}\n\n'''Treebeard''', also known as '''Fangorn''', was the oldest of the [[Ents]], a tree-like being who was a sort of \"shepherd of trees\". Very tall and stiff-limbed, with bark-like skin and leafy hair, like most Ents, Treebeard took a long time to make up his mind. He repeatedly spoke of not \"being hasty\". \n\nTreebeard is described along with [[Tom Bombadil]] as the [[eldest|oldest being]] in Middle-earth. By the later [[Third Age]], he lived in [[Fangorn Forest]], which was named after him.\n\n== History ==\nTreebeard was the [[eldest]] living being of [[Middle-earth]], having been awakened along with the Ents during the [[Years of the Trees]] of the [[First Age]], sometime after the [[Awakening of the Elves|Awakening]] of the [[Elves]], who taught the Ents to speak language in the first place;<ref name=Treebeard/>{{rp|468}} although he said that there were trees in Fangorn that were \"older than he\". His realm was the immense forest that spanned from [[Beleriand]] and [[Eriador]] to [[Calenardhon]] and saw it destroyed and diminishing by the centuries. From the [[Elder Days]], Treebeard had memories of the [[Willows|willow]]-meads of [[Tasarinan]], the [[Elms|elm]]-woods of [[Ossiriand]], the [[Pines|pine]]-trees of [[Dorthonion]] and the [[beeches]] of [[Forest of Neldoreth|Neldoreth]].<ref>{{TT|III4}}, \"[[In the Willow-meads of Tasarinan]]\"</ref> \n[[File:Luca Bonatti - Farewell to Fangorn.jpg|200px|left|thumb|''Farewell to Fangorn'' by [[:Category:Images by Luca Bonatti|Luca Bonatti]]]]\nHe was with his beloved [[Fimbrethil]], but as with all of the other [[Entwives]], she left for the [[Brown Lands|gardens of the Entwives]], and had been missing ever since, especially after [[Sauron]]'s forces destroyed those lands in the [[Second Age]]. \n\nThe forests of the Ents diminished and [[Fangorn Forest]] was one of their remnants, where Treebeard and other Ents retreated. There he kept his [[Ent-houses]] one of which was the [[Wellinghall]] in the flanks of [[Methedras]].<ref name=\"Treebeard\">{{TT|III4}}</ref> \n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Treebeard and the Entmoot.jpg|200px|thumb|''Treebeard and the Entmoot'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nDuring the [[War of the Ring]], in [[29 February]] {{TA|3019}} he discovered [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] (\"Merry\") and [[Peregrin Took]] (\"Pippin\") after they escaped from [[Orcs]]. He welcomed them to the [[Wellinghall]]. The hobbits brought news of the Wizard Saruman's treachery and [[Orcs of Isengard|his Orcs]] damaging the trees, but Treebeard already knew of these disasters.\n\nThe Ents—usually a very patient, deliberate people—did become angry at Saruman, whose forces were cutting down large numbers of their trees. Treebeard convened an [[Entmoot]], a meeting of the Ents at [[Derndingle]].<ref name=\"Treebeard\"/>\n\nAfter lengthy deliberation Treebeard led them marching on Saruman's fortress at Isengard in [[March 3]], accompanied by the two Hobbits: the last march of the Ents. In the [[Battle of Isengard]] they destroyed the valley and trapped Saruman in the tower of Orthanc. Treebeard appointed the two Hobbits door-wardens of Orthanc. There Treebeard also saw [[Gríma|Wormtongue]] who brought a message for Saruman, and caught him and captured him inside Orthanc.<ref>{{TT|III8}}</ref>\n\n[[5 March|Two days later]] they were soon joined by a company of [[Rohirrim]] with [[Gandalf]], returning victorious from the [[Battle of the Hornburg]]. After deposing Saruman, Gandalf asked Treebeard to pour back the water into Orthanc so that Saruman can never escape. Treebeard declared that trees would return and that the new forest would be called the \"Watchwood\".<ref>{{TT|III9}}</ref>\n\nThe following months the Ents destroyed the [[Ring of Isengard]], filling it with trees; Treebeard saw the flight of many Orcs who met their doom in the forest. He kept their prisoner informed, who would come to the window of Orthanc to listen. \n\nEventually the Wizard withered away and eventually managed to make the Ents pity him, and on [[August 15]] they let them leave Isengard. However, before he left, Treebeard made him lock the tower and hand over the [[key of Orthanc]]. [[August 22|A week later]] Treebeard welcomed [[Gandalf]], [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] and company at Orthanc, and related these news.\n\nPresumably Treebeard stayed for some time in the [[Treegarth of Orthanc]], which King Elessar declared an Entish realm.<ref>{{RK|Partings}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{Pronounce|Fangorn.mp3|Ardamir}}\nTreebeard is the direct translation of the [[Sindarin]] name ''Fangorn'', from ''[[fang]]'' (\"beard\") and ''[[orn]]'' (\"tree\").<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 84</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nIn early versions of [[The Lord of the Rings]], Treebeard was an evil [[Giants|Giant]] who was in league with the [[Sauron|Enemy]]. It was he who held Gandalf captive, a role later given to Saruman, while in other drafts he tries to entrap the [[Frodo Baggins|Ring-bearer]] for his master by appearing friendly.<ref>{{RS|3XXI}}</ref>\n\nIn a later note he was considered as \"kindly and rather good\", and described as \"About 50 feet high with barky skin. Hair and beard rather like twigs. Clothed in dark green like a mail of short shining leaves. He has a castle in the [[Black Mountains]] and many thanes and followers. They look like young trees [?when] they stand.\"<ref>{{RS|Elrond}}</ref>{{rp|411}}\n\n== Inspiration ==\nTreebeard's booming voice was inspired by the way [[C.S.

Treebeard is carrying the hobbits through the forest, when Pippin gets an idea. He asks Treebeard to carry them towards [[Isengard]], claiming that it is the last place [[Saruman]] would look for them because it puts them so close to danger. Treebeard is initially confused, but ultimately succumbs to Pippin's request. When Treebeard gets close to the forest's edge, he sees the devastation wrought by Saruman's orcs. The trees have all been chopped down to serve as fuel for Saruman's war machine. Treebeard then makes a momentous decision, and calls for the other Ents.
