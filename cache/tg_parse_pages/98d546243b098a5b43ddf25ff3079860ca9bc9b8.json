and the malice of the Eye of Sauron few even of the great among Elves and Men could endure.|''[[Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age]]''}}\nThe '''Eye of Sauron''', generally called '''the Eye''', was a symbol of [[Sauron]] the [[Dark Lord]], mainly acknowledged when it was perceived by [[Frodo Baggins]] while carrying [[the One Ring]]. The Eye was projected as a mental image to show Sauron's unceasing vigilance and piercing perception. It was displayed as an emblem on the weaponry of Sauron's servants, or at least the [[Orcs]]'.\n\nSometimes used as a synonym for Sauron himself, it is also referred to as the '''Eye of Barad-dûr''', the '''Eye of Mordor''', the '''Great Eye''', and the '''Lidless Eye'''; and particularly as an emblem, the '''Red Eye''' or '''Evil Eye'''.<ref>{{RK|I3}}, entry \"Eye, the\"</ref>\n\n==History==\nWith the [[Downfall of Númenor]], the fair shape of [[Sauron]] had been destroyed, so when he came back to [[Mordor]], he was forced to take a different one. Once in [[Barad-dûr]] with his Ring, he wrought a new shape: \"an image of malice and hatred made visible; and the Eye of Sauron the Terrible few could endure.\"<ref>{{S|IV}}</ref> From the [[Window of the Eye]], the piercing Eye looked westwards in the direction of [[Mount Doom]].<ref name=Doom>{{RK|VI3}}, pp. 942</ref>\n\nMuch later, in the [[Third Age]], Frodo met [[Galadriel]] during the [[Quest of the Ring]], and she allowed him to see into her [[Mirror of Galadriel|Mirror]]. This showed him many things:\n\n{{blockquote|But suddenly the Mirror went altogether dark, as dark as if a hole had been opened in the world of sight [...]. In the abyss there appeared a single Eye that slowly grew, until it filled nearly all the Mirror. So terrible was it that Frodo stood rooted, unable to cry out or to withdraw his gaze. The Eye was rimmed with fire, but was itself glazed, yellow as a cat's, watchful and intent, and the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing.<br>Then the Eye began to rove, searching this way and that...}}\n\nHorrified, Frodo knew that the Eye was looking for him, among many other things, and it was trying to get into his mind if he allowed it. Once the vision ended, Galadriel told him that she knew what he had seen, for she could perceive Sauron, constantly trying to penetrate her mind. \"''But still the door is closed!''\"<ref>{{FR|II7}}, pp. 364-5</ref>\n\nSome days later, Frodo ran away from [[Boromir]] while wearing the Ring and sat upon the Seat at [[Amon Hen]]. There he could see many places attacked by the Dark Lord, until the vision showed him [[Mordor]] and [[Barad-dûr]]. Feeling hopeless, he felt the Eye within the Dark Tower, an eye \"that did not sleep\". Both Frodo and Sauron became aware of each other at that moment, but the will of Sauron began affecting him and almost became aware of his location, before Frodo jumped out of the Seat and took off the Ring.<ref>{{FR|II10}}, pp. 400-1</ref> [[Gandalf]] took part in this mental battle with the Eye, for he struggled with the '''Eye of Mordor''', which left him very weary.<ref>{{TT|III5}}, pp. 495, 499</ref>\n\nAs Frodo approached the [[Gates of Mordor]], the weight of the Ring became almost physical, but worst was the Eye, as he called it: \"that horrible growing sense of a hostile will that strove with great power to pierce all shadows of cloud, and earth, and flesh, and to see you [...]. Frodo knew just where the present habitation and heart of that will now was: as certainly as a man can tell the direction of the sun with his eyes shut. He was facing it, and its potency beat upon his brow.\" [[Gollum]] probably felt the Eye's pressure too, but he was too focused on his desire for the Ring.<ref>{{TT|IV2}}, pp. 630-1</ref> Sam could also feel the Eye while wearing the Ring in the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]], searching for the [[Ring-bearer]] in the shadows which it had created.<ref>{{RK|VI1}}, p. 898</ref>\n\nWhile entering [[Mount Doom]], Frodo and Sam could see the Eye in plain sight in the Window when winds removed the surrounding darkness of Barad-dûr: \"One moment only it stared out, but as from some great window immeasurably high there stabbed northward a flame of red, the flicker of a piercing Eye.\" Fortunately for them, Sauron was not watching the entry of the Orodruin, but looking northwards towards the [[Army of the West]]; but the vision of the Eye deeply shocked Frodo.<ref name=Doom/>\n\n===Emblem===\n[[File:J.R.R.

However, it is also featured as a physical, living object between the pinnacles of [[Barad-dûr]]. This is usually interpreted as Sauron's actual physical form during the War of the Ring. However, in the extended edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'', there is a scene where the camera zooms into the pupil of the Eye, briefly revealing Sauron in his humanoid, armoured form. In the film the Eye also literally searched the lands of Mordor with a red beam of light like a spotlight, and the light could be seen constantly sweeping the lands. It was quenched when [[the One Ring]] was cast into [[Orodruin]].\n\n'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:'''\n:In ''[[The Desolation of Smaug]]'', the Eye is shown, in which the pupil slowly becomes Sauron's shape as seen in ''The Lord of the Rings'' film series. Once we zoom into the Eye, we go through the pupil and see the Eye again, as an endless circle of the Void, portraying the 'window into nothing' from Tolkien's description.\n\n==External links==\n*\"[https://dc.swosu.edu/mythlore/vol4/iss1/1/ Sauron is Watching ''You'': The Role of the Great Eye in ''The Lord of the Rings'']\", by Edward Lense, in [[Mythlore 13|''Mythlore'' 13]] ([[1976]]), pp.3-6.\n\n==See also==\n* [[:Category:Images of the Eye of Sauron|Images of the Eye of Sauron]]\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Devices and symbols]]"}}}
