She worked for academic publishing companies and wrote entries for encyclopedias. In the early 1970s, she moved with her husband [[Wolfgang Krege]] to [[wikipedia:Stuttgart|Stuttgart]], where she worked for the [[wikipedia:Egmont Ehapa|Ehapa publishing house]] since [[1972]]. As a leading editor for the editorial department for children's and youth literature, Roswith Krege-Mayer administrated the German translations and publications of comic book series like ''[[wikipedia:Asterix|Asterix]]'', ''[[wikipedia:Mickey Mouse|Mickey Mouse]]'' (''Micky Maus''), ''[[wikipedia:Donald Duck pocket books|Donald Duck pocket books]]'' (''Das Lustige Taschenbuch''), ''[[wikipedia:Iznogoud|Iznogoud]]'' (''Isnogud''), ''[[wikipedia:Lucky Luke|Lucky Luke]]'' and ''[[wikipedia:Achille Talon|Achille Talon]]'' (''Albert Enzian'').<ref name=\"CF\"/>\n\nIn [[1991]] a revised anniversary edition of the first German translation of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]’s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' was published by [[Klett-Cotta]]. It contains for the first time the first part of [[Appendix E]] (''Pronunciation of Words and Names''), translated by [[Helmut W. Pesch]]. The translated text was improved by Roswith Krege-Mayer.<ref name=\"BIB\">Ute Lachenmayer (Ed.): ''Bibliographie – 25 Jahre Klett-Cotta (1977–2002)'', Stuttgart 2002, p. 300.</ref> Susanne Stopfel emphasizes in her essay ''Traitors and Translators: Three German Versions of The Lord of the Rings'', that Krege-Mayer had corrected some of the mistranslations made by the first translator [[Margaret Carroux]] but had added many others. Stopfel supposes, that Krege-Mayer was unfamiliar with Tolkien’s work and so particularly picked out apparent mistranslations at random, to correct them.<ref>Stopfel, Susanne: ''Traitors and Translators: Three German Versions of The Lord of the Rings'', in: [[Mallorn 43|''Mallorn'' 43]] (2005), p. 12.</ref> Roswith Krege-Mayer’s revised translation of ''The Lord of the Rings'' is out of print since [[1998]].<ref name=\"BIB\"/>\n\n== References ==\n\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:German people|Krege-Mayer, Roswith]]\n[[Category:Translators|Krege-Mayer, Roswith]]\n[[DE:Roswith Krege-Mayer]]"}}}
