For this reason, in his old age, he was selected by [[Morwen]] as one on the two guides to travel to [[Doriath]] with her son [[Túrin]]. They were successful, and Túrin was taken into King [[Thingol]]'s court, but unlike his companion [[Gethron]], Grithnir never saw his northern homelands again. He became sick while a guest in [[Menegroth]], and died before he could make the journey home.<ref>{{CH|4}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nThis character already appears in the early version of the [[Legendarium]] of ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', with the name '''''Gumlin'''''.<ref>{{LT2|IIn}}, p. 127</ref> Here he remains in [[Artanor]] after bringing Túrin, as he is too old. But years after Túrin is exiled, he begs [[Tinwelint]] to depart back to [[Hisilómë]] and he is granted two guides. He almost dies in the journey, as it was winter, but he is rescued by the men of [[Mavwin]]. This way Mavwin knew of Túrin's fame and misfortune, and wished to move to Artanor. The following spring, Gumlin died.<ref>{{LT2|II}}, pp. 78, 92-93</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Children of Húrin]]\n[[Category:Edain]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Folk of Hador]]\n[[Category:Gnomish names]]\n\n[[fi:Grithnir]]"}}}
