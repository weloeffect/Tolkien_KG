The marriage of Tarannon and Berúthiel was not a pleasant one: his love for the [[Belegaer|Sea]] drove her mad. She hated all making, all colours and elaborate adornment, and spent much of her time in her austere chambers with her ten cats. She hated all making, all colours and elaborate adornment, and sent her cats out to spy on everyone, learning their dark secrets. Berúthiel conversed with the cats and may have been able to read their memory. She even set the white cat to spy on the others, to torment them. The cats were feared and reviled in [[Gondor]], and people cursed upon seeing them. Berúthiel's reign of terror only came to an end at last when Tarannon banished her from the realm. He put her and her cats alone on a ship and set it adrift before a north wind. Berúthiel and her cats were last seen passing [[Umbar]], sailing away into the southern seas.<ref name=\"UTI7\">{{UT|Istari}}, note 7</ref> \n\nAll memory of them was erased (and the [[Book of the Kings]]), though legends of the cats and their ability to spy remain.<ref name=\"UTI7\" /><ref name=\"Journey\">{{FR|Journey}}</ref>\n\n===Other cats===\nThough there are no other cats that play a large role in history, some are mentioned in [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] folklore (for example, the Hobbit poem ''[[Cat (poem)|Cat]]''<ref name=\"Cat\">{{ATB|12}}</ref>). [[Bob]], the ostler of the [[Prancing Pony]], had a cat. After [[Frodo Baggins]] sang ''[[The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late]]'' (in which the ostler of an unnamed inn had a tipsy cat that played a five stringed fiddle), several patrons suggested that he had to do the same.<ref name=\"Sign\">{{FR|Sign}}</ref> Similarly, a cat, or \"four-legs\", was part of an old [[Riddle-game|riddle]] [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] asked [[Gollum]].<ref name=\"RitD\">{{H|Riddles}}</ref> \n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nOne of the more important cats in the development of the [[legendarium]] was [[Tevildo]], the Prince of Cats. Mentioned only in early writings of ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', Tevildo was a demonic servant of [[Melko]], who would eventually be replaced by [[Sauron]].<ref>{{LT1|Music}}, p. 52</ref> He is the principal antagonist in ''[[The Tale of Tinúviel]]''.<ref>{{LT2|I}}, passim; see pp. 53-6</ref> Other cats appearing in ''The Tale of Tinúviel'' include [[Miaulë]], [[Oikeroi]], and [[Umuiyan]].\n\nIn this early stages of the [[Elvish]] languages, the [[Gnomish]] vocabulary about cats was ''miog'' (\"cat\"), ''miaug''/''miog'' (\"tom cat\"), ''miaulin'' (\"she cat\").<ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 57</ref> The [[Qenya]] word for \"cat\" is ''meoi''.<ref>{{LT2|Appendix}}, entry \"Tevildo\"</ref> Later Qenya words were ''miue'' (\"cat\"), ''titse'' (\"kitten\").<ref>{{PE|21}}, pp. 12-13, 20, 27</ref>\n\n==Other writings==\n[[Tinker]] was a \"large black cat\" appearing in the novella ''[[Roverandom]]''. She lived with [[Rover]] in the same house.<ref>{{Rover|1}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of Rover's adventures, Tinker did not believe a single word about Rover's adventures because of she was jealous of him.<ref>{{Rover|5}}</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nEspecially in the case of Berúthiel and Tevildo, cats in Middle-earth are portrayed in a negative light. It could be argued that Tolkien was not a cat-person. When a cat-breeder asked permission to use names from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' for her cats, Tolkien replied to [[Allen and Unwin|Allen & Unwin]]: \n{{blockquote|I fear that to me Siamese cats belong to the fauna of Mordor, but you need not tell the cat breeder that.|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Letter 219]] (dated [[14 October|October 14]], [[1959]])}}\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations== \n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Cats are found throughout Middle-earth, especially in Bree-land. There is a \"cat lady\" who has a house full of cats. Lore-masters can also have a non-combat cat pet.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Cats| ]]\n[[Category:Servants of Melkor]]\n\n[[de:Katzen]]"}}}
