After he found them and the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] attacked, Glorfindel dismounted and placed [[Frodo Baggins]] (the [[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]]) on its back, then ordered it forward to safety at the [[Ford of Bruinen]]. Asfaloth was a remarkably fast horse, outpacing the black steeds of the Black Riders, even so that it reached the Fords first.<ref>{{FR|Flight}}, pp. 209, 211-214</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Asfaloth'' is [[Sindarin]] for \"Sunlit Foam\", from ''[[ast]]'' (\"light or heat of the sun\") + ''[[faloth]]'' (\"large foamy wave\").<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 18</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn answer to a question from [[Rhona Beare]] in 1958, Tolkien admitted that Glorfindel would not have used a bridle and bit when riding Asfaloth; instead he would only have used an ornamental headstall with a plume, jewels, and small bells. He assured her that he would change ''bridle and bit'' to ''headstall'' in future editions, a change that was made.<ref>{{L|211}}, p. 279</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''\n:Asfaloth carries Frodo to Rivendell.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]], \"The Knife In The Dark\"</ref>\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring - Asfaloth.jpg|thumb|Asfaloth in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'']]\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''\n:Asfaloth is the horse of [[Arwen]], having taken over [[Glorfindel]]'s role.
