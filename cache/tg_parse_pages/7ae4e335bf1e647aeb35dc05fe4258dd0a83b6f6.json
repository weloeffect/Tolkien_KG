To what degree he participated in the slaughter is unknown, but later he composed the lament ''[[Noldolantë]]'', the Fall of the [[Noldor]], in memory of the terrible event.<ref name=\"Flight\"/> Following [[Fëanor]] into exile, Maglor witnessed his father die after he had fought [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]].<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Marya Filatova - The one who stays - 1.jpg|thumb|left|The wife of Maglor. Art by [[Marya Filatova]]|125px]]\nThe sons of Fëanor settled in the eastern part of [[Beleriand]].  Maglor's ward was the opening in the hills between the two arms of the [[Gelion]] River, which acquired the name of '''[[Maglor's Gap]]'''.  Due to the lack of hills, the Gap was a natural route for attacks from the north, and the Noldor kept a strength of cavalry in that region.<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>\n\nMaglor's Gap was held for four and a half centuries.  However, in the [[Dagor Bragollach]] the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Glaurung]] invaded and laid waste to Maglor's land, forcing Maglor to flee to the fortress of his brother [[Maedhros]] on the hill of [[Himring]] to the west.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> Sixteen years later, he and Maedhros marched to the great battle that the [[Elves]] hoped would see their revenge upon [[Morgoth]], but they were defeated, partly by the treachery of [[Uldor the Accursed]]. Maglor himself slew Uldor, but all of the sons of Fëanor were wounded and they were forced to retreat to [[Mount Dolmed]]. The heavy loss led to the name of the battle thereafter: the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] or the \"Battle of Unnumbered Tears.\"  Maglor and his brothers took to a wild woodland life in [[Ossiriand]].<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, one of the three [[Silmarils]] had been recovered from [[Iron Crown|Morgoth's Crown]].<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>  From his parents, [[Dior|Dior Eluchíl]] received the jewel and brought it to [[Doriath]]. True to their oath, the sons of Fëanor (led by [[Celegorm]]) demanded the Silmaril. When Dior refused to surrender it the brothers assaulted Thingol's ancient kingdom. [[Celegorm]], [[Caranthir]] and [[Curufin]] all fell, as did Dior and his wife, [[Nimloth of Doriath]]. But the four remaining brothers - Maglor, Maedhros, [[Amras]] and [[Amrod]] - did not recover the Silmaril, for [[Elwing]], the daughter of Dior and Nimloth, escaped.<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>\n[[File:Turner Mohan - Maglor's Fosterling.jpg|thumb|175px|''Maglor's Fosterling'' by [[:Category:Images by Turner Mohan|Turner Mohan]]]]\nEventually the three brothers heard tiding that [[Elwing]] possessed a Silmaril and dwelt at the [[Mouths of Sirion]]. Driven by their Oath, the remaining sons of Fëanor made a sudden attack upon the refugees of [[Gondolin]] and Doriath. However they were again thwarted, for Elwing escaped with the Silmaril across the [[Belegaer|Sea]] to her husband [[Eärendil]]. Together, they sailed into the [[Aman|West]] and their voyage would eventually cause the downfall of Morgoth. Meanwhile, [[Elrond]] and [[Elros]], Eärendil and Elwing's sons, captured in the battle, were adopted by Maglor, and it is said that love grew between them. It is also said that Maglor's heart grew sick with the Oath of Fëanor.\n[[Image:Ted Nasmith - Maglor Casts a Silmaril into the Sea.jpg|thumb|175px|''Maglor Casts a Silmaril into the Sea'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\n\n=== Post-'War of Wrath' history ===\nAfter Morgoth's fall, the last two Silmarils were recovered from his [[Iron Crown]]. By this time, only Maedhros and Maglor remained of Fëanor's sons. In weariness and loathing, they demanded the jewels from [[Eönwë]], the herald of [[Manwë]]. Eönwë refused them the Silmarils due to their many evil deeds. Still driven, the two brothers crept into the camp of Eönwë and stole the jewels.\n\nThough they were caught, Eönwë let them depart. Each brother took one jewel, but their evil deeds caused the holy Jewels to burn their hands. Maedhros in despair cast himself into a fiery fissure. Maglor, the last surviving son of Fëanor, threw his Silmaril into the Sea. Legend says that he still wanders the shores of the World, singing laments for his despair and regret.<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref> It is possible that some time later Maglor cast himself into the Sea, meeting his eventual doom.<ref name=\"L131\"/><ref>{{LB|4}}, p. 353: \"[Maglor] ''son of Fëanor, forgotten harper, singer doomed, who young when Laurelin yet bloomed to endless lamentation passed and in the tombless sea was cast''.\"</ref><ref>[[Letter to Eileen Elgar (5 March 1964)]], ''[[Concerning ...

The shorter form was '''''Káno'''''.
