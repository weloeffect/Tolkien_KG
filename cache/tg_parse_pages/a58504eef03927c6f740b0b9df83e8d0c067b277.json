The other two being the ''[[Ann-thennath]]'', and the ''[[Linnod]]''. The Minlamad thent/estent is typically used in narns, intending to be spoken rather than sung.\n\n==History==\nThe verse form was used by the poet, [[Dírhaval]], in his sole work, the [[Narn i Chîn Húrin]] (The Tale of the Children of Húrin)\n\n==Etymology==\nThe ''minlamad thent/estent'' can be broken up as follows: [[Sindarin]] ''[[minlamed]]'' = ''first-echoing'', referring to alliteration. ''[[thent]]'' = ''short''. The ending ''[[estent]]'' is likely derived from ''thent'', possibly meaning ''very short''. In poetic notation, a ''/'' indicates a stressed syllable. ''minlamed'' could be related to the Elvish root for sound, in which case, the meaning changes to ''one-sound-stop''. In this case, the ''ann-thennath'' could mean ''long lines''.<ref>[[Tolkien's Legendarium|''Tolkien's Legendarium: Essays on'' The History of Middle-earth]]: [[Patrick Wynne]] and [[Carl F. Hostetter]], \"Three Elvish Verse Modes: ''Ann-thennath'', ''Minlamad thent'' / ''estent'', and ''Linnod''\", pp. 121-2</ref>\n\n==Other Versions of the Legendarium==\nIn ‘’Unfinished Tales'' (Page 146), Christopher Tolkien gave the term the name of ''Minlamed thent/estent''. In ''The War of the Jewels'' (page 311/315, note #3), he revealed his mistake and that the term’s name actually was just ''Minlamad thent/estent''.\n\n==External links==\n* https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1153028727.html?neo\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Songs]]\n[[Category:Sindarin nouns]]\n[[fi:Minlamad thent/estent]]"}}}
