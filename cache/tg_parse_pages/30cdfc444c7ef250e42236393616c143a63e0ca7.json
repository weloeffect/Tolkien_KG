It was a foul place of horror for absolutely nothing grew in the polluted soil.  Pools of water were choked with ash and muds, slag-mounds of crushed and powered rock abounded, and cones of earth fire-blasted and stained with poison rose as if they were part of a graveyard.<ref>{{TT|Marshes}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn {{TA|1944}} the [[Wainriders]] and men of [[Khand]] defeated the northern army of [[Gondor]] and killed King [[Ondoher]] of Gondor on a hill in the Desolation of the Morannon,<ref>{{UT|8a}}, twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth paragraph</ref> on which King [[Aragorn|Elessar]] would later fight the forces of [[Sauron]] in {{TA|3019}}.<ref>{{UT|8e}}, note 16</ref>\n\n[[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], led by [[Gollum]], reached the Desolation of the Morannon on [[4 March]], {{TA|3019}}.
