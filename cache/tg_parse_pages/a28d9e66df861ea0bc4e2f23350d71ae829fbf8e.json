The Rhovanion Hills was invented for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'' by [[Amazon Studios]].\n\n== History ==\nThe Rhovanion Hills was the location of the [[Norfield Glen]], one of the seasonal havens where a tribe of [[Harfoots]] migrated to in mid-summer due to the edible snails that were said to live there. Due to the isolation of the Harfoots, they entered into the myths and legends of the hunters who dwelled within the hills, warding them off whenever they come too close to the Norfield Glen.\n\nIn the late [[Second Age]], a meteorite crashed within these hills somewhere relatively close by to the Norfield Glen, carrying a [[The Stranger|mysterious person]] with it. The crash site was discovered by [[Elanor Brandyfoot]] and [[Poppy Proudfellow]].\n\nLater, a group of three [[Mystics]] came upon the crash site, seeking to find the stranger.\n\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) locations]]"}}}
