It is claimed in the [[Red Book of Westmarch]] that the arrangement that Men and Hobbits each minded their own affairs in their own ways, but regarding each other as necessary parts of the population and being on friendly terms existed only in Bree-land.<ref name=\"Sign\" />\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Plan of Bree.jpeg|thumb|200px|left|\"Plan of Bree\" by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]\nThe village was built under and on the western slopes of [[Bree-hill]]. It was surrounded by a deep ditch with a thick hedge on its inner side that ran in more than half of a circle from the hill and back to it. The great East Road entered the village through the West-gate of the hedge on the western side of the village, curved to the right to run around the foot of the hill, exited the village in its southern corner<ref name=\"Sign\" /> through the South-gate of the hedge and then curved to the left back to its easward line.<ref name=\"FR|Knife\">{{FR|Knife}}, p. 181</ref> Both gates<ref>{{RK|Homeward}}, p. 989</ref> were closed and guarded by gatekeepers after nightfall who had small lodges on the inside of the gates.<ref name=\"Sign\" /> During the [[War of the Ring]] the [[West-gate of Bree]] was guarded by [[Harry Goatleaf]].<ref name=\"Homeward\" />\n\nThe village consisted of about a hundred stone houses, most of them on the slope of the hill above the road with windows on their western side, in which the Men lived. The hill itself was burrowed by [[Hobbit-holes]], in which the Hobbits  lived<ref name=\"FR|Sign\">{{FR|Sign}}, p. 156</ref> especially on the higher slopes above the houses of the Men. An inn called [[The Prancing Pony]] was located on the eastern side of the road where it curved to the south to go around the hill.<ref name=\"Sign\" />\n\n==History==\nAccording to their tales the [[Men of Bree]] had settled in Bree in the [[Elder Days]]. They were [[Pre-Númenóreans]] that had migrated from the valleys of the [[White Mountains]] to the southern valleys of the [[Misty Mountains]] and then north as far as the Barrow Downs.<ref name=\"Men\">{{App|Men}}, p. 1130</ref> Although few of them survived the turmoils of the Elder Days, they continued to settle in Bree when the [[Númenóreans]] returned to Middle-earth.<ref name=\"Sign\" />\n\nIn {{SA|3320}},<ref>{{App|SA}}, entry for the year 3320, p. 1084</ref> Bree and the Bree-land became a part of the kingdom of Arnor<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, p. 1039</ref> and the Men of Bree abandoned their old language and adopted [[Westron]] as their native language.<ref name=\"Men\" /> When the Kingdom of Arnor was divided in {{TA|861}},<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 861, p. 1085</ref> Bree probably became a part of [[Arthedain]], one of the three successor states of Arnor, because Arthedain included the land north of the East Road as far as the [[Weather Hills]]<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', p. 1039</ref> and because most of the houses of Bree were north of the East road on the slopes of Bree-hill<ref name=\"Sign\" /> and Staddle, Combe and Archet, the other villages of Bree-land were also located north of the East Road.<ref name=\"FR|Knife\" /> However, the possession of Weathertop and the land westwards towards Bree was a matter of debate between Arthedain and the other successor kingdoms of [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]], because Cardolan and Rhudaur desired to have the [[Palantíri|Palantír]] of the Tower of Weathertop as Arthedain already possessed the other two Palantírs of the North.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', p. 1040</ref>\n\nAround {{TA|1300}} many [[Hobbits]] migrated westward from eastern Eriador and many settled in Bree.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year ''c.'' 1300, p. 1086</ref> In {{TA|1601}} many Hobbits left Bree and went west beyond the river [[Baranduin]] and founded a colony within Arthedain, [[The Shire]].<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1601, p. 1086</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Fall of Fornost]] and Arnor in {{TA|1945}},<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1945, p. 1086</ref> the north-south road was only used seldomly and was referred to as the Greenway by the Bree-folk, because it had become overgrown by grass. Bree continued to exist with the unknown protection of the [[Rangers of the North]]. Even at the end of the Third Age Bree remained relatively prosperous. Bree was the most westerly settlement of men from the point of view of the Shire by the time of the War of the Ring and had a sizable Hobbit population. Thanks to its location near a major road crossing, one could encounter travelers including Men, Dwarves and Hobbits in a bustling Bree inn. The Rangers of the North also were known to stop in Bree.<ref>{{FR|Sign}}, p. 150</ref>\n\nOn [[15 March]]<ref>{{App|Durin}}, footnote after \"On a time\", p. 1077</ref> {{TA|2941}} [[Gandalf]] and [[Thorin]] met seemingly by accident at Bree. They were both thinking about the same problem: the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Smaug]] at the [[Lonely Mountain]]. The meeting led to the undertaking of the [[Quest of Erebor]], which resulted in the death of Smaug and the finding of [[the One Ring]] by [[Bilbo Baggins]].<ref>{{App|Durin}}, footnote, p. 1077-8</ref>\n\nFrom about {{TA|2953}} on the wizard [[Saruman]] began to have agents in Bree.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2953, p. 1089</ref>\n\nOn [[29 September]] {{TA|3018}},<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3018, September 29, p. 1091</ref> [[Frodo Baggins]], [[Samwise Gamgee]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and [[Peregrin Took]] arrived in Bree and met [[Aragorn|Strider]] at the largest inn in Bree, The Prancing Pony, owned by [[Barliman Butterbur]].<ref name=\"FR|Sign\" /> After Meriadoc had been attacked by a [[Nazgûl|Ringwraith]] Strider feared an attack by servants of the Ringwraiths and convinced them to spend the night in the parlour of the inn instead of their rooms. [[Nob]], an employee of Barliman, stuffed the beds in their rooms to make it appear as if someone was sleeping in them.<ref>{{FR|Strider}}, pp. 173-4</ref> In the morning of [[30 September]], {{TA|3018}},<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3018, September 30, p. 1091</ref> they discovered that the windows to their rooms had been forced open and that their stuffed beds had been slashed and left Bree on the same day.<ref>{{FR|Knife}}, pp. 177-181</ref>\n\nWhen [[Travellers|Frodo and his companions]] returned to Bree on [[28 October]], {{TA|3019}},<ref>{{App|Chief}}, entry for the year 3019, October 28, p. 1096</ref> Barliman Butterbur told them that Bree had been raided early in the year by [[ruffians]] from the south during the War of the Ring. Barliman Butterbur believed that they had been let into Bree by Harry Goatleaf and Bill Ferny, who had been on the side of the ruffians and who had fled Bree with them after they had lost the fight against the inhabitants of Bree. In the resulting [[Set-to in Bree|set-to]] three Men and two Hobbits from Bree were killed. The defeated ruffians fled to the woods beyond Archet and the wilds where they lived as robbers so that travelling on the road was no longer safe. As a result the inhabitants of Breeland locked up their dwellings early, kept watchers all around the hedge and guarded the gates with a lot of men during the night. He also informed them that the Bree-landers had not understood how much the Rangers of the North had done for their safety, because after they all left (to fight in the War of the Ring in the south) wolves had howled around the fences in the winter and there were dark shapes in the woods, dreadful things that make the blood run cold when he thought of them.<ref name=\"Homeward\">{{RK|Homeward}}, p. 992</ref> After staying in Bree for two nights, Frodo and his companions left Bree on [[30 October]], {{TA|3019}}.<ref>{{App|Chief}}, entry for the year 3019, October 30, p. 1096</ref>\n\nAfter the War of the Ring at the end of the [[Third Age]], the North-kingdom of Arnor was reestablished by [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, p. 1042</ref> It is probable that Bree became a part of Arnor again and became more prosperous through increased traffic on the Greenway and the East Road, because Gandalf announced that the king would soon be turning his mind to Bree, the Greenway would be opened again, there would be traffic, there would be people and fields where there was wilderness before and that there would be room enough for people between the [[Isen]] and the [[Greyflood]] and along the shorelands south of the Baranduin and that many folk used to live at the northern end of the Greenway on the [[North Downs]] or by [[Lake Evendim]].<ref name=\"Homeward\" />\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Bree'' is an English place name that is based on a [[Celtic]] word for \"hill\".<ref name=\"N\">{{HM|N}}, entry '''Archet''', p. 765</ref>\n\n[[Wayne Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] suggest that the name ''Bree'' is derived from the [[Welsh]] word ''bre'', which means \"hill\".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 16</ref> [[Tom Shippey]] also points out that ''Bree'' means \"hill\" in Welsh.<ref name=\"Road\">[[Tom Shippey]], [[The Road to Middle-earth]], Chapter 4: A Cartographic Plot, Getting started, third edition, p. 124</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] chose the name ''Bree'' to represent the survival of a trace of the former language of the Men of Bree and modelled it on a British (i.e. Celtic) word, which meant \"hill\".<ref>{{App|Translation}}, p. 1135</ref> He referred to [[wikipedia:Brill, Buckinghamshire|Brill]] in his [[Nomenclature of The Lord of the Rings]] when he explained that the name [[Chetwood]] was a [[Wikipedia:List of tautological place names|tautological]] compound of a Celtic word for \"wood\" and the english word \"wood\" and stated that the name ''Brill'' was derived from the Celtic word ''bree'' and the English word \"hill\".<ref name=\"N\" /> \n\n[[Christopher Tolkien]] confirmed that the name ''Bree'' is based on ''Brill'' in [[wikipedia:Buckinghamshire|Buckinghamshire]], which his father knew well.<ref>{{RS|1VIIN}}, note 6, p. 131</ref> Tom Shippey also suggests that J.R.R. Tolkien was inspired by the town of ''Brill'', which is located on a hill ten miles from [[Oxford]], when he chose the names ''Bree'' and Bree-hill.<ref name=\"Road\" />\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nJ.R.R. Tolkien drew a plan of Bree during the writing of [[The Lord of the Rings]], which corresponds to the description of Bree in the final published version.<ref>{{RS|3XXP}}, p. 333</ref>\n\nAn earlier manuscript about of the Heirs of Elendil, which later became the Annals of the Kings and Rulers and an earlier manuscript version of The Tale of Years mention that Bree was in Cardolan.<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, Commentary, manuscript B, The Heirs of Elendil, The Northern Line of Arnor: the Isildurioni, entry for Eärendur</ref><ref>{{PM|Third}}, manuscript T4, The Third Age, entry for the year 861</ref> It is possible that the statement that Bree was in Cardolan was deliberately not retained in the published text, because a statement was added in a later manuscript about the Heirs of Elendil that Cardolan was south of the Great Road before the existing statement that Cardolan was east of the Baranduin.<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, manuscript C, The Heirs of Elendil, The Northern Line of Arnor: the Isildurioni, entry 10. Eärendur</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Bree map.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Bree in [[The Lord of the Rings Online]].]]\n\nWith the absence of [[Tom Bombadil]] and the [[Barrow-downs]] in most adaptations, the distance between Bree and the Shire seems shorter than it really was.\n\n'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''\n:After leaving the [[Old Forest]], the Hobbits appear in the Prancing Pony without delay or introduction. The rooms were raided by [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]] rather than servants of them.\n\n'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''\n:Here too, Bombadil and the Barrow-downs were omitted. After taking a short walk through Bree, the hobbits enter the Pony. Merry goes out for a walk, and is found by [[Bob]] the ostler. Once again, it is the Ringwraiths rather than servants of them who raid the Pony.\n\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'''''\n:Frodo and his companions arrive at Bree almost immediately after the scene in which they leave the Shire. All are present in Strider's room when the  Ringwraiths crash the gate, trample the gatekeeper, and raid the Prancing Pony.\n\n'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''\n:The role of Bree is greatly expanded, due to the interactiveness of the medium. It is the place where the Hobbits meet Strider, and the player shifts perspective. Strider searches the streets of Bree for Merry and materials to make decoys for (once again) the Ringwraiths to slash, while the streets are crowded with robbers and wolves.\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Bree is one of the major cities in the north, located in Bree-land, probaly the most important city in the game. It faces threats from several fronts: [[Sharkey]]'s brigands have already began making their way into [[Bree-land]], the [[Barrow-downs]] are stirring following the passage of the [[Nazgûl]] and a small band of [[Orcs]] has made their way from the [[North Downs]]. The citizens of Bree know more of the bigger world than [[The Shire|Shire]] dwellers, but are still oblivious to the dangers they could face. The town's mayor and the watchers don't trust the [[Rangers of the North]], insisting they can manage their own affairs. Later, during the winter of {{TA|3019}}, Bree is overrun by Sharkey's Brigands and [[Half-orcs]] and has to be liberated by Free Peoples - an event references as \"Thievery and Mischief\" by [[Barliman Butterbur]] later.\n\n[[File:Bree-WITN1.png|thumb|250px|Bree in [[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]].]]\n'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''\n:[[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]], [[Andriel]] and [[Farin (video game character)|Farin]] visit Bree in the beginning of the game, just a few days before [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] reached the town.

Gandalf tells Thorin of his meeting with [[Thráin]], his worries about [[Smaug|the dragon]], and his wish to see Thorin retake the [[Lonely Mountain]].
