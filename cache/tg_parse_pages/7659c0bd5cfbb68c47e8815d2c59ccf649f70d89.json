Millions saw Hollywood's fantasy version of J.R.R. Tolkien's one and only love, Edith Bratt, in the 2019 movie, ''Tolkien''. Fact, though, is stranger than fiction, and more interesting. Edith's story reveals a gallant heroine suffering under \"The Shadow of the Past.\" Edith was Ronald's \"lover,\" and much like her mother, Edith risked all for the man she loved. New research finds a financially independent and strong woman who was not only John Ronald's equal, but his muse, his anchor of stability in the present, and his hope for the future.<br/><br/>Admirers, enthusiasts, and students of Tolkien will find much new material to enrich their understanding and appreciation of Tolkien. Placing the development of John Ronald Tolkien's Elvish languages, mythology, and art during the crucial years of 1916-18 in a new biographical context that includes the importance and significance of Edith Bratt culminates in the pivotal story of Lúthien and Beren with new unsuspected sources and the complementary artwork of ''The Fair Towns of Holy Tol Eressëa''. A fresh awareness of the compelling and pervasive influence and effect of Tolkien's biography on his oeuvre suggests new views and possibilities for further investigations. }}\n\n==Reception==\nThe book was reviewed by [[Shaun Gunner]], Chair of [[The Tolkien Society]] in the journal ''[[Mallorn (journal)|Mallorn]]''. In reviewing the book, Gunner said he felt the authors had done a \"genuinely thorough job in looking into Edith’s early life and upbringing, teaching about her family, education, wealth and accommodation.\" However, he critiqued the book as \"incomplete\" for only covering her life from her birth to 1917, for making their own suppositions, and for \"pointed\" critiques of [[Humphrey Carpenter]]'s [[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography|biography of Tolkien]]. He concluded he could only \"partially\" recommend the work.<ref>[[Shaun Gunner]], review of ''The Gallant Edith Bratt'' in [[Mallorn 63|''Mallorn'' 63]], ed. Luke Shelton, pp. 47-8</ref>\n\n[[Christina Scull]] and [[Wayne G. Hammond]], writing in the ''[[Journal of Tolkien Research]]'', took a similar line to Gunner saying that the authors \"usefully expand our sources of information on\nEdith’s early life. Their industry in doing so is commendable\". However, Scull and Hammond were similarly frustrated by the \"concentrated siege\" on Humphrey Carpenter, and concluded: \"Bunting and Hamill-Keays’s book [..] is haphazardly argued, excessively speculative, and sometimes vituperative, and cannot be recommended except for the few new facts it firmly documents.\"<ref>[[Christina Scull]] and [[Wayne G.
