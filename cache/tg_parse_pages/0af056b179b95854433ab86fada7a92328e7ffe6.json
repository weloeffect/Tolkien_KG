For example, the first edition Forword mentioned the descendants of Master [[Samwise Gamgee]], thus reassuring that he would survive the adventure. Other references include that the [[One Ring]] won't be used, and hints about the treachery of [[Saruman]].\n\n==First edition==\nIn the Foreword to the first edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'',<ref group=note>Reprinted in \"greater part\" in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'' (pp. 25-6), and in its entirety in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'' (pp. lxviii-lxx).</ref> Tolkien imposes himself as merely translator and editor of the text to come, thus sharing the [[legendarium|in-universe]] character of the [[1951]] [[The Hobbit Preface|prefatory note]] to the second edition of ''[[The Hobbit]]''.\n\nTolkien disliked his own text, noting that it mixes real-life matters of his life (including referencing the [[Inklings]] and [[Tolkien family|his children]]) with the [[secondary world|in-universe]] \"machinery\" of the Tale.<ref>{{PM|II}}, p. 26</ref>\n\nThe full, original text of this Foreword can be found in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', under the \"Foreword to the Second Edition\" section.\n\n==Second and later editions==\nIn [[1965]] [[Ballantine Books]] needed a new text in order to renew the copyright in the United States, and to challenge the controversy raised by [[Ace Books]]. For that edition Tolkien wrote a new Foreword.<ref name=rc>{{HM|RC}}</ref>{{rp|p. lxx}}\n\nThe Foreword written specifically for Ballantine ends with a paragraph where Tolkien thanks the American readers for their courtesy, and makes a reference to the copyright laws and the unauthorised edition (which he compares it to something that Saruman would do) and pleaded them to prefer only the edition authorised by him, dedicating the book to all those who will enjoy the story. This paragraph is absent to European editions.<ref name=rc/>{{rp|p. lxxx}}\n\nAs for the previous paragraph (where Tolkien mentions that there have been alterations, corrections and additions in that edition, like notes and a small index) sometimes is omitted, or replaced by a new text describing alterations (like the absence of the [[Appendices]]).<ref name=rc/>{{rp|p. lxxix}}\n\nThe original text wrote that his work \"has been read by many people since it finally appeared in print ten years ago\", a number that was updated in subsequent printings. The number was omitted in [[1976]] on a suggestion by Christopher Tolkien.<ref name=\"rc\"/>{{rp|p. lxxiiv}}\n\n===Mistakes===\nRecollecting the writing of the book 25 years earlier, the references to dates and progress of writing, are inaccurate (possibly false memories), contradicting more detailed letters that Tolkien had written while composing the story. \n\nFor example Tolkien claims that he began writing ''The Lord of the Rings'' soon after completing ''The Hobbit''; and when ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' was rejected, he \"went back to the sequel\". In reality it was right then, December [[1937]], when he ''started'' writing the book.<ref name=rc/>{{rp|pp. lxxi-lxxii}}\n\nAnother example is the hiatus in [[1940]], after writing about [[Balin's Tomb]], until late [[1941]]. [[Christopher Tolkien]] says that it contradicts contemporary [[Letter 37]]; the hiatus was probably in [[1939]] until [[August]] [[1940]].<ref name=rc/>{{rp|p. xxiii}}<ref>{{RS|Moria}}, p. 461</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[The Hobbit Preface|''The Hobbit'' prefatory note]]\n\n{{references|n}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:''The Lord of the Rings'' Foreword}}\n{{lotr}}\n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings chapters|Foreword]]\n[[fi:Esipuhe (TSH)]]"}}}
