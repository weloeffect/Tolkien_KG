Tolkien\n* Dimensions 15.7 x 10 x 2.7 inches\n* Weight 4.6 pounds\n==Background==\nThe text of ''The Lord of the Rings'' has been revised and corrected multiple times throughout its several publications and editions, but new errors, mainly typographical, always have been introduced, especially after each resetting of type;<ref name=xliv/> notable cases were when the printer reset the metal types of ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' soon after its publication, and in [[1994]] when [[HarperCollins]] digitized the text.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, pp. xxxix, xl</ref>\n\nBoth J.R.R. Tolkien and his son, [[Christopher Tolkien]], had prepared lists of such errors to guide emendations for future editions. Steven M. Frisby had also made comparisons of different ''LotR'' copies, and researched Tolkien's original manuscripts in the libraries at the [[Marquette University]]. [[David Bratman]] also authored ''A Corrigenda to The Lord of the Rings'' in [[The Tolkien Collector]] #6. Similar lists and comments have been made independently by scholars such as [[Douglas Anderson]], [[Charles Noad]] and [[Arden Smith]].\n\n[[Wayne Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] for many years also studied and compared the texts and their inconsistencies. Consulting the abovementioned works, along with their own examination of the Marquette manuscripts, the [[Allen and Unwin]] archive, unpublished correspondence between Tolkien and Allen & Unwin, and of course [[The History of The Lord of the Rings|volumes 6-9]] of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', they had compiled \"an exhaustive and up to date catalogue\" of errors, corrections and their emendations throughout the publication's history. \n\nFor the 50th anniversary, the couple proposed a new effort to produce a text as close as possible to the [[Wikipedia:authorial intent|authorial intent]]. Tolkien's publishers and the [[Tolkien Estate]] agreed. HarperCollins provided searchable text files that helped detect inconsistencies in spelling and punctuation, despite Tolkien's stated preferences. They presented 229 such questionable points to Christopher Tolkien.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. xli</ref>\n\nSupervised by Christopher Tolkien, and based on the latest compared text, the couple made fixes to typographical errors and mistakes, and corrections to the text when it was certain that the latest text reflected Tolkien's preference. Whenever those were clear, spelling and capitalization were regularized. More substantial textual mistakes (see below) were conservatively considered by case.<ref name=xlii>{{HM|RC}}, p. xlii</ref> Christopher Tolkien was positive in \"getting rid\" of such inconsistencies that distract observant readers, pointing out that were his father notified about them, he would immediately correct them.<ref name=xliv>{{HM|RC}}, p. xliv</ref>\n\nAn example of textual mistake has been the phrase \"from the lowlands to the Dwarf-kingdom\" (Book II, Chapter 6) which has been changed to \"from the lowlands '''of''' the Dwarf-kingdom\" in a subsequent edition (whereas Moria had no lowlands); the couple restored it to its original correct form.<ref name=xlii/>\n\nSome mistakes that the editors failed to notice, or new ones introduced by bugs of the software, were further corrected for the [[2005]] reprint.<ref name=xliv/>\n\n==Changes to the text==\n;[[Prologue Concerning Hobbits, and other matters]]:\n:*[[Bandobras Took]] now is the grandson of [[Isengrim Took II]] according to [[Appendix C]].\n:*The [[Westmarch]] was added to the Shire in {{SR|1452}} according to [[Appendix B]].\n;[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]:\n:*The distance between the [[Brandywine Ferry]] to the [[Brandywine Bridge]] has been corrected to ''ten'' instead of ''twenty''.\n:*The ponies [[Fredegar Bolger]] prepared for the travelers was changed to ''five'' instead of ''six''.\n;[[Appendix A]]:\n:*Haudh en Gwanur becomes [[Haudh in Gwanûr]].\n;Several dates in the [[Appendix B|Tale of Years]]:\n:*[[Silmariën]]'s birth: from {{SA|548}} to {{SA|521}}.\n:*The events of {{TA|2852}}, like the death of the [[Dead Tree]], have been corrected to {{TA|2872}}.\n:*[[Sam Gamgee]]'s birth: from {{TA|2983}} to {{TA|2980}}\n:*The [[Mirror of Galadriel]] sequence happened on [[15 February]] instead of [[16 February|16]].\n;[[Appendix C]] is appended with two more Family Trees from ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'':\n:*[[Bolger Family#Bolger Family Tree|Bolger of Budgeford]]\n:*[[Boffin Family#Boffin Family Tree|Boffin of the Yale]]\n{{stub}}\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lord of the Rings (50th Anniversary Edition)}}\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings editions]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
