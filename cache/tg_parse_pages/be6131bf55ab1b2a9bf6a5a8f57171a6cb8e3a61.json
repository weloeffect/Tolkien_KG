Feel free to add new suggestions of things to be improved in the wiki, but remember this is \"''the J.R.R. Tolkien encyclopedia that anyone can edit''\", so you can also pick a task and get into it. Just do not forget to follow the [[Tolkien Gateway:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]]. Users can also be involved in wider [[Tolkien Gateway:Projects|projects]].\n\n==Wiki updating==\n;Discussed by gatekeepers in Discord\n* Create a common bot for technical stuff.\n** Change images in publication infoboxed to 275px.\n* Create [[Tolkien Gateway:General disclaimer]].\n* Update favicon.\n* Displaytitle is ignored when there is no direct equivalence with the page's actual title.\n* Make easier guidelines for new editors.\n* Remake [[Tolkien Gateway:Projects]]. \n* Give linguistics stuff its own project.\n\n==New Letters==\n* Include the new info all over the wiki. (The new letters provide entirely biographical information, not further knowledge on the legendarium)\n\n==Pages needing rewriting/improvements==\n===[[Quanta Sarmë]]===\n;Pointed by Erkenbard in Discord\n* the page about Quanta Sarmë says that \"its usage and characters are a mystery\" and lacks any information about qanta-tenkele from [[PE22]], while that system, fully explained there and readily useable, is essentially the same full writing system as later Quanta Sarmë, I believe, or at least it is worth mentioning in connection with the latter; so some of the editors with access to PE22 might want to take a look at this matter.\n\n===[[Silvan Elvish]]===\n;Explained by Ellanto in Discord\nDuring the 2nd sundering the Nandor (Q. for \"those who go back\") split off from the Teleri; over time therefore their language deviates from the Old Telerin tongue, and forms the Nandorin language. The Nandor then split once more as the Laiquendi go west, and later their dialects drift apart: thus East Danian and West Danian.\n\n\"Silvan Elvish\" is itself an umbrella term for the various dialects of Elvish spoken by various groups of Elves in later Ages. These languages descend from the East Danian dialect(s), but are not synonymous with it/them, because they don't coexist: East Danian refers to the language of the eastern Nandor in the 1st Age , \"Silvan Elvish\" is a term applicable to the 2nd & 3rd. Furthermore, the Silvan Elvish tongues are noted to have been influenced by Avarin tongues, brought by Avarin peoples who migrated westwards over time and mingled with the Silvan Elves; East Danian had no such influences (yet).\n\nTo summarise: East Danian evolved over time, with some Avarin influence, into what is later known as \"Silvan Elvish\", which is itself an umbrella term for several closely related dialects - similar to the relation between Old and Modern English.\nAs a side-note, I would be careful with saying \"Danian (from their leader Dân)\", as it is currently phrased on both of the pages you linked; this is a false assumption. The element dan- is cognate of Q. nan- in the Telerin languages, e.g. Quenya Nandor \"those who go back\" is equivalent to the Sindarin terms Danedhel, Danwaith, Danathrim. This first element comes from Primitive Elvish √NDAN.\n\nThis however seems to have nothing to do with Lenwe/Dân/Denweg: if his name was based on the same root, it would be Nenwe in Quenya, not Lenwe. In his case the element is √DAN, which is unattested and likely related to √NDAN, but distinct from it. My point is - saying \"Danian is from Dân\" is mixing up cause and effect.\n\nAnother side-note - reference #2 in both of these pages (citing PE17/153) is unnecessary and does not fit there, it should be replaced with another instance of ref #1 (PE18/78).\n===Other pages needing improvement===\n;Suggested by [[User:Sage]]\n*Rewrite essay-like articles such as [[Blue Wizards]], [[Dagor Dagorath]] and [[Later Ages]] from in-universe point of view, per the Manual of Style.\n*Disambiguate [[Day of Doom]] from [[Dagor Dagorath]], or rename the main page as [[Day of Doom]]; the Battle is a ''part'' of the Day of Doom.\n\n;Suggested by [[User:Éowyn]]\n*Oxford related articles are a mess.\n\n==Additions needed==\n;Suggested by [[User:Éowyn]]\n*[[Frodo Baggins]] needs Other versions of the legendarium section.\n*[[:Category:Letters by recipient]] only has a few people so far.\n;Suggested by [[User:Luotiansha]]\n* This page - [[Websites]] - is intended to be an index to all the useful and good websites both now and past. It is best to give a short description to each of these entries. Anyone can add entries to it.\n\n==Create==\n;Suggested by [[User:Dour1234]]\n*Create a page on \"[[J0 9184]]\", which was the license plate that both of Tolkien's cars had possessed. Some links to possible references can be found in the following post: \"[[Forums:J0 9184]]\".\n===Infoboxes===\n;suggested by [[User:IvarTheBoneless]]\n*Maybe create a super infobox for characters that magically changes its color depending of the race.\n\n==Books==\n;Suggested by [[User:Luotiansha]]\n— [https://www.tolkienguide.com/modules/wiwimod/index.php?page=Store TolkienGuide store] —\n<br>↑This, is a good place to check the upcoming books & editions. It also lists many other Tolkien-related books, if any of them does not currently have a page on TolkienGateway, hey, you know what to do.\n<br><br>— [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1812QgCHT0FCwIpDVAzXJemtcp40KNo7ro0GnZbKtZgg/edit?usp=sharing A HarperCollins books sheet] —\n<br>↑A google sheet of HarperCollins books, could be useful for reference. ([https://www.reddit.com/r/tolkienbooks/comments/vngd3x/isbn_groupings_for_recentish_harpercollins_books/ source])\n\n\n==Some priorities==\n;Suggested by [[User:LorenzoCB]]\n*''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''\n**All articles citing it should include pagination of the [[The Lord of the Rings (50th Anniversary Edition)|50th Anniversary Edition]].\n**All articles of [[Poems in The Lord of the Rings]] need better references and an explanation of their context.\n**<s>[[Eye of Sauron]] deserves its own article, which should be divided in the appareance of Sauron and his heraldic device.</s>\n*''[[Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth]]''\n**All articles citing it should include pagination.\n**Many of its chapters are stubs or need a better synopsis.\n*''[[The Silmarillion]]''\n**Analysis of Christopher's editorial work on each chapter. Not about the evolution of his father's work, but a simplification of what is explained in ''[[Arda Reconstructed]]''.\n**Maybe articles for other sections like the Foreword, the Appendix, the [[:File:Christopher Tolkien - The Realms of the Noldor and the Sindar.jpg|Map of the Realms]] and the Tables.\n*''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''\n**Synopsis for all chapters/sections of each book. More details below.\n*''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' \n**An explanation of its composition is missing in the main article.\n**Synopsis for all the chapters of [[The Book of Lost Tales Part One|Part One]] and [[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two|Part Two]]. There are some already done, which include a synopsis of the narrative and Christopher's commentary.\n**Articles on the [[:Category:Languages in The Book of Lost Tales|languages in this phase]] are quite poor.\n**Same with the [[:Category:Races in The Book of Lost Tales|races]].\n*''[[The Lays of Beleriand]]''\n**''[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]'': the two versions of the poem can be summarized in the same article or be split in two.\n**''[[The Lay of Leithian]]'': the synopsis of the [[Cantos of the Lay of Leithian|Cantos]] need better consistency, and we should give them as chapter synopsis, rather than part of the in-universe Lay. An article for the \"Unwritten Cantos\" is needed.\n**''[[The Lay of Leithian Recommenced]]'' is a stub.\n*''[[The History of The Lord of the Rings]]'': somebody began a good synopsis of ''[[The Return of the Shadow]]'' chapters, but left it in [[Return to Hobbiton|chapter XIV]]. It would be appropiate to follow the same style.\n*''[[The Notion Club Papers]]''\n**The main article should not include a synopsis, but an overall analysis and an index that leads to the synopsis of each section.\n**Expand articles about the members of the Club: not only their description, but also their interventions in the meetings.\n**Include the dates of the Nights in the articles of [[:Category:Dates]] (as in-universe, same as the dates of the legendarium's ages).\n*[[Legendarium]]\n**Equivalences between YT-YS. Tolkien changed the number of YS in a YT, but the wiki chose one equivalence to calculate the (solar) age of Elves in the infoboxes. We should explain this in an article and justify every calculation in a note.\n**Merge the Elvish demonyms into the \"Other names\" section of their main articles, (for example, [[Apanónar]] into [[Men]]).\n**An article for the ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'' [[:Category:Books and documents within the legendarium|in-universe]] is needed, which should be done in a similar way to [[Ainulindalë (Rúmil's work)]], including [[Quenta Silmarillion (disambiguation)|all the versions]].\n**Merge [[:Category:Books and documents within the legendarium]] and [[:Category:Lays and tales within the legendarium]] and create a [Category:Literary works within the legendarium].\n**[[Awakening of the Elves]]\n**[[Light of Valinor]]\n**[[Round World version of the Silmarillion]]\n**Clarify the terms [[Teleri]] and [[Falathrim]]. Somebody began applying the term \"Falathrim\" to the Teleri in Aman, but it was done poorly.\n**Merge [[fëa and hröa]] into [[Incarnate]].\n*[[Languages]]\n**Upload all kind of [[runes]] in a way they can be applied for the English use and the different modes of Cirth.\n**[[New English Alphabet]]\n**Revise the main articles for each language, including earlier versions.\n**Revise all the articles of [[:C:Elvish words]]:\n***Correct article name: many times articles were created without taking into account lenition rules (for example, ''aearon'' instead of ''gaearon'').\n***Proper differentiation between early/later Elvish, specially Gnomish/Noldorin/Sindarin.\n***References (preferably primary, such as ''The Silmarillion'' appendix, no need to overcharge an article with every single work in which the word appears).\n***Etymology section that includes the root, if exists.\n***Examples section without references, but with a link to other articles.\n***Cognates section, if any.\n**Upload better quality [[:Category:Images of Tengwar|images of Tengwar]]\n*Synopsis of books unrelated to the [[legendarium]]:\n**''[[The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún]]'': each poem needs its own article.\n**''[[The Fall of Arthur]]'': the poem needs a synopsis somewhere.\n**''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl and Sir Orfeo]]'': each text needs its own article.\n**\"[[On Fairy-Stories]]\" is a stub.\n*Update and clean up all the indexes ([[:Category:Index]])\n**Clean up [[Index:Writings by year]], and probably move it to \"Index:Tolkien studies publications by year\" or something like that.\n*Life of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]\n**Full original article for his life, with references!\n**[[Oxford]]\n*Clean up all the stub tags accumulated by [[:Category:The Lord of the Rings (film series) scenes]]\n*Make a more detailed list of TG's bibliography.\n*Lots of journal issues waiting to be created (not just the most recent numbers!):\n**''[[Mallorn (journal)|Mallorn]]''\n**''[[Amon Hen (journal)|Amon Hen]]''\n**''[[Lembas (journal)|Lembas]]'' (Extra)\n**''[[Mythlore]]''\n**''[[SEVEN]]''\n\n::Good summary! A note: some years ago we discussed page references to UT, and found that the pagination is not consistent in the different editions (unlike the Houghton Mifflin/HarperCollins HoME, and works that have a \"standard\" edition like LotR). I therefore made an expanded citation template for UT, since there are several divisions and sub-divisions in the book. But perhaps there are new reasons to start including page references to UT as well? --[[User:Morgan|Morgan]] 22:29, 4 August 2022 (UTC)\n\n:::Christopher Tolkien uses UT pagination constantly thoughtout HOME, so using the same as him is perfectly consistent with what we already have. I've always included pages when citing UT, aware that it was the same as the one used by Christopher. Expanding the citation template was useful nontheless, but having the more precise references, the better. --[[User:LorenzoCB|LorenzoCB]] 12:53, 5 August 2022 (UTC)\n\n[[Category:Tolkien Gateway:To-do|{{PAGENAME}}]]"}}}
