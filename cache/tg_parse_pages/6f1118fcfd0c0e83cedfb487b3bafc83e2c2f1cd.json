Tolkien and [[Edith Bratt]] were reunited on [[January 8]], [[1913]] - and after a separation of three years, Tolkien asked Edith to marry him.<ref name=\"Celb\"/>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Cities, towns and villages]]\n[[Category:Gnomish locations]]\n[[Category:Locations in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Tol Eressëa]]"}}}
