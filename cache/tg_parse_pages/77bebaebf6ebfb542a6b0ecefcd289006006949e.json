During the battle Bandobras, who was large enough to ride a horse, charged at Golfimbul and knocked off his head with a club. Golfimbul's head flew through the air for 100 yards and went down a rabbit hole. It is said that this is how the game of [[golf]] was invented.<ref name=\"HParty\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nJim Allan suggests that ''Golfimbul'' has a Scandinavian origin, means \"Wind-terrible\" and contains the elements ''Gol-'' (\"wind\") and ''Fimbul'' (\"might\" or \"great\").<ref>{{HM|IE}}, Giving of Names, p. 226</ref>\n\n\"Fimbul\" is Old Norse for \"great\".<ref>[[Wikipedia:Fimbulwinter#Etymology]]</ref>\n\n[[Robert Foster]] notes that the connection with the English word \"golf\" suggests that the name is either fictitious or translated [[Westron]].<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 167</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nAt an early stage in writing ''[[The Hobbit]]'' [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] used the name '''[[Fingolfin]]''' for the Goblin-leader, which also contained the word \"golf\" for the joke about the origin of the game (although not as prominently as in \"Golfimbul\").<ref>{{HH|Bladorthin}}, p. 39</ref> Many years later, in the never-finished 1960 rewrite of the story, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] intended to change the name to '''Gulfimbul'''.<ref>{{HH|NC1}}, p. 776</ref> [[John D. Rateliff]] speculated that this was either a further evolution of Tolkien's languages or because he was dropping the golf-joke reference.<ref>{{HH|NC1}}, note 24, p. 785</ref> The 1960 revision was an effort to \"upgrade\" ''The Hobbit'' to the same epic level as ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Films===\n'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''\n:In trying to convince [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] of his [[Tooks|Tookishness]], [[Gandalf]] tells about the story of the [[Battle of Greenfields]], referring to Golfimbul as a Goblin-king.\n\n===Games===\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:In [[Brockenborings]] there is a wooden statue depicting Bandobras standing in a golf pose over Golfimbul's head. Every Spring, [[the Shire]] celebrates Bullroarer Took Day when the Hobbits place tankards of the drink under his statue in his honor.\n\n:The epic book prologue in the Shire involves the player trying to thwart '''Lubach''', who believes that he is the descendant of Golfimbul, from invading the Shire with a group of Goblins. He dwells in a landmark in the Greenfields referred to as '''Golfimbul's Hole'''.\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Golfimbul}}\n\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n| name=Golfimbul\n| race=orc\n| house=\n| born=\n| died={{TA|2747}}\n}}\n{{seq\n| prev=unknown\n| list=King of the [[Goblins]] of [[Mount Gram]]\n| dates=unknown - {{TA|2747}}\n| next=unknown (possibly none)\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n\n[[Category:Characters in The Hobbit]]\n[[Category:Orcs]]\n[[Category:Rulers in Middle-earth]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[de:Golfimbul]]\n[[fi:Golfimbul]]"}}}
