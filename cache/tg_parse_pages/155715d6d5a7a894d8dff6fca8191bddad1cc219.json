During that retreat [[Huor]] formed a rearguard south of the Fen of Serech and resisted until all of his men but one were slain.  That one was [[Húrin]] who was captured and then taken to [[Angband]].<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>\n\n[[Glaurung]] the [[Dragons|dragon]] came through the Pass of Sirion and defiled the waters of the [[Eithel Ivrin]] on his way to [[Nargothrond]].<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Passes]]"}}}
