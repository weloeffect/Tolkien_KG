He was invented by [[Iron Crown Enterprises]] for ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]''. He has brownish-red scales and measures fifty-five feet in length.\n\nWhen he escaped the doom of Angband as a young dragon, a North Bear almost killed him. This instilled a deep hatred of bears into the dragon. Likewise, [[Northmen|Northman]] Bear-cults view him as their ancient enemy. Beyond Bears, Bairanax has a rivalry with the dragon [[Lomaw]].\n\nThe lair of Bairanax was situated in the caves at Ovir Hollow, surrounded by a flower-filled moat, somewhere in the southern Grey Mountains.<ref name=creatures>{{ICE|2012}}, pp. 106-107</ref> \n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Dragons from adaptations]]\n[[Category:Middle-earth Role Playing characters]]"}}}
