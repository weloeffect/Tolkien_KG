Let them pass!\n  Hill and water under sky,\n  Pass them by!

Let them go!\n  Sand and stone and pool and dell,\n  Fare you well! Fare you well!\n\nHome is behind, the world ahead,\nAnd there are many paths to tread\nThrough shadows to the edge of night,\nUntil the stars are all alight.\nThen world behind and home ahead,\nWe'll wander back to home and bed.\n  Mist and twilight, cloud and shade,\n  Away shall fade! Away shall fade!\n  Fire and lamp, and meat and bread,\n  And then to bed! And then to bed!\n</poem>\n\nAs the song ended, a tired Pippin re-sang the last line but changed it to match his desire for rest: \"And ''now'' to bed!
