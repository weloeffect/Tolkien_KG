Orcs from the Grey Mountains move south through the trees, Giant Spiders congregate in larger numbers, and Trolls emerge from their caves more frequently. \n\nSeveral lads and lasses of Ulgarstat, a hamlet at the forest's edge and due west of Lake-town, have disappeared without a trace. Will you risk unknown dangers to find and rescue the missing youths in Attercop Attack? \n\nA merchant based in Lake town has lost a caravan to Trolls along the Men-i-Naugrim. Will you face the dread Tereg to recover Master Eolsen's goods and discover the fate of his hirelings in Trouble With Trolls? \n\nA Beorning warrior has learned of a tithe to the Necromancer from the last of the Orcs he slew while traveling though Mirkwood. Will you accompany Grimbold into the forest to waylay the treasure before it enters the Necromancer's citadel in The Tithing Train? \n\nCombat Giant Spiders, Trolls, Orcs of Fhahoz-Blogrum when you attack the Denizens of the Dark Wood in these three exiting adventures.\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:MERP]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
