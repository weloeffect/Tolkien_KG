He forgets nothing; and he knows all things that shall be, save only those that lie still in the freedom of [[Ilúvatar]]. He is the Doomsman of the [[Valar]].|''[[The Silmarillion]]'', \"[[Valaquenta]]: Of the Valar\"}}\n\n'''Mandos''' was the '''Doomsman of the Valar''' who pronounced judgement in matters of fate. He was the keeper of the slain in his [[Halls of Mandos|Halls]] in the west of [[Valinor]]. \n\nHis actual, less common name was '''''Námo'''''. He was the \"elder brother\" of the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Irmo]] (also called ''Lórien''). He is one of the [[Aratar]]. Together, Mandos and Irmo are called the [[Fëanturi]] ([[Quenya|Q]]: \"Masters of Spirits\"). Their sister is [[Nienna]]. [[Vairë]] the Weaver is his wife. \n\n==Attributes==\nHe keeps the [[Halls of Mandos]] where he summons the spirits of the slain. For this he is also known as \"Mandos\" after his dwelling place.<ref name=vala>{{S|IIb}}</ref> \n\nMandos knows and remembers nearly all things that were and shall be. He serves as the Doomsman of the Valar, he pronounces his judgements at the bidding of [[Manwë]]. However only [[Ilúvatar]] knows with full certainty what the full doom of Arda will be, and he will not reveal it all, even to Mandos or Manwë.<ref name=vala/> Mandos and Manwë have always been allied since their entering into [[Eä]], and together they understand most clearly the [[Vision of Ilúvatar]] more than any of the other Valar.\n \nMandos is said to be the grimmest of the Valar. However, this in no way implies that Mandos is dark or evil.  His grimness is wholly part of his nature, coming (one must assume) from that part of the mind of [[Ilúvatar]] from which he came. Neither is Mandos willful or malevolent in declaring the fates of [[Arda]].\n\n==History==\nDuring one of the early councils of the Valar, the Powers worried that the [[Elves]] would come in darkness. Manwë bid Mandos to speak, and he revealed that the age of the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] approached and it was the doom of the [[Elves]] to wake under the [[stars]] and revere [[Varda]]. This prompted Varda to prepare new stars for the [[Awakening of the Elves]].<ref name=\"Coming\">{{S|3}}</ref>\n\nAfter [[Morgoth|Melkor]] was overthrown in the [[Battle of the Powers]], the Valar debated on whether to summon the [[Elves]] to [[Aman]]. Though some such as [[Ulmo]] felt the Elves should be left to dwell in Middle-earth, the Valar decided to summon the Elves. At this, Mandos broke his silence with the words \"So it is doomed\".<ref name=\"Coming\"/>\n\nWhen the unrest of the Noldor began and Fëanor drew sword upon Fingolfin, Mandos was present at the council when Fëanor was interrogated for his actions. Though it was revealed that Melkor had sown the seed of dissent, Mandos would not allow Fëanor's haughty actions to go unpunished. Therefore he banished Fëanor from Tirion for 12 years, only allowing him to return if one should release him. At which point, Fingolfin offered to do so.\n\nBut after Melkor slew the Trees of Valinor and stole the Silmarils, Fëanor was overcome with rage and led the [[Noldor]] in rebellion against the Valar. Driven by their Oath, Fëanor's host carried out the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë|Kinslaying]] at [[Alqualondë]] in the lands of [[Araman]] north of Valinor. For this act Mandos, or one of his servants, pronounced the [[Doom of Mandos]], a warning if they continued in their rebellion. This caused [[Finarfin]] to repent and return to [[Eldamar]].<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref> The curse of Mandos remained upon all the Noldor, tied to the [[Oath of Fëanor]] and thwarting the Noldor in all the [[Wars of Beleriand]].\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Lúthien's Lament Before Mandos.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Lúthien's Lament Before Mandos'']]\nWhen [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] died, she sang a song of such extraordinary power and beauty that it moved even the implacable heart of Mandos. Deeming that this matter was beyond him, yet unable to reverse the fates, Mandos sought the counsel of Manwë. In turn, Manwë gave him the response from Ilúvatar. Mandos returned to Lúthien and gave her a choice; to remain in Valinor forever and forget all her griefs, or to return with Beren to Middle-earth as a mortal. Luthien chose the latter, forsaking her immortality. So Beren was returned to a second life and Lúthien was granted a unique fate, to become mortal and return to [[Middle-earth]] with him.\n\nAfter, when [[Eärendil]] set foot in [[Aman]] and begged the Valar for the forgiveness of the [[Noldor]] and help in their war with [[Morgoth]], he was the one who demanded he be executed for no mortal should set foot in Aman and live. But [[Ulmo]] spoke against him, asking whether he was the son of [[Tuor]] of the [[Edain]] or [[Idril]] of the Noldor. Mandos responded that in either case, since the Noldor are still under the ban, he should not live. Regardless of that, [[Manwë]] answered his prayer and commanded the [[Host of the Valar]] be assembled and wage war on Morgoth. Considering Eärendil's doom, along with [[Elwing]]'s, his wife, he offered them and their children a choice: whether to be counted among [[Elves]] or [[Men]].<ref>{{S|24}}</ref> After the [[War of Wrath]], the exiled Noldor were forgiven and the Curse of Mandos was ended.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Námo'' (pron. {{IPA|[ˈnaːmo]}}) in [[Quenya]] means \"Judge\" or \"Ordainer\",<ref>{{PE|21}}, p. 85</ref> from [[root]] [[NAM]].\n\n''Mandos'' ({{IPA|[ˈmandos]}}) is a [[Quenya]] name meaning \"Castle of Custody\".<ref>{{MR|P4k}}, p. 350</ref> It derived from the early Elvish ''Mandostŏ''.<ref>{{VT|39a}}, p. 6</ref> \n\nIn the previous ''[[Etymologies]]'', ''Mandos'' was translated as \"Imprisoner, Binder\", derived from [[root]] [[MBAD]]. Note that here, ''Mando'' was envisioned as the actual name of the Vala proper (not his realm). In that conception, the form ''Mand-os'' (from ''Mand-osse'') is a \"lengthened\" form  meaning \"''Dread'' Imprisoner\".<ref name=Etymologies>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry \"MBAD-\"</ref> The [[Noldorin]] names for ''Mandos'' were '''''Bannos''''' (\"Dread Imprisoner\"\") and '''''Badhor'''''/'''''Badhron''''' (\"judge\").<ref>{{VT|45a}}, p. 33</ref>\n\nIn [[Eriol]]'s [[Old English]] translations, Mandos is referred as ''Nefrea'' \"Corpse-ruler\" and ''neoaerna hlaford'' \"master of the houses  of  the  dead\".<ref>{{SM|QA1}}</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| | | | | |,|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| VAI |~| MAN | | NIE | | IRM |~| EST | |VAI=[[Vairë]]|MAN='''MANDOS'''|NIE=[[Nienna]]|IRM=[[Irmo]]|EST=[[Estë]]}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n[[Christopher Tolkien]] notes that in the early version of the [[Legendarium]] Mandos does exclaim prophecies, but he doesn't function as the \"Doomsman of the Valar\" as in the later ''[[Silmarillion]]''.<ref name=lt13n>{{LT1|IIIn}}</ref> His wife was [[Nienna#Other versions of the Legendarium|Fui Nienna]] and he had a [[hound]] named [[Gorgumoth]].\n\nIn the ''[[Qenya Lexicon]]'' the Vala in [[Qenya]] was called Ve or Vefantur Mandos. In the ''[[Gnomish Lexicon]]'' his [[Gnomish]] names are Bannoth Gwi, Gwi-fanthor and Gwivannoth. His personal name(s) ''Ve''/''Gwi'' are said to derive from a primitive [[root]] VEHE, but no meaning or translation are given.<ref name=ltapp/> \n\n''Mandos'' is the Qenya name of the region and their Halls, also known as ''Ve'' after him. The Gnomish form ''Bannoth'' also refers to the Vala and the region of the souls, but also improperly his Halls (properly ''Gwi'' or ''Ingwi'').<ref name=ltapp>{{LT1|Appendix}}</ref>\n\nAn epithet of Mandos was '''''Morimando''''' (\"Dark Mando\"), being the dark counterpart of Manwë ''Kalamando'' (\"Light Mando\"). Tolkien notes that in those epithets, the element ''man'' loses its sense as \"doom, prison\", and is understood as the root referring to \"holiness\" (root MAN in ''Man''we).<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry MBAD</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nMandos is comparable to gods of the dead of real world mythologies, like Hades or Hel. The instance of Lúthien singing to him in order to release her beloved, is reminiscent of similar ancient tales, such as Orpheus singing to Hades to release Eurydice, or Hermod who asks Hel to release Baldur.<ref>{{webcite|author=Dawn Felagund|articleurl=http://www.silmarillionwritersguild.org/reference/references/pf/namo2.php|articlename=Námo Mandos|website=[http://www.silmarillionwritersguild.org Silmarillion Writers Guild]}}</ref> (The story of Orpheus has been retold in English literature as ''[[Sir Orfeo]]'').\n\nAnother similarity shared between Mandos and the two mythological figures, is that they bear the name of their realms. Mandos in the early writings had a hound, [[Gorgumoth]], while Hades was guarded by the monstrous dog Cerberus and Hel by the dog or wolf Garmr.\n\n{{References}}\n{{Ainur}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mandos}}\n[[Category:Aratar]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Qenya names]]\n[[Category:Quenya names]]\n\n[[de:Mandos (Person)]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/ainur/valar/aratar/mandos]]\n[[fi:Námo]]"}}}
