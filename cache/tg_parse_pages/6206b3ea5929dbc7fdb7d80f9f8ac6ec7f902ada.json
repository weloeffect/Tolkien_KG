Tolkien]] with the permission of the [[Tolkien Estate]].\n\nHis ''Epic Scenes from The Silmarillion after the mythology of J.R.R. Tolkien -'' a cycle of operatic works originally written between 1980 and 1994  consisted of ''[[Fëanor, Op. 46 (Opera)|Op. 46 - Fëanor]]'', ''[[Beren and Lúthien, Op. 47 (Opera)|Op. 47. Beren and Lúthien]]'', ''[[The Children of Húrin, Op. 48 (Opera)|Op. 48 - The Children of Húrin]]'' and ''[[The Fall of Gondolin, Op.49 (Opera)|Op. 49 - The Fall of Gondolin]].''  The libretti for these works were compiled with the assistance of Christopher Tolkien who supplied Godfrey with, at that point in time, unpublished versions of some of the texts to help expand the words of ''The Silmarillion'' into a more dramatic form.  \n\n[[Priscilla Tolkien]] hosted an event for [[The Tolkien Society]] in 1982 where a small ensemble of singers performed highlights from ''The Children of Húrin'' to the assembled members at the [[Oxonmoot]]. Priscilla herself joined the choir for the occasion. \n\nThe operas sat unperformed until 2018 when Volante Opera Productions undertook the process of creating demo recordings of the works. During this process, Godfrey was persuaded to compose a final part to ''The Silmarillion'' to finish off the tales which was subsequently recorded. This fifth and final part was entitled ''[[The War of Wrath, Op. 71 (Opera)|Op. 71. The War of Wrath]]'' was completed in 2020.\n\nIn total, the cycle has a duration of approximately ten and a half hours, has a cast of 48 characters and 55 scenes.\n\nIn 2024 the Tolkien Estate also granted the rights to his operatic cycles [[Musical chapters from The Lord of the Rings after the mythology of J. R. R. Tolkien, Op. 73]] and [[Musical Chapters from The Hobbit after the mythology of J. R. R. Tolkien, Op. 8]]. In May 2025, [[Musical chapters from The Lord of the Rings]] was made avaiable for pre-order.<ref>https://www.volanteopera.wales/product-page/15-cd-album-of-musical-chapter-from-the-lord-of-the-rings</ref> The work will be released on 5 September 2025.<ref>https://www.theonering.net/torwp/2025/05/05/120390-exclusive-lord-of-the-rings-opera-available-for-pre-order/</ref>\n\nOther authorised works include ''[[Tolkien Songs, Op. 9|Op. 9 - Tolkien Songs]]'', ''[[Shadow-Bride, Op. 36 (Song)|Op. 33 - Shadow-Bride]]'', ''[[Symphony No. 3 Ainulindalë, Op. 42|Op. 36 - Symphony No. 3 Ainulindalë]]'', ''[[Akallabêth (for solo piano), Op. 42|Op. 42 - Akallabêth (for solo piano)]]'', ''[[Akallabêth (for orchestra), Op. 42a|Op. 42a - Akallabêth (for Orchestra)]]'' and ''[[Daeron, Op. 45 (Flute and Piano)|Op. 45 - Daeron]].''
