On the north bank of the Pool there was a row of [[Smials]] with water-side gardens. From the middle of the village, [[South Lane]] led to Cotton’s farm. South from the East Road ran the road north to [[Hobbiton]], lined by an avenue of trees. The village had its own post office.\n\nIn {{TA|3018}}, the Shire was taken over by [[Saruman]] and his [[Ruffians]]. A year later many houses in Bywater stood empty and some had even been burnt. At the return of [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and his companions, Bywater became the centre of the rebellion, with the [[Travellers]] rousing the [[Shire-folk]]  on [[2 September]], which ultimately ended with the [[Battle of Bywater]] and the liberation of the Shire.<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name refers to it as being beside the [[Bywater Pool|pool]] occurring in the course of [[the Water]].<ref name=\"Nomen\">{{HM|N}}, p. 767</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''\n:The villages of Hobbiton and Bywater were merged in the film so that The Green Dragon was put on the other side of the water from [[Bag End]] facing [[Old Mill|Sandyman's Mill]].\n\n'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''\n:Bywater is the second town encountered by the player.
