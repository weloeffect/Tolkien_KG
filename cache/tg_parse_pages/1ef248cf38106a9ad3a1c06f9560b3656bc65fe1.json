It is said there to lie in the \"Burning south\" (of [[Beleriand]]),<ref>{{LB|1b}} lines 223, 425</ref> which might suggest it was a different \"Dorwinion\", or may just have referred to the fact it came from the more southern lands of  [[Rhovanion]] by way of the [[Dwarf-road of Beleriand]].\n\nWhile writing the [[Quenta Silmarillion]], Tolkien once mentioned Dorwinion as a location of [[Tol Eressëa]].<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, p. 338</ref> Tolkien reused the name and the wines in ''[[The Hobbit]]'', establishing thus that it is somewhere in or near [[Rhovanion|Wilderland]].\n\nIn annotations to [[Pauline Baynes]], Tolkien suggested the name ''Mildor'' meaning \"Land of wines\", and it was struck out.<ref>{{webcite|author=Daniel Helen|articleurl=https://www.tolkiensociety.org/2015/11/tolkiens-annotated-map-of-middle-earth-transcribed/|articlename=Tolkien’s annotated map of Middle-earth transcribed|dated=10 November 2015|website=The Tolkien Society|accessed=24 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nBased on the meaning of its name, [[John Rateliff]] suggests that the name is a reference to the Irish legend of [[Wikipedia:Tír na nÓg|Tír na nÓg]] \"Land of the Young\". However this similarity rather applies to the earlier phase where Dorwinion was mentioned as a part of Tol Eressea.<ref>{{HH|Halls}}, (v) ''The Wine of Dorwinion''</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:While Dorwinion itself does not appear in the game, [[Easterlings]] from that land are encountered as refugees in the [[Dale]]-lands. The Men of Dorwinion are said to have fled from a disaster in the East that occurred following the downfall of [[Sauron]]. They are notably more friendly towards the Westlands than other Easterling tribes and have had trade relations in the past with Dale and the Woodland Realm.
