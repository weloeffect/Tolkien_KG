Since the Free Fair is septennial, Will must have been Mayor since the last Fair before {{TA|3020}} (3020-7={{TA|3013|n}}). However, as we are not told that was his first term, it's possible that he might already been serving since {{TA|3006}} or even earlier. See {{HM|Guide}}, p. 428, entry \"Will Whitfoot\".</ref>\n\nHe was renowned as being the fattest hobbit in the [[Westfarthing]], and was affectionately referred to as \"Flourdumpling\" after he emerged from the collapse of the [[Town Hole]] covered in chalk. [[Peregrin Took]] later caused a great deal of laughter at the [[Prancing Pony]] when he related that incident to the [[Bree-folk]].<ref>{{FR|I9}}</ref> \n\nHe was one of the first victims of the new rule of [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]] and [[Sharkey]]. He went to protest against Lotho's felling of trees, but was apprehended by [[Ruffians]] on his way to [[Bag End]]. He was locked up in the [[Lockholes]], and Lotho usurped his title.<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref> He was freed after the [[Battle of Bywater]], but was at first unfit for duty as Mayor, so [[Frodo Baggins]] served as Deputy Mayor.<ref>{{RK|Havens}}</ref> He was officially restored as Mayor on the next Free Fair, on [[Midyear's Day]] of {{SR|1420}}.<ref name=\"Later\">{{App|Later}}</ref>\n\nWill Whitfoot resigned in {{SR|1427}}, and was succeeded by [[Samwise Gamgee]].<ref name=\"Later\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Whitfoot\" is derived from \"White foot\".<ref>{{HM|N}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Will Whitfood in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Will Whitfoot.jpg|Will Whitfoot in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Mayor Will Whitfoot can be found in the centre of [[Michel Delving]].
