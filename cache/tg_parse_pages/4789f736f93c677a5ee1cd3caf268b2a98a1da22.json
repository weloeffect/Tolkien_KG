Tolkien''''' refers to the title of an article which includes extracts from an interview with [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. The interview was conducted by Henry Resnik over the telephone, for the magazine the ''Saturday Evening Post'' (published in [[Saturday Evening Post (2 July 1966)|the issue of 2 July 1966]]). The interview was perhaps conducted on [[2 March]] [[1966]] and according to Resnik they spoke for about half an hour. According to [[Clyde S. Kilby]], Tolkien disliked the published article and had hung up on Resnik.<ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 657</ref> Kilby also explains that Tolkien denied to have said some affirmations about [[Middle-earth]] being Europe, although these do not seem to be false per se.<ref>[[Clyde S.
