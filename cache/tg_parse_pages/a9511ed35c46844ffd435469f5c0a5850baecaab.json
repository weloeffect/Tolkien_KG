Also, the Society participates in the [[International Tolkien Fellowship]] and its members are often present in Tolkien events over Europe. \n\nIn October [[2007]], the GTS hosted the first overboard Tolkien gathering on Greek ground on the island of [[Wikipedia:Andros|Andros]] with [[Marcel Bülles]] chairman of the [[German Tolkien Society]] and [[Caspar Reiff]] of ''[[Tolkien Ensemble]]'' as special guests. The happening was conveniently named \"Cair Andros\".\n==External links==\n* [http://www.tolkien.gr Official website]\n* [http://cairandros.gr/ Cair Andros page]\n*[http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=8774063173 Facebook group]\n[[Category:Greek organizations]]\n[[Category:Tolkien Societies]]"}}}
