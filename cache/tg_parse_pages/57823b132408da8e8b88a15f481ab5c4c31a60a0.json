He was a [[Gondorian]] who was in charge of the [[Houses of Healing]].\n\n==History==\nNot much is said of him, and no name has been given to this character.\n\nWhen [[Éowyn]] has been healed (at least bodily-wise), the Warden counselled her to take rest for at least a week from now, but Éowyn was determined to go beyond the Houses of Healing, and in one of her wanderings she met [[Faramir]], and conversing with him for a while, she set all the dreams of her past deeds to naught. And so began the love of Faramir the [[Steward of Gondor]] and Éowyn the [[Shieldmaiden of Rohan]].<ref name=\"Steward\">{{RK|VI5}}</ref>\n\nAt that tidings the Warden of the Houses of Healing was rejoiced, and his heart was uplifted.<ref name=\"Steward\" />\n\n==Notes==\n*'''Warden of the Houses of Healing''' was the title given to the chief healer of the [[Houses of Healing]] in [[Minas Tirith]], a position of some power and authority.<ref name=\"Warden\">{{RK|V8}}</ref>\n*Although the title of the '''Warden of the Houses of Healing''' refers to a broader category, the '''Warden of the Houses of Healing''' in ''The Return of the King'' is, no doubt, an individual character.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2015: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The position of the Warden of the Houses of Healing is occupied by a man called '''Torchún''', who is one of the many Wardens sitting on the [[Council of Gondor]]. Before the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] he is concerned about gathering as many goods and supplies for his healers as possible. After the battle, he asks the player to assist in both helping the countless wounded as well as driving away numerous well-wishers and visitors who crowd the place.\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Warden of the Houses of Healing}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:Gondorians]]\n[[Category:Mannish titles]]\n[[Category:Positions and occupations]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]"}}}
