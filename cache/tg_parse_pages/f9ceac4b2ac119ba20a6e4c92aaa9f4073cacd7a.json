Chetwood South was located around the [[East Road]] south of [[Staddle]], south-east of [[Bree]] and south-west of the [[Midgewater Marshes]]. Chetwood North was north of the marsh, between [[Combe]] and the [[Weather Hills]]. The Far Chetwood lay in the northeast of Bree-land beyond the [[Archet]] Dale, south of the lake of Nen Harn on the border with the [[North Downs]].
