It is not counted among the major battles of the [[First Age]], and it ended in the destruction of the [[Falas]] and the death of many [[Elves]].\n\n==History==\nAfter the Nírnaeth, the servants of Morgoth roamed the north freely and those that survived the battle fled south. [[Círdan]], the lord of the Falas, received many refugees and sent mariners to harass the enemy whenever they came near the coast. The two havens of the Falas, [[Brithombar]] and [[Eglarest]], were strong, and their walls were high.<ref name=\"TSNA\">{{S|20}}</ref>\n\nA year later, in the autumn, Morgoth sent a great force over [[Hithlum]] and [[Nevrast]].  His armies ravaged the countryside as they went, laying siege to Brithombar and Eglarest.  The Elves resisted valiantly, but in the armies of Morgoth were 'skilled smiths, miners and masters of fire' who built mighty siege-engines which broke the walls.  [[Barad Nimras]] was cast down, and most of the elves were killed and enslaved.  But Círdan himself escaped with a remnant, including the [[Noldor]]in prince [[Gil-galad|Ereinion Gil-galad]], aboard the ships.  They sailed to the [[Isle of Balar]] and continued to welcome refugees, but the Falas were no more.<ref name=\"TSNA\"/>\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Conflicts of the First Age]]\n[[Category:Falas]]"}}}
