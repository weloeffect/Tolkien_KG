That is a mighty matter of legend, though you tread it under the light of day!|[[Aragorn]] in ''[[The Two Towers]]'', \"[[The Riders of Rohan]]\"}}\n'''Middle-earth''' ([[Quenya|Q.]] ''[[Endor]]'') was a large continent of [[Arda]], situated between [[Aman]] to the [[Uttermost West|West]] (across [[Belegaer]]), and the [[Uttermost East|Land of the Sun]] to the [[East]] (across the [[East Sea]]). \n\nMost of the history of Arda takes place in Middle-earth, and it was where the [[Children of Ilúvatar]]: the [[Elves]] and [[Men]], came into being, along with the [[Dwarves]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[Image:Sage - Middle-earth.png|thumb|left|The northern regions of Middle-earth as envisioned by [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] in ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'']]\nMiddle-earth is a large continent, a mass of land that occupies the central regions of Arda. It originally lay between two continents: Aman, the uttermost West, separated from Middle-earth by the ocean Belegaer, and the Land of the Sun, the uttermost East, separated by the East Sea.\n\nIn the [[Elder Days]], the two large inland seas of [[Sea of Helcar|Helcar]] and [[Sea of Ringil|Ringil]], created by the demise of the [[Two Lamps]], were located to the north and south of the center of middle-earth.\n\nThe [[Westlands]] are the most well-known regions of the continent, and the only regions which have been mapped in great detail. Of the Westlands, the western portion called [[Beleriand]] was drowned at the end of the [[First Age]] and those who survived relocated to [[Lindon]] and [[Eriador]], which was separated from Beleriand by the [[Blue Mountains]]. Another region of the Westlands was  [[Rhovanion]]''',''' separated from Eriador by the [[Misty Mountains]]. \n\nThe southern portion of the Westlands was around [[Bay of Belfalas|a large bay]], including [[Belfalas]] the fief of [[Gondor]], and [[Near Harad]] (\"Near South\").\n\nDuring the [[Third Age]] before their decline, the sister kingdoms of [[Arnor]] and Gondor dominated the Westlands. Arnor was the northern kingdom of the two, and Gondor the southern.\n\nLittle is known about the East and South of Middle-earth, other than names such as [[Rhûn]] and [[Khand]], found east of [[Mordor]], and the '''[[Far Harad]]''' (Far South); although their size is unknown. Another name of the East was the [[Empty Lands]]. \n\nThrough the distant north-east of Middle-earth ran the [[Orocarni|Red Mountains]], and to the distant south-east the [[Yellow Mountains]], which mirrored the Blue Mountains and the [[Grey Mountains (ancient)|Grey Mountains]] of the north-west and south-west respectively. The cradle of the Elves, '''[[Cuiviénen]]''' was located on the shores of the Sea of Helcar near the Red Mountains. In the far east between the Red Mountains and the Yellow Mountains were the [[Mountains of the Wind]], and between these mountains and the easternmost shores of Middle-earth stood '''[[Hildórien]]''', the cradle of Men. There was also a mythical [[Last Desert]] in the \"East of East\", however its status or existence during the later years was unknown.\n\n==History==\n:''This is the geographical history. For events happening in Middle-earth, see [[Timeline]].''\n[[File:Steven White Jr. - Early Arda.jpg|thumb|left|Early Arda]]\n[[Aulë]] built the world amidst the [[Ekkaia|Encircling Sea]]. To the [[North]], the [[Valar]] set the lamp of [[Illuin]], and to the [[South]], the lamp of [[Ormal]], and their light mingled in the middle of the continent, occupied by the island [[Almaren]], the dwelling of the Valar.<ref>{{S|1}}</ref>\n\nArda was initially flat and symmetrical until a [[First War|titanic struggle]] between the [[Valar]] and [[Morgoth]] created several seas and formed a landmass in the centre of Arda, the earliest form of what would later be known as the [[Great Lands]] of Middle-earth. Major geographical features of that landmass were two central inland seas: the Sea of Helcar in the north and the Sea of Ringil in the south. Around them, massive mountain ranges were formed, the Blue Mountains and Red Mountains to the north, and the [[Grey Mountains]] and [[Yellow Mountains]] to the south. The [[Mountains of the Wind]] were a smaller range in the East, located south of the [[Red Mountains]] and north of the [[Yellow Mountains]].<ref name=\"SM|Ambar\">{{SM|Ambar}}</ref>\n\nEventually the Valar left the Great Lands for the [[Uttermost West]], leaving Morgoth and his creatures in his fortress at [[Utumno]], behind the [[Iron Mountains]] in the north of Middle-earth. Morgoth would later erect the [[Misty Mountains]] between the Blue Mountains and Red Mountains to hinder the Vala [[Oromë]], who hunted his creatures.<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry \"Misty Mountains\"</ref> During the [[Battle of the Powers]], the Sea of Ringil would merge with the East Sea, separating Middle-earth from a new continent to its south-east known as the [[Dark Land]]. To the west the shores of the Great Sea advanced upon the land as well, forming the [[Great Gulf]] dividing the lands of [[Beleriand]] from the lands of the south.<ref name=\"SM|Ambar\" />\n[[File:Sage - Beleriand and Eriador collage.png|thumb|[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]]'s drawing of western Middle-earth showing a deluged Beleriand adjacent to Eriador]]\nDuring the [[First Age]], the western side of Middle-earth was called Beleriand, stretching from the Ered Luin to the great ocean of Belegaer. On the northern edge of Beleriand were the fierce Ered Engrin, the Iron Mountains. Further north was the freezing [[Dor Daedeloth]]. Southwest of the Ered Engrin was [[Hithlum]], separated from the coast of [[Lammoth]] and Belegaer by the [[Ered Lómin]], and from the rest of Beleriand to the south by the [[Ered Wethrin]]. The woven wood of [[Doriath]] rested directly south of the [[Thangorodrim]] and [[Dorthonion]], southeast of Hithlum. West of Doriath were [[Taur-en-Faroth]] and the [[Falas]], and to the east was [[Nan Elmoth]] and [[Thargelion]] before reaching the [[Ered Luin]]. South of Doriath were first the [[Andram]], then [[Arvernien]] and the [[Bay of Balar]]. East of the Bay of Balar and extending ever further south into the unknown lands were the [[Taur-im-Duinath]] and [[Ossiriand]].\n\nEast of the Ered Luin was a land surrounded by four mountain ranges: the Ered Luin to the West, the Ered Engrin to the North, the Misty Mountains to the East, and some of the [[White Mountains]] to the South. [[Eriador]] was within these boundaries. Even further East, past the Hithaeglir, was the Great River [[Anduin]], [[Palisor]], and the East Sea.\n\nAfter the First Age ended and Beleriand drowned, the geography east of the Ered Luin shifted. The Ered Luin themselves, now broken up and disfigured, marked the western border of [[Eriador]], and thence Lindon and Belegaer itself. Eriador, now the Westernmost part of Middle-earth, was bordered on the East by the Misty Mountains, which stretched south to the White Mountains and the [[Bay of Belfalas]]. Across the Misty Mountains from Eriador was Rhovanion, which extended eastwards to the [[Sea of Rhûn]] and the vast lands of Rhûn beyond. Within Rhovanion were the great forests of: [[Mirkwood]], [[Fangorn Forest]], and the many-rivered area that became known as Gondor. Eastwards was the region of Mordor, bordered on three sides by mountains. Far north of Rhovanion was the icy [[Forodwaith (lands)|Forodwaith]], and where the Great Sea had advanced at its most there was the [[Icebay of Forochel]].\n\nThe coasts of Middle-earth changed once more, in the cataclysm of the [[Downfall of Númenor]]. In many places the Great Sea advanced upon the land, but in others it shrank back. Lindon suffered a great loss of land at this time. While to the south, the eastern and southern shores of the Bay of Belfalas shrank back, pushing the city of [[Pelargir]] much farther inland. The Anduin river found new paths to the sea afterwards, forming the [[Ethir Anduin]].<ref>{{PM|Second}} p. 183</ref>\n\nLong after the [[Fourth Age]], the lands had all changed their shape. The [[Hobbits]] were said to have lingered long after in the same north-western regions east of the Sea, in what was known as the Old World.<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>\n\n==Other names==\nThe peoples called Middle-earth by several names. The Elves called the continent ''[[Endóre]]'' or ''[[Endor]]'' in [[Quenya]], meaning \"middle land\"; the [[Sindarin]] word was ''[[Ennor]]'', also used in the plural ''ennorath'': \"middle lands, lands of Middle-earth\".\n\nOther epithets of the continent were '''[[Hither Lands]]''' or '''Outer Lands''' in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'',<ref name=\"ix\">{{S|Index}}</ref> contrasted to [[Aman]] beyond the sea. On [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s earliest maps of Arda, the term \"Hither Lands\" was written across both Middle-earth and the southern continent that would eventually contain [[Harad]]. Lacking a definite name for this southern landmass, \"Hither Lands\" is occasionally used by fans.\n\nIn the ''[[Akallabêth]]'' it was also the '''Great Lands''',<ref name=\"ix\" /> since it was so much larger than the island of [[Elenna]]. King [[Tar-Meneldur]] of Númenor also used the name Great Lands, and further '''Dark Lands''' in his speech to his son [[Aldarion]].<ref>{{UT|4}}.</ref>\n\nIn verses such as [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s ''[[Eärendillinwë]]'' and [[Galadriel's Song]],<ref>{{FR|Lorien}}</ref><ref>{{FR|Farewell}}</ref> it is referred to as the '''Hither Shores'''. The Hobbits envisioned Middle-earth as the '''Wide World'''.<ref>{{H|8}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', Middle-earth was usually called the '''Great Lands'''. The name \"Middle-earth\" was never used until the writings from the 1930s.<ref name=\"LT1In\">{{LT1|In}}, p. 21.</ref> Originally the name in the Lost Tales was '''Outer Lands''', but Tolkien gave the name a different meaning, \"lands West of the Great Sea\", and amended it to \"Great Lands\".<ref name=\"LT1In\" /><ref>{{LT1|IIIn}}, p. 81.</ref> Once is found the name '''Lands Without''',<ref>{{LT2|IV}}, p. 233.</ref> that is: \"Lands without Valinor\".<ref>{{LT2|Index}}, p. 370.</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] created Arda, especially Middle-earth, for his languages Quenya and Sindarin, especially the latter. To Tolkien, a scholar of the [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] language, Middle-earth was the English translation of the Old English word ''middanġeard''. This word was transformed in the [[Middle English]] ''midden-erd'' or ''middel-erd'', and the [[Old Norse]] ''Midgard''. This is English for what the Greeks called the οικουμένη (''oikoumen&#x113;'') or \"the abiding place of men\", the physical world as opposed to the unseen worlds.<ref>{{L|151}}</ref>\n\nThe ancient peoples called the world \"middle-earth\", since it was imagined to be above the realm of the Giants and below the realm of the gods. However, in Tolkien's cosmology the name Middle-earth refers only to a continent, which (in the First and Second Ages) is set between two seas, Belegaer and the East Sea.\n\n[[Henry Resnick]] quoted Tolkien as saying that, \"Middle-earth is Europe\".<ref>[[Tolkien Journal]] II, 2 p. 1</ref> However, Tolkien designed his maps to accommodate the mythology,  conscious that they did not fit the ancient Earth as understood by contemporary archaeology and historical geology.<ref>{{L|169}}</ref><ref name=\"L211\" />\n\n==Appendix==\n===Terminology===\nThe ''continent'' of Middle-earth is the primary setting of most of the stories in the [[legendarium]]. Although there are several stories that take place in Aman (such as some chapters of ''The Silmarillion'') and Númenor (such as the ''[[Akallabêth]]'' and ''[[Aldarion and Erendis: The Mariner's Wife|Aldarion and Erendis]]'').\n\nIn the [[fandom]], the term \"Middle-earth\" generally refers to Tolkien's [[secondary world]], or [[Wikipedia:fictional universe|fictional universe]], including its pantheon and cosmology. Tolkien himself used the term loosely at times to refer to his creation.<ref name=\"wiki\" />\n[[File:The Atlas of Middle-earth.jpg|thumb|Being actually ''The Atlas of '''Arda''''']]\nAs a result, \"Middle-earth\" is used synonymously with \"Arda\" as a more recognizable term for titles such as ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'' and ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'', while their scope is beyond the strict geographical definition of the continent of Endor. Even [[Christopher Tolkien]], while publishing the early drafts and manuscripts of his father, titled the series ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'',<ref name=\"wiki\">{{webcite|articleurl=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth#Usage_and_misunderstandings|articlename=Middle-earth - Usage and misunderstandings|website=Wikipedia}}</ref> thus equating the term \"Middle-earth\" with the entire legendarium. Wikipedia pages are an example of this usage, with article names such as [[Wikipedia:Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf (Middle-earth)]] and the (somewhat erroneous) Arda (Middle-earth).\n\nThe proper but technical term \"Arda\", first appearing in ''The Silmarillion'',<ref name=\"wiki\" /> refers to the entirety of Tolkien's world, and is seen in the names of ''[[Encyclopedia of Arda]]'' or ''[[Ardalambion]]''.\n\nA frequent misuse of the term is the equation of \"Middle-earth\" with the mapped regions, as seen in the maps with ''Lord of the Rings''. Actually, these regions are just the [[Westlands]] of Middle-earth: the north-western portion of the continent.  How far Middle-earth extends to the East and the South of the map is unknown. Although [[Mordor]] is seen to the south-eastern corner of the map, that does not mean it belongs to the south-eastern Middle-earth, as there are presumably other lands to the east and south.<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry \"Middle-earth\"</ref> [[Karen Fonstad]] has attempted to reconstruct the entirety of the continent, beyond the Westlands, based on an [[:File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Ambarkanta Map V.png|early map by Tolkien]].<ref>{{HM|AME}}</ref>\n\n===Middle-earth and the Old World===\nIn the earliest drafts of the [[legendarium]], ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', the mythology had more direct connections with our history: [[Littleheart]] compares the [[Fall of Gondolin]] with the fall of \"[[Wikipedia:Babylon|Bablon]]\", \"[[Wikipedia:Nineveh|Ninwi]]\" and \"[[Wikipedia:Troy|Trui]]\".<ref>{{LT2|III}}</ref> The [[Mannish]] language of [[Taliska]] was based on [[Gothic]].<ref>{{PE|19}}, \"The Comparative Tales\", p. 22</ref> Britain was supposed to be former [[Tol Eressea]] that was driven towards the [[Great Lands]], with Ireland (the Isle of [[Iverin]]) being a part that broke from it. The main character [[Ottor Wǽfre]] was intended to be the father of legendary figures [[Wikipedia:Hengest|Hengest]] and [[Wikipedia:Horsa|Horsa]], who conquered England from the Guidlin, the [[Wikipedia:Britons (Celtic people)|Brithonin]] and the [[Wikipedia:Ancient Rome|Rumhoth]]. In a later sketch, the Elves were from the region of [[Luthany]] before being pulled out of the mainland and becoming an island.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}</ref>\n\nTolkien envisioned his stories to take place on our world, in an imaginary historical period that contains the essentials of northwestern Europe. He did not see his stories as happening on a \"remote globe in 'space'\", as was the case with other contemporary fiction.<ref>{{L|183}}</ref>\n\nAs for the later legendarium, [[The Shire]] was not only conceptually based on rural England,<ref>{{L|190}}</ref> but was also expressly stated to be \"in this region\",<ref name=\"L211\">{{L|211}}</ref> \"the North-West of the [[Wikipedia:Old World|Old World]], east of the Sea\".<ref>{{FR|Prologue}}</ref> \n\n[[File:Didier Willis - Middle-earth and Europe projection.png|thumb|left|Experimental projection of the Westlands over Europe]]\nConcerning the Shire, Tolkien stated that he intended it to correspond roughly to the latitude of [[Oxford]], which would cause other Middle-earth locations to correspond (but not necessarily equate with) real-life locations. For instance, [[Minas Tirith]] would fall to about the latitude of [[Wikipedia:Florence|Florence]], and [[Pelargir]] and the mouths of Anduin to that of ancient [[Wikipedia:Troy|Troy]].<ref>{{L|294}}</ref> According to the annotations provided by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] to [[Pauline Baynes]], Hobbiton is again approximately at the same latitude as Oxford, and Minas Tirith is about the latitude of [[wikipedia:Ravenna|Ravenna]]. The bottom of the map is about the latitude of [[wikipedia:Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], and [[Umbar]] about that of [[wikipedia:Cyprus|Cyprus]]. Minas Tirith, being approximately 900 miles east of Hobbiton, is located near [[wikipedia:Belgrade|Belgrade]].<ref>''The Guardian'', 23 October 2015, \"[http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/23/jrr-tolkien-middle-earth-annotated-map-blackwells-lord-of-the-rings Tolkien's annotated map of Middle-earth discovered inside copy of Lord of the Rings]\".

Middle-earth has appeared in animation in [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' and [[Rankin/Bass]]' adaptations of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]''. Middle-earth has also appeared and in television series, such us ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power|The Rings of Power]]'' by Amazon. Middle-earth has also appeared in numerous video games such as ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North|War in the North]]'' and tabletop role-playing games like the ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'' system by [[Iron Crown Enterprises]].\n\nEach adaptation has made changes, subtractions, or additions to Tolkien's creation, often adding new locations, creatures, or characters. For the most part, however, the overall geography and style of Tolkien's Middle-earth have been retained.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Arda]]\n*[[History of Arda]]\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Middle-earth| Middle-earth]]\n[[de:Mittelerde]]\n[[fi:Keski-Maa]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/regions/terre du milieu]]"}}}
