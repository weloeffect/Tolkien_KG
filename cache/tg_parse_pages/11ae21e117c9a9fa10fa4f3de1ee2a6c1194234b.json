Related to bats are also [[vampires]], evil bat-like creatures.\n\nIn the late [[First Age]], [[Thuringwethil]] was [[Sauron]]'s messenger and took the form of a giant bat with great fingered wings. [[Lúthien]] would take her form when she and Beren journeyed to [[Thangorodrim]].<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>\n\nBats were apparently quite common in the northern parts of [[Middle-earth]].  When [[Bilbo Baggins]] was walking alone in the tunnels of the [[Misty Mountains]] he heard the whirr of bats by his ears so often that it ceased to startle him.<ref>{{H|Riddles}}</ref>  As Bilbo and the dwarves marched through [[Mirkwood]] they gave up lighting fires at night because they attracted thousands of moths, followed by huge black bats.<ref>{{H|Flies}}</ref>  Bilbo encountered yet another bat in [[Smaug]]'s lair after the dragon had gone away.  This creature, brushing Bilbo's face, caused the hobbit to stumble and his torch to go out (which brought the dwarves to his rescue with more torches).<ref>{{H|Home}}</ref>  Bats were most famous in Middle-earth for taking the part of the [[Orcs|Goblins]] during the [[Battle of Five Armies]], in which they flew together over the battlefield so densely that no light could be seen between their wings.<ref>{{H|Burst}}</ref>\n\n==Other names==\nIn [[Gnomish]], one of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s early conceptions of an [[Elvish|Elven]] language, the word for \"bat (animal)\" is ''cwildred''.<ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 28</ref>\n\n==Other fiction==\nIn the story ''[[Roverandom]]'', the ''shadowbats'' are mentioned among the creatures living on the moon.<ref>{{HM|R}}, \"[Chapter] 2\"</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations== \n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Bats are found in caves throughout [[Middle-earth]], especially in [[Moria]]. They are frequently the pets of the [[Vampires#Portrayal in adaptations|Merrevail]].\n\n'''2014: ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]'':'''\n:Bats can sometimes be seen flying out of caves when [[Talion]] enters or exits them.\n\n[[File:The Hobbit - The Battle of the Five Armies - Bats.jpg|right|thumb|Bats in ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'']]\n[[File:The Hobbit - The Battle of the Five Armies - Gundabad Bat.jpg|right|thumb|Closeup shot of said bats]]\n'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''\n:Thousands of bats, accompanying a second [[Orcs|Orc]] army, are sent from [[Gundabad]] to the [[Lonely Mountain]] for the [[Battle of Five Armies|Battle of the Five Armies]].\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Bats]]\n[[Category:Servants of Melkor]]\n[[Category:Servants of Sauron]]\n[[de:Fledermäuse]]\n[[fi:Lepakot]]"}}}
