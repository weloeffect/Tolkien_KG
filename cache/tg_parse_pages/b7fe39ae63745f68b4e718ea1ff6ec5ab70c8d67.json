As the Valar were sent into Eä.|''[[The Nature of Middle-earth]]'', \"The Primal Impulse\"}}</center>\n\nThe '''Incarnate''' ('''''Mirröanwi''''' in [[Quenya]]<ref>{{MR|Finrod}}, pp. 325, 350</ref>) races were those beings whose natural state is to exist as a union of ''[[fëa]]'' \"soul\" (or \"spirit\") and ''[[hröa]]'' (\"body\"). The [[Children of Ilúvatar]], [[Men]] and [[Elves]] are Incarnates along with [[Dwarves]], [[Ents]] and possibly a few other animals who were later given ''fëar'' by [[Ilúvatar|Eru Ilúvatar]].\n\nIncarnates are described as existing in two parts: they have a \"spirit\" or \"soul\" called a ''fëa'' which comes from the [[Secret Fire]] of Ilúvatar, and a body or ''hröa'' which is made out of the material of [[Arda]]. The Elves compared the relationship of ''hröa'' and ''fëa'' to a House and an Indweller. For this reason, when death (which is the separation of the two) occurred, the ''fëa'' was said to be \"houseless\" or \"in exile\". ''Fëar'' are said to come from beyond the created Universe (that is, [[Eä]]), directly from Ilúvatar, while ''hröar'' are of course begotten by parents. According to the Elves, the ''fëa'' is nearly powerless without the ''hröa'', and likewise the ''hröa'' would die without the ''fëa''. Only when they are together are the incarnates complete beings who can take part in the history of the world, for which reason they are called the Incarnates by the Elves.\n\nThe [[Ainur]], being [[ëalar]] (spirits that are not in need of a ''hröar''), did not inherently have a physical form, but those that wished to could take one.<ref>{{S|Ainu}}</ref> Although their souls were still immortal, their physical bodies were capable of pain, weariness, fear, and could be killed.<ref>{{L|156}}</ref> They had ''[[fana]]r'' rather than hröar; and as their natural state is one without hröar, they are not considered Incarnate.<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 179</ref> \n\n==Children of Ilúvatar==\n===Elves===\n[[File:Elena Kukanova - Celegorm and Beleg at the gates of Mandos.jpg|thumb|''Celegorm and Beleg at the gates of Mandos'' by [[Elena Kukanova]]]]\nThe Elves' fate is to live as long as Arda exists; they are bound to the world and cannot leave it. Unlike Men, Elves do not die of disease or of old age. For this reason, their ''hröar'' are much more well adapted to the presence of their ''fëar'' than Men. Their spirits are in considerably greater control of their bodies. In turn, the Elves' ''hröar'' are much more durable than those of Men, and they can heal from wounds that would be fatal to mortals.\n\nHowever, since ''fëar'' are indestructible within the world, while ''hröar'' can be broken by the disorders of [[Arda Marred]], \"death\", which is their separation, is an ever present risk of existence in [[Middle-earth]], even for the Elves. They may be slain or lose the will to live, for instance because of grief. When an Elf dies, the ''fëa'' leaves the ''hröa'', which then \"dies\" and is reabsorbed into Arda. The ''fëa'' is called to the [[Halls of Mandos]], where it is judged. After a time of Waiting, the ''fëa'' may be reincarnated into a new-born body that is identical to the previous ''hröa'' if allowed by [[Mandos]]. It is only by coming to Mandos that an Elvish ''fëa'' can hope to be reincarnated, as the Elves do not possess this ability in themselves. Alternatively, a ''fëa'' might decide to stay in Mandos until the end of Arda, or it may be denied reincarnation, if it had done much evil in life.\n[[File:Anna Kulisz - The death of Miriel.jpg|thumb|left|''The death of Míriel'' by [[:Category:Images by Anna Kulisz|Anna Kulisz]]]]\nFor slain Elves, going to the Halls of Mandos was an option and not a requirement; their ''fëar'' could refuse the summons of Mandos and remain in Middle-earth, though if they made this choice they could not be reembodied. Refusal of the summons was seen as a sign of taint in the ''fëa'', since Mandos' call is backed by the authority of the [[Valar]], and because the presence of the Dark Lords [[Melkor|Morgoth]] and [[Sauron]] caused most ''fëar'' to flee to Mandos in terror of the power of the Shadow. Many who resisted the summons in those Ages succumbed to the \"counter-summons\" of the Dark Lords, falling under their dominion.<ref name=\"Fourth\">{{MR|P3II3}}, p. 223</ref> It was said that in later Ages, more and more Elvish ''fëar'' chose to ignore the summons and instead haunt places they had frequented in life. Because these ''fëar'' in many cases had unworthy motives (such as the desire to possess the ''hröar'' of others), it was forbidden to the Living to commune with them. Sauron's title \"the [[Necromancer]]\" might have referred to his practice of mastering these Houseless ''fëar'' and using them to do his will.\n\nDue to the Marring of Arda, the Elves living in Middle-earth suffered a weakening of their ''hröar'' over long periods of time. This waning caused their ''fëar'' to consume their bodies, so that in the end they became much like wraiths. It was the weakening of the ''hröar'' of the Elves that brought about the [[Dominion of Men]] and the departure of the [[Eldar]] into [[Aman|the West]]: the Elves in Middle-earth could only avoid this grievous process by leaving the lands they loved and sailing to [[Aman]], for such waning of the body did not exist there. In the West, the Elves could maintain a normal incarnate state.\n\n===Men===\n[[File:Tuuliky - The Death.jpg|thumb|''The Death'' by [[:Category:Images by Tuuliky|Tuuliky]]]]\nThe situation of Men is much different from that of the Elves: a Mannish ''fëa'' is only a visitor to Arda, and when the ''hröa'' (inevitably) dies, the ''fëa'' leaves Arda completely. This severance of ''fëa'' and ''hröa'' happens after a short time, especially as the Elves measure it. For this reason, it is said that Men are not bound to the fate of Arda as the Elves are, and are released from Time itself. This mode of mortality is called the [[Gift of Men]] by the Elves, and is a fate unique to them. It is important to note that Men themselves, however, rarely view death as a Gift, and even have [[Tale of Adanel|traditions]] stating that they also possessed immortality (or at least much longer life) until they were corrupted by [[Morgoth]].\n\nWhat happens to Men after death is unknown to any of the inhabitants of Arda, except perhaps some of the Valar. The Elves said that they went to the Halls of Mandos as well (though without choice in the matter), and were there given up to Ilúvatar, though this is mere speculation. There were some that were cursed to stay in Arda, specifically the ones cursed by [[Isildur]] and became known as the [[oathbreakers]]. However, the Valar proclaimed to the Elves that eventually the race of Men would participate in the [[Second Music of the Ainur]], whereas the ultimate fate of the Elves is unknown.  \n\nBecause the ''fëar'' of Men must leave the world while the Elves must remain in it until its end, it is said the fates of Men and Elves are sundered.\n\n===Half-elves===\nThere were at least four marriages between Elves and Men, which resulted in [[Half-elven]] children. Those who were in contact with the Valar were given the choice to be numbered among Elves or Men. This choice was of course mainly one of the ''fëa'', not the ''hröa''. For example, [[Lúthien|Lúthien Tinúviel]] chose the Fate of Men, and so her ''fëa'' passed out of Arda and was lost to her kin.\n\nAmong those who did not have contact with the Valar, such as (possibly) the [[Lord of Dol Amroth|Lords of Dol Amroth]], Mannish mortality appeared to be the default state.\n\n==Dwarves==\nThe seven [[Fathers of the Dwarves]] were created by [[Aulë]] but he didn't have the power to grant independent life to any creation, and the [[Dwarves]] were bound to his will. As a result the Dwarves had only ''hröar'' and not ''fëar''. When Ilúvatar learned about the Dwarves he intended to destroy them but as he lifted his hammer to destroy them, the Dwarves begged for mercy and Ilúvatar took pity on them and granted them ''fëar'' making the Dwarves incarnate.<ref>{{S|2}}</ref>\n\n==Other ''fëar''==\n''Fëar'' were also granted to the [[Ents]] and some animals, such as [[Huan]] the Hound and the great [[Eagles]] (but see [[Eagles#Origin and nature|this section]] of the article). \n\nBeing Morgoth's corruptions of the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] with their independent wills, the [[Orcs]] certainly had fundamental features of the Incarnates,<ref>{{LE|153}}: \"''Orcs ''[…]'' are fundamentally a race of ‘rational incarnate’ creatures, though horribly corrupted, if no more so than many Men to be met today.''\"</ref><ref>{{WJ|Quendi}}, p. 359</ref><ref name=\"Orcs\">{{MR|P5X}}, pp. 417-8</ref> and thus they most likely indeed possessed ''fëar''. Although the Orcs were mortal, even short-lived in comparison with the [[Edain]],<ref name=\"Orcs\" /> their ultimate fate after death remained a mystery. ''(See also: '''[[Orcs/Origin]]'''.)''\n\n==Etymology==\n''Mirröanwi'', singular ''Mirröanwë'', is a [[Quenya]] word meaning \"Incarnates\". It is used in reference to the [[Children of Ilúvatar]], who were designed to live as embodied souls.\n\n[[Patrick H. Wynne]] has suggested that ''Mirröanwi'' can be analyzed as containing ''[[mi]]'' (\"in\") and ''[[hröa]]'' (\"body\").<ref>{{VT|48a}}, p. 34</ref>\n\n==Other names==\nA previous term for \"Incarnates\" is '''''Fairondi''''', which contains the word ''fairë'' (\"spirit\"), but the meaning of the final element is obscure.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 124</ref> Another one was '''''hröambari''''',<ref>{{NM|P1iii}}, p. 14</ref> clearly a combination of ''hröa'' + ''[[ambar]]'' (\"habitation\").\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Concepts]]\n[[Category:Races]]"}}}
