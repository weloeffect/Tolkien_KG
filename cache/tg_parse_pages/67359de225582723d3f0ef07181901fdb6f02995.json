The music was written by Darryl Grant Potter and Michael Bohl; lyrics were by Darryl Grant Potter.  After two more albums – ''Journey Through Love'' in 2006, and [[All that Glitters]] in 2009, [[Soundestiny]] released the follow-up LOTR-inspired album – [[Winds of Change]] in 2010. The band then returned to the studio to record another folk rock album of music entitled [[Dragon Quest]], inspired by ''[[The Hobbit]]''. The albums ''Shadow Rising'' and [[Winds of Change]] together form a 25 song rock opera or rock musical titled '''RingLord'''. This rock musical was inspired by ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' only. Throughout the song lyrics, there are no mentions of any of the characters from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', such as [[Gandalf]] or [[Aragorn]], nor of [[Middle-earth]] place names like [[Rivendell]] or [[Lothlórien|Lothlorien]]. \n\n== Lineup ==\n*Darryl Grant Potter: vocals, guitar, keyboards, flute\n*Elissa Maclean: vocals\n*Michael Bohl: guitar, bass\n*Julia Lefik: vocals\n\n== Guests ==\n*Greg Tschernez: drums, bass on tracks 1, 3 and 4\n*Paul Lines: vocals\n\n== Production ==\n*Engineer: Greg Tschernez\n*Arrangers: Darryl Grant Potter and Greg Tschernez\n*Artwork: Natalie Camilleri\n\n==Track listing==\n1.
