Brego was invented by [[Warner Bros.]] for [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]], where he was portrayed by a horse named [[Uraeus]]. [[Viggo Mortensen]] purchased the horse after the production of the films. \n\n==History==\nDuring the evacuation of [[Edoras]], it is proposed by the [[Rohirrim]] that they leave Brego behind, due to how skittish and uncontrollable he is. However, when [[Aragorn]] offers his aid to the Rohirrim, he is able to calm the horse through some words in the [[Sindarin]] [[Elvish]] language. While he did so, [[Éowyn]] informs him that Brego belonged to her now-deceased cousin [[Théodred]]. Aragorn advises the grooms to set Brego free, as the horse had \"seen enough of war\".\n\nLater, when [[Aragorn]] was presumed dead and lost, it is Brego who found Aragorn’s unconscious body,<ref>{{TTTEE|Grace}}</ref> taking him to the Hornburg while still somehow finding the time to show him [[Saruman|Saruman's]] fast approaching army of [[Uruk-hai]] from [[Orthanc]].\n\nAfter the [[Battle of the Hornburg]] at Helm's Deep, Brego bore Aragorn once more as a rider on the road to [[Isengard]]. With Aragorn, they returned to [[Edoras]]. \n\nLater, he accompanied Aragorn to [[Dunharrow]], and even up to the [[Dark Door]] itself. However, due to the [[Oathbreakers|darkness]] of that [[Paths of the Dead|path]], Brego choose to flee with the other horses, leaving Aragorn, [[Gimli]], and [[Legolas]] to brave the [[Paths of the Dead]] themselves. Brego later reunited with Aragorn, who rode him to the [[Black Gate]] to face [[Sauron]] and his forces. Brego's later fate is untold.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe horse ''Brego'' was apparently named after the king ''[[Brego]]''.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.brego.net/lord-of-the-rings/horses/brego/ Brego in The Lord of the Rings] at Brego.net\n\n{{References}}\n\n{{title}}\n\n[[Category:Animals from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings (film series) characters]]\n\n[[de:Brego (Pferd)]]\n[[fi:Brego (hevonen)]]"}}}
