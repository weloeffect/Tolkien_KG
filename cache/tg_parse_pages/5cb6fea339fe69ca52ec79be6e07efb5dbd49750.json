It makes a relic appearance in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', in the form of ''[[Gildor|Gildor '''Inglor'''ion]]''.\n\n==Finrod==\nIn earlier versions of the [[legendarium]], until the era of the first edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the name ''Finrod'' was given to the character later known as [[Finarfin]]. [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] was at the time known as Inglor Felagund.<ref>{{SM|QA1}}, p. 213</ref>\n\nThe name however was survived in the patronym ''Inglorion''. The character with the name ''Inglorion'' in ''The Fellowship of the Ring'' [[Gildor|Gildor Inglorion]], although a fellow Noldo, was unrelated to Finrod and certainly not his son. Finrod, as seen in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', was unmarried and childless because his lover, [[Amarië]] of the Vanyar, did not follow him to Middle-earth.<ref>{{S|15}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Inglor'' in the early appearances was interpreted as \"heart-gold\", from the [[Sundocarmë|root]]s [[ID-]] and [[LAW]].<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, pp. 361, 368, entries \"[[ID-]]\", \"[[LAW]]\"</ref>\n\nAt one point, Tolkien interpreted ''Inglor'' as a hypothetical [[Sindarin]] name of Felagund's father [[Finarfin]], a translation of his Quenya [[Amilessë|mother-name]] '''''[[Ingalaurë]]''''' (\"Top Gold\"), but \"this was not actually applied to Finarfin who never came to Beleriand\".<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 118</ref>\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Elves]]"}}}
