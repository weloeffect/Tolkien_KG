[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] taught there between [[1920]] and [[1925]]; first as Reader but later a full Professor. \n\n==Tolkien at Leeds==\nThe University was Tolkien's second post-[[World War I|war]] employer. After the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary|New English Dictionary]]'' and a year of tutoring students in [[Oxford University]], Tolkien decided to apply for a post at the University of Leeds. Tolkien had an interview with [[George S. Gordon]], the University's Professor of English, in June 1920.<ref name=\"Interlude\">{{B|III}}, \"Oxford Interlude\"</ref> It was a fruitful job interview: Tolkien was appointed a Reader in English Language in October of the same year, with a free commission to develop the linguistic side of a large and growing School of English Studies.<ref name=\"L7\">{{L|7}}</ref> \n\nThe start was rough: though Gordon found Tolkien a room in Leeds,<ref name=\"L46\">{{L|46}}</ref> [[Edith Tolkien|Edith]] and young [[John Tolkien|John]] still lived in [[Oxford]]. In weekends, Tolkien would go to his family - now expanded with the birth of [[Michael Tolkien|Michael]]. Not until [[1921]] did Tolkien get full housing for his family, first at [[5 Holly Bank]]<ref name=\"Chronology1921\">{{CG|C}}, \"1921\"</ref> and then at [[11 St. Mark's Terrace]].<ref name=\"Venture\">[[Humphrey Carpenter]], ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]'', \"Northern venture\"</ref> They later moved to [[2 Darnley Road]].<ref>{{HM|LFC}}</ref>\n\nUnder Gordon, Tolkien began focusing on philology, and taught various courses, such as \"[[Old English]] heroic verse, the history of English, various Old English and [[Middle English]] texts, Old and Middle English philology, introductory Germanic philology, [[Gothic]], [[Norse|Old Icelandic]] [...], and Medieval [[Welsh]]\". He boasted that he played a role in developing the linguistic side of the School of English Studies which had previously been entirely devoted to literary studies. The formation of the [[Viking Club]], was a result of his success encouraging the study of philology and especially Old Icelandic amongst his students.<ref name=\"L7\"/> \n\nHis focus on teaching has adversely affected his research output.<ref name=\"L7\"/> He might have continued to fret on some of his hardest assignments of his time at the ''OED''; several notes of his time show his added thoughts on \"''walrus''\" and \"''walnut''\" in Leeds notebooks.<ref>{{HM|RW}}, p. 23</ref>  The post of Reader was changed into a Professorship,<ref name= \"L46\"/> and in [[1922]], Tolkien was joined by [[E.V. Gordon]].<ref name= \"Venture\"/> Together, they started work on ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (edition)|Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'', and Tolkien continued to work on his ''[[A Middle English Vocabulary]]''.<ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond]], [[Douglas A. Anderson]], ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography]]'', \"A: Books by J.R.R. Tolkien\"</ref> A year later, they would be joined by [[Lascelles Abercrombie]]<ref name=\"L46\"/> and [[Wilfred Rowland Childe]].<ref name=\"Chronology1922\">{{CG|C}}, \"1922\"</ref>\n\nW. A. Craigie resigned from the post of [[Rawlinson and Bosworth Professorship of Anglo-Saxon]] at the Oxford English School, and Tolkien wrote a letter expressing his desire to return there.<ref name=\"L7\"/> Tolkien left Leeds [[Letter 8|somewhat abruptly]] in [[1925]] when he was elected to the Professorship, so that he actually occupied both posts simultaneously for the duration of [[1926]].<ref name=\"L46\" /> Reflecting on his time at Leeds in a later letter, Tolkien refuted the idea that he did not enjoy his time there:\n{{blockquote|I was devoted to the University of Leeds, which was very good to me, and to the students, whom I left with regret. The present students are among my most attentive readers...<ref name=\"L229\">{{L|229}}</ref>}}\n\n==Publications==\nTolkien contributed several poems to ''[[The Gryphon]]'', ''[[Yorkshire Poetry]]'', ''[[A Northern Venture]]'' and ''[[Leeds University Verse 1914-24|Leeds University Verse]]''. He also finished stories that would later become ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]'',<ref name=\"Venture\"/> and started five poetic works as part of his mythology, but only the ''[[Lay of Leithian]]'' and the ''[[Lay of the Children of Húrin]]'' were more than just beginnings, the other three were [[Poems Early Abandoned|abandoned]].<ref>{{LB|2}}, p. 131</ref>\n\nBetween [[1922]] and [[1928]] Tolkien tried to work on the \"[[Clarendon Chaucer]]\" project with [[George S. Gordon]], in order to produce a volume of selections from the works of Geoffrey Chaucer for Oxford students. However, due to circumstances the project was left unfinished.<ref>{{CG|RG}}, pp. 153-6</ref>\n==See also==\n\n*[[G.H.
