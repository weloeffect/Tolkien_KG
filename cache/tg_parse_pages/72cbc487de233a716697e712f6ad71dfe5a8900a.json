When Grimbold left with Prince [[Theodred]] for the [[Fords of Isen]], the duties of Grimslade's Thane fell to his wife Hildith. On [[3 March]] of [[Third Age 3019]] Grimslade is attacked by [[Saruman]]'s [[half-orc]]s who intend to burn it, but the attackers are repelled by the forces of [[Elfhelm]] during their march towards [[Edoras]].\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings]]\n[[Category:Rohan]]\n\n[[de:Grimslade]]\n[[fr:encyclo:geographie:villes tours et forteresses:rohan:grimslad]]\n[[fi:Grimslade]]"}}}
