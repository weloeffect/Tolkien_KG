It appears in their third full-length album, [[Third Age of the Sun]].\n==Lyrics==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nFrom I shore I have known for long \nI heard enchanting songs \n\nMeadow was dancing \nBy the flute and the harp \nThe water was silent and so calm \n\nI walked to the path across the sea \nI walked to the place ever unseen \nInto the fields and the streams \nBeyond the land of the dreams \n\nBrif moment it took \nThen faded away \nI followed their song \nFollowed their way \nLast sight of the sun \nUntil eventide \nShowed me the road \nServed me as guide \n\nI walked to the path across the sea \nI walked to the place ever unseen \nPassing the walls, passing the signs \nOpening hidden doors of my mind \n\nOn the shore I have known for long \nI sang enchanting songs\n</poem>\n[[Category:Songs by Battlelore]]"}}}
