Gathering thirty of his kin, and aided by [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]] who wished to join the [[War of the Ring|war]], they rode south to [[Rohan]].

Other than [[Halbarad]] and the Sons of [[Elrond]], sixty-two other Rangers and the player form the Grey Company as they journey south. Their path through [[Dunland]] is beset by many dangers, as many Rangers are killed and some are forced to either turn back or stay behind until only thirty remain by the time they finally meet with [[Aragorn]]. Other than Halbarad, seven other Rangers are killed in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] while the rest join the Host of the West on the march towards the [[Black Gate]]. Only one of the Rangers falls during the battle and all of the survivors attend the wedding of Aragorn and [[Arwen]] after which they finally part ways. Some decide to return north to [[Eriador]] while others choose to remain in [[Gondor]] and serve King Elessar alongside [[Rangers of Ithilien]] against the dangers still remaining in [[Mordor]].\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Dúnedain of the North]]\n[[Category:Organizations]]\n[[de:Graue Schar]]\n[[fi:Harmaa Komppania]]"}}}
