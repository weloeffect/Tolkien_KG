Writer and broadcaster Brian Sibley is a foremost expert on The Lord of the Rings (he adapted the novel for the award-winning BBC radio dramatisation in 1980), and here in this clothbound hardback presents an entertaining and informative overview of the writing of The Lord of the Rings, and the creation of the original maps by Tolkien and his son, Christopher.<br><br>\n\nThe book is accompanied by a full-colour illustrated map, which can be removed for reference or even for framing. The map is a real labour of love, illustrated by world-renowned Tolkien artist John Howe, the conceptual artist employed by Peter Jackson to work on his multi-award winning Lord of The Rings film trilogy, and who is soon to work on Guillermo del Toro's Hobbit film. Each element in this collector's package is special; together they provide an enchanting and desirable artefact that will be a prized possession of Tolkien readers of all ages.}}\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[There and Back Again: The Map of Tolkien's The Hobbit]]''\n* ''[[West of the Mountains, East of the Sea]]''\n\n{{title|italics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Road Goes Ever On and On: The Map of Tolkien's Middle-earth}}\n[[Category:Map books]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
