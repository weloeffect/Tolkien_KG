He dwells in the village of \"Harwick\", the main settlement of [[the Wold]], of which he is also the Reeve. His son \"Léodwig\" along with [[Wídfara]] had disappeared in the remote province of \"Wildermore\" and Harding sends the player and his companions [[Gléowine]] and [[Horn (rider of Rohan)|Horn]] to look for them. The player finds both wounded but alive and they eventually return to Harwick. Harding later dies on the [[Pelennor Fields]] after slaying many foes.\n\n{{references}}\n{{title}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:Rohirrim]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n\n[[de:Harding]]\n[[fi:Harding (Rohanin Ratsastaja)]]"}}}
