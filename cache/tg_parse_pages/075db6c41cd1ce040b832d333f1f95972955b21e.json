He was the eldest son of [[Ilion]], and a descendant of [[Imin]] and [[Iminyë]], from eldest son to eldest son. He was beloved by his people, and at some point before the [[Great Journey]] he wed [[Ilwen]] and had several children at Cuiviénen by the time [[Oromë]] found the [[Quendi]].<ref name=\"Gol\">{{NM|P1xvii}}, pp. 127-128</ref> \n\nWhen Oromë invited them to [[Aman]], Ingwë, along with [[Finwë]] and [[Elwë Singollo|Elwë]], were the most eager to visit, and so followed him as ambassadors and travelled to the Blessed Realm. Once there, Ingwë desired to \"dwell in the presence of Varda\", and was reluctant to return to [[Middle-earth]].<ref name=\"Ard\" />\n\nWhen they returned, they held a [[Debate of the Quendi|great debate]], and told their peoples about its beauty and bliss and became their leaders during the [[Great March]]. Ingwë was the leader of the [[Vanyar]], the foremost of the clans to follow Oromë, who were the most eager to reach the [[West]], which they did quickly.<ref name=\"journey\">{{S|3}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Great Journey]], Ingwë never returned or set eyes upon [[Middle-earth]] again.<ref name=\"journey\">{{S|3}}</ref>\n\nHe lived in [[Tirion]] for a while, where he also built the great, white tower at the topmost part of the city, called [[Mindon Eldaliéva]] or the Tower of Ingwë.

So Inwë and the other ambassadors were sent back to Koivië-néni, and managed to convince most of the Elves to come live with the Valar.<ref>{{LT1|V}}, p. 116-8</ref>\n\nThereafter, Inwë became the leader of the [[Vanyar|Teleri]], the first clan of the Elves, and led them to Valinor. He was also regarded as the eldest<ref name=\"Dea\">{{LT1|V}}, p. 129</ref> and greatest<ref>{{LT1|V}}, p. 116</ref> of all the Elves, and afterwards was considered the King of all the Eldar,<ref name=\"Gil\">{{LT1|I}}, p. 16</ref> and his home was at the highest point in [[Kôr]], a great elven city in Valinor, which had a [[Mindon Eldaliéva#Other versions of the legendarium|silver tower]] \"shooting skyward like a needle\".<ref>{{LT1|V}}, p. 122</ref> The Valar also gave Inwë a seedling of one of the Two Trees, which \"blossomed eternally without abating\" in his court.<ref>{{LT1|V}}, p. 123</ref>\n\nMany years later, after the [[fall of Gondolin]], the Elves of [[Kôr]] heard of the plight of the [[Gnomes]] who were enslaved by [[Melko]], and against the wishes of the Valar, Inwë led them to the [[Great Lands]] to wage war against Melko.\n\nAnd even though the Elves were victorious, and Melko defeated and bound by [[Tulkas]], Inwë was, however, killed during the war.<ref name=\"Dea\" />\n\nAfter the war, with the Elves being forbidden to return to Valinor,<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''3''', p. 280</ref> Ingil his son led them from the Great Lands to [[Tol Eressëa]], the Lonely Isle, where he became their leader.<ref name=\"Gil\" />\n\nHis kin and descendants were called the [[Inwir]], one of whom was [[Meril-i-Turinqi]] his great-granddaughter,<ref name=\"Dea\" /> the Lady of Tol Eressëa at the time of the arrival of [[Eriol]] the Mariner, in c. [[wikipedia:5th century|5th century AD]].<ref name=\"Com\" />\n\nIn one outline, the island of Tol Eressëa was also called ''[[Inwinórë]]'' after Inwë, but that was later changed to ''[[Ingilnórë]]'', in honour of his son Ingil instead.<ref>{{PE|12}}, p. xiii</ref> \n\nInwë might have spoken [[Inwelin]], a dialect of [[Telellin]] spoken by the royal clan of Inwir.<ref>{{PE|12}}, p. 2</ref> \n\n====Ingwë of Luthany====\nIn later outlines of the ''Book of Lost Tales'', in which Tol Eressëa ceased to be identified with England, the island of [[Luthany]] appears as a precursor to England, from which the Elves of the Great Lands sail ''to'' Tol Eressëa, now a separate island.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, pp. 300-1</ref>\n\nIn that conception of the legendarium, there appears a character called Ing or Ingwë, a [[Men|Mannish]] King of Luthany who helps and welcomes the Elves to his land, after their war with Melko and, afterwards, with unfriendly Men in the Great Lands.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''18''', pp. 302-3</ref>\n\nHowever, he is ''not'' to be identified with the character of Inwë, or that of Ingwë in the later legendarium, even though [[Christopher Tolkien]] feels there has to be some connection between the two characters.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''21''', pp. 304-5</ref>\n\n====Early etymology====\nThe name ''Inwë'' is in [[Qenya]]. In the ''[[Qenya Lexicon]]'', it is said to be derived from the root [[INI]] (\"small\"),<ref name=\"Ing\">{{LT1|Appendix}}, p. 256</ref> but the earlier, original gloss of the root was \"[[fairy]]\".<ref>{{PE|12}}, pp. 42-3</ref>\n\n====Other names====\nThe [[Gnomish]] cognate of ''Inwë'' is '''''Inwithiel''''',<ref name=\"Gil\" /> changed from '''''Gim Githil'''''.<ref>{{LT1|I}}, Changes made to names in ''The Cottage of Lost Play'', p. 22</ref>\n\nHis proper (Gnomish) name, according to the ''[[Gnomish Lexicon]]'' was '''''Inweg''''' or '''''Im''''', with '''''Githil''''' being the Gnomish cognate of '''''Isil''''', another one of his names.<ref name=\"Ing\" /> '''''Githiel''''' was the poetic form of ''Githil''.<ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 39</ref>\n\nThe original Gnomish form of his name was '''''Ginweg''''', later changed to '''''Gim''''' or ''Githil''.<ref>{{PE|12}}, p. xx</ref>\n\nHe was also called '''''Tur yan Eldaron''''', meaning \"King of the Elves\" in Qenya, with '''''Tur nan Églathon''''' being its Gnomish equivalent.<ref>{{PE|15}}, \"[[Names and Required Alterations]]\", ''Appendix'', ''Text VIII'', p. 16</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Sketch of the Mythology]]'', from c. [[1926]], the name '''''Ing''''' is described as being the Gnomish form of ''Ingwë'', as opposed to the earlier conception of ''Ing'' being a rejected Qenya form of ''Inwë''.<ref>{{SM|2a}}, p. 44</ref>\n\n====Early genealogy====\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | INW |INW='''INWË'''}}\n{{familytree | |!| |}}\n{{familytree | ING |ING=[[Ingil]]}}\n{{familytree | |!| |}}\n{{familytree | UNK |UNK=''unknown<br />child''}}\n{{familytree | |!| |}}\n{{familytree | MER |MER=[[Meril-i-Turinqi]]}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n===Later legendarium===\n====''Quenta Noldorinwa'' and the ''Lhammas''====\nIn the ''[[Lhammas]]'', a text from the 1930s, Ingwë is mentioned as one of the original, and the eldest, of the Elves to be [[Awakening of the Elves|awakened]] at [[Cuiviénen]], and who led his people, chief of whom were known as the ''Ingwelindar'' or ''Ingwi'', to [[Aman]].<ref>{{LR|Lhammas}}, p. 171</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Quenta Noldorinwa]]'' from c. [[1930]], he was still supposed to be one of the leaders of the Eldar in the [[War of Wrath]] (unlike in the later versions, where it was his son Ingwion who led them), and he was still supposed to die in that war, as in the early legendarium in the ''Book of Lost Tales''.<ref>{{SM|CQ2}}, p. 168</ref>\n\n====The Three Ambassadors====\nIngwe was mentioned in several texts which were eventually published in ''[[The Nature of Middle-earth]]''. As in the published ''Silmarillion'' several of them describe him, as one of the [[Three Ambassadors]], going to Aman and witnessing its splendor.\n\nAccording to one text, the ambassadors, after their return to Middle-earth, spoke to the Elves at Cuiviénen. There, Ingwë spoke with great reverence towards the three [[Elf-fathers]], regretting the fact that they themselves were unwilling to go and visit Aman, but he nonetheless asked Oromë whether or not they might still go there, and judge for themselves whether or not the Elves should embark on the [[Great Journey]] - unfortunately, the three Elf-fathers were unwilling to go.\n\nIn another text, [[Tolkien]] changed his mind about the nature of the three ambassadors, and instead proposed that [[Imin]], [[Tata]] and [[Enel]], the three Elf-fathers, ought to become the three ambassadors to Aman, with Ingwë, Finwë and Elwë accompanying them as the representatives of the younger generations of the Elves.\n\nThere, the three (new) ambassadors were undecided, and therefore, the Elves of Cuiviénen asked their younger associates to speak. Here Ingwë, again, spoke with reverence towards Imin, Tata and Enel, and ultimately agreed with Imin in his desire for the beauty of Valinor.\n\nFinally, Imin agreed to a vote, and about two thirds of the Elves gathered at the time agreed to go to Aman.<ref name=\"Ard\">{{NM|P1xiii}}, pp. 96-98</ref>\n\n=====Ingwë's family=====\n{{expansion}}\n\n{{references|notes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ingwe}}\n\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n| race=vanyar\n| house=[[House of Imin]]/[[House of Ingwë]]\n| born=between {{YT|1050}} and {{YT|1102|n}}\n| died=\n}}\n{{Seq\n| prow=2\n| pvac=None\n| prev=''[[Imin]], as Chieftain of the [[Minyar]]''\n| list=High King of the [[Elves]]\n| dates=from {{YT|1105}}\n| nvac=None\n| next=Incumbent\n| nrow=2\n}}\n{{seq\n| list=King of the [[Vanyar]]\n| dates=from {{YT|1105}}\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n\n[[Category:Calaquendi]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:House of Imin]]\n[[Category:House of Ingwë]]\n[[Category:Minyar]]\n[[Category:Quenya names]]\n[[Category:Rulers in Aman]]\n[[Category:Teleri (early legendarium)]]\n[[Category:Vanyar]]\n[[de:Ingwe]]\n[[fr:/encyclo/personnages/elfes/vanyar/ingwe]]\n[[fi:Ingwë]]"}}}
