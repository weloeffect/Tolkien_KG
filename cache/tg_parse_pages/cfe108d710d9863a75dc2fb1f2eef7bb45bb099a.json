The Watchtower of Ostirith was invented for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'' by [[Amazon Studios]].\n\n==History==\nDuring the [[Elder Days]], the Watchtower of Ostirith was originally built by the [[Easterlings (First Age)|Men]] who followed [[Morgoth]], of which, it is said that the tower still possesses a power fashioned for those tainted by the [[Shadow]]. The watchtower also housed the stone-engraven likeness of [[Sauron]], Morgoth's lieutenant. This sculpture concealed an elaborate device that could unleash the fires of [[Mount Doom|Orodruin]].\n\nSometime after the [[Wars of Beleriand]], a garrison of [[Silvan]] [[Elves]] under the command of the [[Revion|Watchwarden Revion]] used the tower for their seventy nine year vigilance over the many villages of the [[Mordor|Southlands]]. This garrison included [[Elves]] such as [[Arondir]] and [[Médhor]].\n\nLate into the [[Second Age]], the elves stationed at Ostirith were captured by a group of [[Orcs]] operating within the [[Mordor|Southlands]] of [[Middle-earth]]. At the same time, [[Bronwyn]] led the villagers of [[Tirharad]] to seek shelter at the tower. Many other refugees fled there as well, such as the villagers of [[Iorbad]].\n\nEventually, Arondir is let out of the Orc camp by leave of the Orcs' leader, [[Adar]], to tell the [[Men]] at the Watchtower to either swear fealty to him or to leave the Southlands.\n\nWhen Arondir delivered the message, some of the villagers, including [[Rowan (The Rings of Power)|Rowan]] and [[Waldreg]], leave the old Watchtower to bend the knee to Adar. The remaining villagers under Bronwyn make up a battle plan for when the Orcs inevitably come for them.\n\nHours later, Adar led his army directly into a trap in which Arondir caused the collapse of the Watchtower. The collapse annihilated much of the army, including [[Bazur]], but did not succeed in killing Adar. \n\nLater, at the behest of Adar, Waldreg returns to the ruins of the Watchtower of Ostirith and uses the [[Orc Sigil Hilt]] as a key to activate a mechanism which opened the dam holding back lake waters. These waters coursed their way to a cavern within [[Mount Doom|Orodruin]], awakening it from its dormancy. The ensuing eruption left Tirharad and what remained of the Watchtower of Ostirith in ruin.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Ostirith'' is a combination of the [[Sindarin]] words ''[[ost]]'' (\"enclosure; fort, citadel; fortified town; fortress or stronghold\")<ref>\"[https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1539713025.html Ost]\" on eldamo.org</ref> and ''[[tirith]]'' (\"watch, ward, guard; watching, guarding\")<ref>”[https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-4116257429.html Tirith]\" on eldamo.org</ref>.\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) locations]]\n[[fi:Ostirith (televisiosarjan paikka)]]"}}}
