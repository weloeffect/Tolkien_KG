The guests of the Cottage would gather around it in the evenings to hear stories told, as was the custom. It was beside this fire that [[Eriol]] learned many tales of the [[Elder Days]].<ref>{{LT1|I}}, p. 17</ref>   After Eriol heared the [[Turambar and the Foalókë|Tale of Turambar]], it was asked that [[Littleheart]] tell the tales of [[Tuor]] and [[Eärendel]], but he answered that in order to tell those stories, the folk had to be reunited seven times around the Tale-fire, for it was a long and twined tale. Therefore, [[Meril-i-Turinqi]] was summoned and three days later a festival was held in the Cottage, with a great host around the fire.<ref>{{LT2|III}}, pp. 144-145</ref>\n\n==Other names==\n\"Tale-fire\" was '''''Tȏn a Gwedrin''''' in [[Gnomish]],<ref>{{LT2|Appendix}}, entry \"Tôn a Gwedrin\"</ref> and '''''Tana Qentima''''' in [[Qenya]].<ref>{{PE|15}}, p. 7</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Hall of Fire]]\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Tol Eressëa]]"}}}
