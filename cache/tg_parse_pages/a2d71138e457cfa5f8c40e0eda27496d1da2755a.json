While Hazad's eyes were dim with age, Tal-Elmar was able to see looked to him like three strange birds sitting ontop of the sea, made white beneath the [[Sun]]. To this, Hazad claimed that the sun must be in his eye. While Tal-Elmar pointed out that the sun was behind them rather than in front of them, he speculates that, whether or not they were birds or something entirely different, they must be of a greater size than the legendary Swans of Gorbelgod. Hazad was proven right immediately afterwards when the fourth bird that follows the three in sight ends up having black wings. Yet, Hazad became troubled by this, believing that it was an ill-omen which he interpreted as a warning that the dangerous [[Go-hilleg]] were coming to Middle-earth with their dreaded black sailed [[Ship of the Dark]].<ref name=Swans/>{{rp|426–7}}\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\n[[Christopher Tolkien]] mentioned in his sixth note that [[J.R.R.
