But his talent was matched by his shyness, and always evaded those who wanted to approach, as he was playing only for himself.<ref name=guild>{{webcite|articleurl=https://www.silmarillionwritersguild.org/node/5977|author=Dawn Walls-Thumma|articlename=Tinfang Warble|dated=1 October 2022|website=Silmarillion Writers' Guild|accessed=23 February 2023}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Eva Zahradníková - Tinfang Warble in autumn.jpg|thumb|left|120px|''Tinfang Warble in autumn'' by Eva Zahradníková]]\n\nTinfang was a half-fay whose origins and nature was shrouded in mystery, yet it was believed everywhere that he was not completely of the [[Valar]] nor fully of the [[Eldar]]. Rather, he was \"half a fay of the woods and dells, one of the great companies of the children of [[Yavanna|Palúrien]] and half a [[Gnomes|Gnome]] or a [[Solosimpi|Shoreland Piper]]\".<ref name=\"dreammusics\"/>\n\nHe was said to be a strange, but a wondrously wise flautist who \"played and danced in summer dusks for joy of the first stars\". He was more shy than a fawn, tending to hide as swiftly as a vole, even at a sound as subtle as a footstep snapping a twig. Yet, he had some prideful nature, going as far as using his flute to mock from afar all those who try to see him. Despite his pride, he led the [[Eldar]] forth while \"piping strangely\" or aloof, but never marched or rested among them.<ref name=\"dreammusics\"/>\n\nTinfang's fluting had an enchantment, and the stars twinkled according to his notes. The [[Gnomes|Noldoli]] claimed that the stars appeared in the sky too soon when he played. Not even the [[Solosimpi]] could rival his fluting, despite their claim of shared kinship.<ref name=\"dreammusics\"/>\n\nTinfang was named by the [[Elves]] alongside [[Daeron|Dairon]] and [[Ivárë]] as being \"the three most magic players\",<ref name=lt2p10>{{LT2|I}}, p. 10</ref> and the [[Moon]] was said to be able to enchant him during summer nights in [[June]], kindling \"the pale firstling star\".<ref>{{LB|C3}}, p. 174, line 503</ref>\n\nHe usually played his flute in the gardens of [[Tol Eressëa]], where he trod upon \"the shadowy lawns unseen\", loving [[Alalminórë]] the best. Whenever his piping is absent for long months, the Gnomes believed that he had \"gone heart-breaking in the [[Great Lands]]\", where many people in far regions would hear his piping during the dusk that night when Tinfang would \"play beneath a goodly moon and the stars go bright and blue\".<ref name=\"dreammusics\"/>\n\nWhen [[Eriol]] spoke to [[Vairë (wife of Lindo)|Vairë]] about hearing \"dream-musics\", and she replied that it was Tinfang, who had not been heard for many nights. In many days afterwards, Eriol heard Tinfang many dusks in starlight and the gleam of the moon.<ref name=\"dreammusics\"/>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''Tinfang'' is probably [[Gnomish]], and [[Christopher Tolkien]] gives the meaning of \"fluter\", a cognate of [[Qenya]] ''timpinen''.<ref>{{BL|Names}}</ref>\n\nLater the meaning is given as \"star-beard\", from ''[[tinu]]'' (\"spark, little star\") + ''[[fang]]'' (\"beard\").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry SPÁNAG</ref>\n\nIn [[Noldorin]], ''[[Gelion]]'' is related to the [[Ilkorin]] word ''gelion'' (\"bright\"), however it is glossed as \"''merry singer, surname of Tinfang''\".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry \"GYEL\"</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nTinfang predates the earliest [[Legendarium]], first appearing as a \"[[leprawns|leprawn]]\" in the [[1914]] poem ''[[Tinfang Warble (poem)|Tinfang Warble]]'' and then in the [[1915]]/[[1916]] poem ''[[Over Old Hills and Far Away]]''. His fluting is associated with stars, either kindling the first one, or making them shimmer.<ref name=guild/>\n\nHe appears as an obscure figure in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', with Eriol listening to his music. Vaire suggests that he lingers mostly in the [[Great Lands]], suggesting that he can easily traverse between Tol Eressea and the mortal lands.<ref name=guild/>\n\nIn a crossed out note, '''Timpinen''' was the son of King [[Thingol|Tinwelint]] and Queen [[Melian|Gwendeling]], and brother of [[Lúthien|Tinúviel]]; after Tinwelint was enchanted, Timpinen and Tinúviel \"long after joined the Eldar again, and tales there are concerning them both, though they are seldom told\".<ref>{{LT1|IVn}}, p. 107-10, Note 1</ref> Even after this rejected notion, Tinúviel's brother becomes ''Tifanto'',<ref>{{LT2|In}}, p. 50</ref><ref group=note>The names are probably cognates of the same elements; cf. {{LT1|Appendix}}, ''Tinfang'' and {{LT2|Appendix}}, ''Tifanto''</ref> before becoming Dairon, whose musical talent is compared to Tinfang's;<ref name=lt2p10/> Tinfang's remaining mentions are associated with Daeron.<ref name=guild/>\n\nIn the second typed draft of ''[[The Lay of Leithian]]'', Warble was quickly amended to '''Gelion''', becoming a surname rather than an epithet; while nothing else of his appearance here changed, the names of Dairon and Ivárë were changed to Daeron and [[Maglor]]. In the ''[[Lay of Leithian]]'', there is no mention of his fay nature, but his fluting still \"kindles the pale firstling star\", reflecting the first poem.<ref>{{LB|C3}}, p. 181-2</ref>\n\nThe last narrative reference to Tinfang was only by name in ''[[The Quenta]]'', where Gelion was reverted back to Warble.<ref>{{SM|Q10}}, p. 113</ref> Subsequently, Tolkien revised the epithet yet again to the surname.<ref>{{SM|Q10}}, pp. 115 (note 12), 179</ref>\n\n== Inspiration ==\nTinfang represents typical fairy-like elements, such as moving from faery to the mortal world, and enchanting the mortals, sometimes to the point of madness.<ref name=guild/>\n\n[[File:Estella Canziani - Piper of Dreams.jpg|thumb|''Piper of Dreams'' by Estella Canziani]]\nTolkien first coined the name for the poem ''[[Tinfang Warble (poem)|Tinfang Warble]]'' , but the character is barely defined here. Its visual equivalence would be soon taken from [[Wikipedia:Estella Canziani|Estella Louisa Michaela Canziani's]] picture ''Piper of Dreams'', in which a child plays the pipe for some [[fairies]]. The image was widely reproduced by the Medici Society in the same year, and was quite prevalent among the English troops during the [[Great War]].<ref>[[John Garth]], ''[[Tolkien and the Great War]]'' ([[2003]]), \"4.
