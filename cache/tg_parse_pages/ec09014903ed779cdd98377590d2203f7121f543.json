Nazgûl (5th). May be played as a hazard creature (with one strike) or as a permanent event. As a creature, may also be played keyed to [[METW: Harondor|Harondor]], [[METW: Horse Plains|Horse Plains]], [[METW: Gorgoroth|Gorgoroth]], and [[METW: Khand|Khand]]; and may also be played at sites in these regions. If played as a permanent-event, it will remain in play until tapped during the opponent's movement/hazard phase (tapping counts against the hazard limit). When tapped, Akhôrahil becomes a short-event and modifies any one character's body by -1 for the rest of this turn. \n\n==Errata==\n\"...modifies any one character's body by -1 for the rest of the turn.\"<ref>''Council of the Isles of the Dead that Live'' (Dutch MECCG Council) web page, as of July 28, 2000.</ref>\n\n==Related cards==\n*MELE: Akhôrahil the Ringwraith\n*MELE: Akhôrahil Unleashed\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:MECCG character cards]]"}}}
