More recently ''The Battles of Tolkien'' has been described saying:\n\n{{blockquote|One of the surprises to me is that this book contains genuinely new content; this isn’t just a rehashing of previous books. And the factual pieces of information on the battles and the characters are accurate: it was a pleasant surprise to me to find none of the painfully obvious errors that were common throughout the previous two books. Similarly, the chronologies – save for one inconsistency on the War of Wrath – were also accurate.|[[Shaun Gunner|Gunner, Shaun]]. \"Review: ''The Battles of Tolkien''\" in ''[[Amon Hen]]'' [[Amon Hen 267|267]]}}  \nHaving acknowledged that the book contains fewer factual errors than earlier books by Day, the reviewer describes it as \"not a work of reference, but an attempt at analysis\" and describing the analysis as \"a bunch of clichéd theories that failed to stretch beyond a child pointing at things and exclaiming 'This is like that!'.\"\n\n==A problematic map of Arda==\n''[[A Tolkien Bestiary]]'' (1979) and later works includes a (unfortunately widespread) map that intentionally gives an overall view of all the lands over all the ages in a composite image. It include the Lamps, the Trees Of The Valar, Númenor, Beleriand, and the Undying Lands which never existed all at the same time. The map is criticized for differences from Tolkien's own maps such as \"Map V\" from the [[Ambarkanta maps|''Ambarkanta'' maps]].<ref>{{webcite|author=Stentor Danielson|website=[http://scholar.valpo.edu/journaloftolkienresearch/ Journal of Tolkien Research]|articleurl=http://scholar.valpo.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&context=journaloftolkienresearch|articlename=Extending Arda: Mapping beyond the Lord of the Rings and Silmarillion|accessed=21 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n''[[Tolkien: The Illustrated Encyclopedia]]'' has Geography section called \"The Evolution of Arda\" that has 8 maps that does show the evolution of the world map throughout the ages.\n\nThe Tolkien community generally steers readers away from the Composite map and instead towards ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'' by [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] (1981, revised 1991).\n\n==Oxonmoot controversy==\nDavid Day attended [[Oxonmoot 2004]] yet failed to pay for his attendance. In the minutes of [[The Tolkien Society]] committee meeting held on 30 October 2004 it states that:\n\n{{blockquote|Chris ''<nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Chris Crawshaw]], Chairman]'' has also written to David Day to ask him to pay his registration for Oxonmoot.
