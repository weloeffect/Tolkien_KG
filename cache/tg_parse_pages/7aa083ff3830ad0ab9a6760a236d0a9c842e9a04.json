Young Eorl swore to avenge his father and managed to tame the horse. He \"doomed\" the horse to carry him for the rest of their lives, and the horse seemingly accepted this burden.<ref name=\"Eorl\"/>\n\nIn {{TA|2510}}, [[Borondir|Borondir Udalraph]] came to the north seeking aid, as the [[South-kingdom]] was attacked by the [[Orcs]] and the [[Balchoth]]. On April 15, Eorl came to the [[Field of Celebrant]], and joined the [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant|battle]]. For his service to [[Gondor]], he was granted [[Calenardhon]] to dwell in. As a return, Eorl and his descendants would have to come to the aid of Gondor when they requested; this was known as the [[Oath of Eorl]].<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref> \n\nEorl ruled from a green hill under the [[White Mountains]].<ref name=\"Eorl\"/>\n\nEven in his older years Eorl never lost his yellow hair. He died in battle against the [[Easterlings]] in {{TA|2545}}.

His horse Felaróf was the first of the [[Mearas]].\n\nEorl was known as \"the Young\" because he became [[Lord of the Éothéod]] at the age of 16 and because he never lost his yellow hair.\n\nHis Oath would be answered at least thrice: once by [[Folcred]] and [[Fastred (son of Folcwine)|Fastred]], once by [[Théoden|Théoden Ednew]] and by [[Éomer]].<ref name=\"Mark\">{{App|Mark}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''Eorl'' is an [[Old English]] translation of genuine [[Rohanese]] '''''þuron''''', which has perhaps influence from [[Elvish]] [[sundocarme|root]] [[TUR]].<ref>{{PE|22}}, p. 159, where Tolkien gives ''þorunahim'' as the genuine form of [[Eorlingas]]</ref>\n\n'''Eorl''' is an Old English word referring to a person of noble rank. It is the ancestor of modern \"earl\". It was the highest rank of nobility in North Germanic culture, not introduced to Britain until the late 9th century, when it replaced the equivalent Old English title ''ealdorman''. The Old Norse equivalent is ''jarl.''<ref>[[Wikipedia:Jarl in Sweden|Jarl in Sweden]] at [[wikipedia:Main Page|Wikipedia]]</ref> [[Þórsteinn Thorarensen]] used ''Jarl'' as the name for the character throughout his Icelandic translation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', along with [[Helm|Hjálmur]], for Helm, [[Thengel|Þengill]] for Thengel, [[Théoden|Þjódan]] for Théoden, and [[Éomer|Jómar]] for Éomer.<ref>{{VT|42}}, [[Arden R.
