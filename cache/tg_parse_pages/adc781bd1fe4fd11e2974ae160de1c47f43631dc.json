She belonged to the [[Fell Folk of the East]]. After a battle in the valley of [[Ishmalog]], Elmar had been taken prisoner by [[Buldar]]. He brought her to his town, called [[Agar]], and wedded her mostly against her wish. Because of this, she placed a curse on the people of Agar, that they should weaken and fade with time, which eventually happened. She had many sons, of which the youngest and closest to her heart was Hazad. She died during Hazad's boyhood, but Hazad named his youngest son Tal-Elmar in her memory and due to the fact that the child resembled her.<ref name=Elmar>{{PM|Elmar}}, pp. 424-426</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| BUL |y| ELM |~|~|y|~|~| HUS |BUL=[[Buldar]]<br /><small>''fl. {{SA}}''</small>|ELM='''ELMAR'''<br /><small>''fl. {{SA}}''</small>|HUS=''unknown<br />husband''}}\n{{familytree| |,|-|^|-|.| | | |!| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| CHI | | HAZ | | UNK | | | | |CHI=''unknown<br />children''|HAZ=[[Hazad Longbeard]]<br /><small>''fl. {{SA}}''</small>|UNK=''unknown<br />child''}}\n{{familytree| | | |,|-|^|-|.| | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | SON | | TAL | | | | | | |SON=''unknown<br />sons''|TAL=[[Tal-Elmar (character)|Tal-Elmar]]<br /><small>''fl. {{SA}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn a penciled note Tolkien considered removing Buldar and having Elmar be wed to Hazad instead.<ref>{{PM|Elmar}}, p. 437, note 5</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Pre-Númenóreans]]\n[[Category:Second Age characters]]\n[[Category:People of Agar]]\n[[Category:Mannish names]]"}}}
