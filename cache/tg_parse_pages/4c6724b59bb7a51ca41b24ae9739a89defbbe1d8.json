Born in Salisbury, he attended drama and mime school, and received the prestigious Carlton Hobbs BBC Radio Award in 1974. This granted him a place among the core cast of the [[BBC|BBC Drama Repertory Company]]. In [[1977]], Daniels got the role of [http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/C-3PO the protocol droid C-3PO] in the space opera ''Star Wars''. Because it was a minor role, and his voice was originally planned to be edited out and dubbed by another actor, he continued to work for the Drama Repertory Company. \n\nWhen [[Ralph Bakshi]] came to record voices for his new adaptation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', he casted several of the BBC's voice actors - [[Michael Graham Cox]], [[Peter Woodthorpe]] - and Daniels landed the role of [[Legolas]]. After the success of the second ''Star Wars'' movie, ''The Empire Strikes Back'', Daniels left the Drama Repertory Company. He did therefore not reprise his role in the [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|radio series]] of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. \n\n==Quotes==\n{{quote|I played Legolas - Prince of the Elves and if I am honest it was a rather odd experience in several ways. The whole cast were in the same studio but we all had to leave a two second gap between the lines which made for rather stilted dialogue and sadly, a rather stilted movie.|Anthony Daniels, Official website}} \n{{quote|I was delighted that his performance clearly echoed many of the artistic nuances that so inflected my own. Orlando has clearly learned most of his craft from following my work and I think he may have a career as an actor of some kind. His interesting decision, in the role of Legolas, was not to play it as a brunette, as did I, but as a blond. I have never played a blond, even in a cartoon. Now, of course, I play a grey.|Anthony Daniels on [[Orlando Bloom]]'s version of [[Legolas]], Official website}}\n\n==External links==\n* '''[http://www.anthonydaniels.com/ Official website]'''\n* {{WP|Anthony Daniels}}\n* [http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Anthony_Daniels Anthony Daniels] at Wookieepedia\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Daniels, Anthony}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings (1978 film) cast]]\n[[Category:Actors and actresses]]\n[[Category:British people]]\n[[Category:People by name]]"}}}
