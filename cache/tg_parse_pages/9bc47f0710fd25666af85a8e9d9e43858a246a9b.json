As with all of the series it consisted of six characters in each of six ''[[Tyellë|tyeller]]'' or 'grades'.  This particular series took its name from the first of its signs, ''[[parma]]'' (literally meaning 'book', but here simply representing the character 'p').  Half of the symbols in this series had one bow or ''[[lúva]]'' while the other half had two bows.  All bows in this series were closed (having a bar across the 'opening' of the bow), curving downwards and to the right from a stem, or ''[[telco]]'', which was either lowered, raised, or shortened. \n\nIn principle, the characters in this series could represent a variety of different sounds, though in practice their use had become essentially standardised by the [[Third Age]]. The first four signs in the series, ''[[parma]]'', ''[[Umbar (word)|umbar]]'', ''[[formen]]'' and ''[[ampa]]'', each represented a variant of the basic 'p' sound: 'p', 'b', 'f' and 'v', respectively.  The fifth sign, ''[[malta]]'', represented 'm', and finally ''[[vala]]'' indicated  'w'.  The names of the characters had been assigned in [[Quenya]] and had also become standardised, which is why the names ''ampa'' and ''vala'' did not match the sound of the consonants that they represented.<ref>{{App|Letters}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parmatema}}\n[[Category:Lettering]]\n[[Category:Quenya nouns]]"}}}
