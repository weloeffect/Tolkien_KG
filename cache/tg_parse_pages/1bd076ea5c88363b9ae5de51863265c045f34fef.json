It was released in the original Portuguese by Martin Claret in [[2019]], and in English by [[Luna Press Publishing]] in [[2022]].\n==From the publisher==\n{{blockquote|\nThe Lord of The Rings, by J. R. R. Tolkien, involves many characters with a common goal: the destruction of the Ring of Power. They connect with each other through their individual journeys and become friends.\n\nThis book analyses how friendship in Tolkien's seminal work collaborates in the development of the characters, as well as contributing to the success of their final goal.\n\nUsing Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics and Thomas Aquinas' Summa Theologica as a reading lens for Tolkien's book, the work also considers Peter Jackson's movie adaptations and their reading of the connection between the characters. Cristina Casagrande's comparative analysis brings together different elements to the study of friendship in Tolkien's narrative, contributing to the development of the reader's and viewer's own ethical thinking and character.}}\n\n==Contents==\n* Seed-gift by Cesar Machado\n* Foreword - Fantasy Friend by [[Ronald Kyrmse]]\n* Preface\n* Chapter 1: Nice to meet you.
