It gives name to the \"Limlight Gorge\" on the northern bank, \"Limlight Glade\" on the [[Fangorn]] side, and the \"Limlight Falls\" through which is plummets below. The river then flows past \"Stangard\", a Rohirrim military town outside the borders of [[Rohan]] proper. It eventually joins the [[Anduin]] at the \"Rushgore\" marsh.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.elvish.org/Tengwestie/articles/DeRosarioMartinez/limlight.phtml ''Musings on '''Limlight''''', a linguistic analysis of the river-name] by Helios De Rosario Martínez and Javier Lorenzo Merino.\n\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Rhovanion]]\n[[Category:Rivers]]\n[[de:Limklar]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/eaux/rhovanion/limeclaire]]\n[[fi:Liituvirta]]"}}}
