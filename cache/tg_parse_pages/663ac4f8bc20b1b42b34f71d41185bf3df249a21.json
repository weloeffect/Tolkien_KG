Originally, the name belonged only to the area around the [[Bay of Balar]], but in time the name was applied to the entire land. \n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Hope Maps - Beleriand Map.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Beleriand Map'' by [[:Category:Images by Hope Maps|Hope Maps]]]]\nIn the First Age, Beleriand was among the westernmost lands of Middle-earth.<ref name=\"western\">{{S|3}}, p. 44</ref> Beleriand had a long western shoreline with the Great Sea [[Belegaer]], including the [[Bay of Balar]] in its south-west. The Ered Luin ([[Blue Mountains]]) formed the eastern border of Beleriand, separating it from [[Eriador]].<ref name=\"western\" /> To the south, Beleriand \"had no sure boundaries; for there were pathless forests in those days between the unpeopled shores and the lower waters of [the river] [[Gelion]].\"<ref>{{HM|WR}}, p. 5</ref><ref>In the earliest conceptions of Beleriand, Tolkien shown it was bound to the south by a [[Great Gulf]] of Belegaer.{{SM|5}}, p. 306</ref> North of Beleriand were the highland regions of [[Hithlum]],<ref name=\"hithlum\">{{S|14}}, p. 112</ref> [[Dorthonion]], and [[Lothlann]].<ref>{{S|18}}, p. 147</ref> Some people considered the land of [[Nevrast]] to be part of Beleriand, while others considered it part of Hithlum.<ref name=\"hithlum\" /> Beleriand stretched about 550 miles broad from [[Eglarest]] on its western shore to the Blue Mountains in the east.<ref name=\":0\">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Carl F. Hostetter]] (ed.). ''[[The Nature of Middle-earth]]'' (Parte One: Time and Ageing; VII. The March of the Quendi).</ref>\n\nThe River [[Sirion]], the chief river of Beleriand, running north to south, divided it into [[West Beleriand]] and [[East Beleriand]]. Crossing it east to west was a series of hills and a sudden drop in elevation known as [[Andram]], the Long Wall. (The river sank into the ground at the ''Fens of Sirion'', and re-emerged below the Andram at the ''Gates of Sirion''.) To the east of the Long Wall, was the River [[Gelion]] and its six tributaries draining the Ered Luin, in [[Ossiriand]] or the Land of Seven Rivers. The River [[Brithon]] and the River [[Nenning]] were the two lesser rivers of the western land of [[Falas]].\n\nBy {{FA|587}}, Beleriand was mostly destroyed and submerged under the sea from the [[War of Wrath]] of the [[Valar]] against [[Morgoth]]. Only a small section of East Beleriand remained, and was known as [[Lindon]].\n\nIn addition, fulfilling a prophecy, the graves of [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]] and [[Morwen]] survived as the island [[Tol Morwen]]. Likewise part of [[Dorthonion]] became [[Tol Fuin]], and the [[Hill of Himring]] became the island of Himling.

The [[OS]] form could have been *''Balariandë'' (''a'' [[i-affection|slid]] to ''e'' because of the following ''i''). \n\nThe element ''Balar'' refers to [[Ossë]], who often dwelt at the shores (although this refers to the earlier [[legendarium]] when Ossë and [[Uinen]] were [[Valar]] of the sea, not [[Maiar]] of Ulmo).<ref name=\"ety\">{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry BAL</ref><ref>{{GA|2}}</ref> It was from Balar that the Teleri expanded and \"colonised\" the region of Beleriand, hence the name.<ref name=\"ety\" />\n\n===Nomenclature===\nThe name ''Beleriand'' originally applied only to the region around the [[Bay of Balar]] whence the name, before expanded to refer to the wider region. Properly ''Beleriand'' does not refer to the [[Northlands]] such as [[Anfauglith]], or the eastern lands of [[Thargelion]]; [[Nevrast]] and [[Dorthonion]] are \"grey areas\".<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 41</ref> However the term ''Beleriand'' is sometimes used collectivelly in [[fandom]] to include all those submerged lands.\n\n==Other names==\n*Middle [[Quenya]] name '''''Valariandë'''''.<ref name=\"Quenta\" />{{rp|202}}\n*Archaic Quenya names '''''Hekelmar''''' and '''''Hekeldamar''''' or, in the [[Telerin|speech of the Teleri]], '''''Heculbar''''' and '''''Hecellubar''''',<ref name=\"WJ\">{{WJ|B}}</ref>{{rp|365}} which meant the 'Land of the Hekeldi', deriving from the name ''[[Sindar|Hekeldi]]'' ('forsaken ones') for [[Úmanyar|those Elves who remained behind]] during the Great Journey<ref name=\"WJ\" />{{rp|374}}.\n*'''''Ingolondë''''' ([[Quenya|Q.]]), meaning \"''Country of the Noldor''\", was an ancient name for the kingdoms of the Noldor in Beleriand.<ref>{{PE|19}}, p. 77</ref>\n*'''''Eldavehtë''''' ([[Quenya|Q.]]), understood and defined as \"a habitation, haunt or place occupied by Eldar\".<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 189</ref>\n\n==Relative location to Eriador and within Middle-earth==\n[[File:Map of Beleriand and Eriador.png|thumb|Map of Beleriand and Eriador by [[Christopher Gilson]], published in {{PE|6}} ([[1983]]).]]\n\nThe [[Map of Beleriand and the Lands to the North|map of Beleriand as published in ''The Silmarillion'']] (1977) shows only a portion of the region, with few common points to the better-known [[Third Age]] [[Westlands]] maps of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''; the only explicit common references are the [[Blue Mountains]], which formed the boundary between Beleriand and [[Eriador]], and the information that in the Third Age, [[Lindon]] was part of Ossiriand that survived Beleriand's destruction at the end of the First Age.\n\nIn [[1979]], [[Charles Noad]]<ref>[[Charles Noad]], \"A Note on the Geography of the First Age\" in ''[[Amon Hen (journal)|Amon Hen]]'' no. [[Amon Hen 38|38]], April 1979, reprinted in ''[[Mallorn (journal)|Mallorn]]'' no. [[Mallorn 27|27]], September 1990, p. 40.</ref> made an attempt to reconstruct a general map of Beleriand and Eriador. Using only the few distance indications from the text of ''The Silmarillion'', Noad's very early attempt is remarkable as it proves very accurate despite being published before ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' (where the island of Himling was first depicted, with Tol Fuin mentioned westwards) and ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''.\n\nIn [[1989]], [[Ronald Kyrmse|Ronald E. Kyrmse]]<ref>[[Ronald Kyrmse]], \"The Geographical Relation between Beleriand and Eriador\" in ''[[Mallorn (journal)|Mallorn]]'' no. [[Mallorn 26|26]], September 1989, pp. 25–27.</ref> independently proposed his own map reconstruction, aligning the isle of [[Himling]] with the hill of [[Himring]]. Kyrmse also identified [[Dolmed]] on the early map of Beleriand as being the same as a mountain on the ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' map (depicted slightly apart of the mountain range and north of the wooden area in [[Forlindon]]), proving that Dolmed still existed in the Third Age (being too far north from the Gulf of Lune to have been destroyed). He might therefore have been the first to discover that Dolmed survived the destruction of Beleriand at the end of the First Age.\n\n[[File:Sage - Beleriand and Eriador collage.png|thumb|How [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] envisioned Beleriand relative to Eriador. The rectangle marks the region shown in the ''The Silmarillion'' map (canon); the rest, including the [[Thangorodrim]], are Fonstad's extrapolations.]]\nIn [[1991]], [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] faced the same problems when she attempted to make a world-map of [[Arda]]. She found a solution by combining an early map for ''The Lord of the Rings'' (published in ''[[The Treason of Isengard]]'')<ref>{{TI|MI}}, p. 302</ref> and an early map for the Silmarillion (published in ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]''),<ref>{{LR|A3}}, pp. 408-411</ref> both being prototypes for the published maps by [[Christopher Tolkien]]. She aligned [[Tol Fuin]] with [[Taur-nu-Fuin]] and [[Himling]] with [[Himring]] and filled the rest of the outline with some inspiration from the [[:File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Ambarkanta Map V.png|only world-map]] by Tolkien.<ref>{{SM|Ambar}}</ref> She brought the coast near that of [[Belfalas]], continued the course of [[Gelion]] to the south-west, extended the south-western tip to emphasize the Bay of Balar, and assumed that area as forested, a continuation of [[Taur-im-Duinath]].<ref name=\"Atlas\">[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]], ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]''</ref>{{rp|3}} While the [[Iron Mountains]] do not appear in the canonical map, Fonstad drew them as a continuation to her imagined range of [[Iron Hills]]—[[Grey Mountains]]—[[Mountains of Angmar]].\n[[File:Didier Willis - Beleriand and Eriador.png|thumb|left|Reconstructed location of Beleriand at the appropriate scale and position relative to [[Eriador]], as drawn by [[Didier Willis]]]]\nIn the early 1990s, [[Didier Willis]] independently made the same attempt using the map from ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' that shows Himling; the second map of Beleriand, which was published in ''[[The War of the Jewels]]'' and indicates distances;<ref>{{HM|WJ}}, pp. 182-185</ref> and the draft map of the lands east of the Blue Mountains published in ''The Treason of Isengard'', which also indicates distances.
