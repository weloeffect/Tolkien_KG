A little to the north of the Settlement Vanderdecken and his crew are in shore quarters; the ''Flying Dutchman'' anchored close by. To the south are the amicable if unintelligent Snergs, some off-shoot of the pixies. Rather naughtily Joe and Sylvia run away, and in the company of Gorbo - of all Snergs least intelligent - get mixed up with magic and find themselves ''the wrong side of the river''. Escapes from Golithos, an ogre imperfectly reformed; from Mother Meldrum, that sinister witch; from the wicked King Kul; and the rescue by Vanderdecken and the Snergs, fill a joyous volume.<ref name=AH/>\n===1996 edition===\n[[File:The Marvelous Land of Snergs (1996).jpg|thumb|left|Cover of the 1996 edition]]\n{{Quote|An unconscious source-book! for the Hobbits...|[[J.R.R.

Now, for the first time in nearly 70 years, this magical book is back in print with the original text, the classic illustrations by noted Punch artist George Morrow, and an introduction by Tolkien scholar Douglas A. Anderson. This book has garnered praise from: Charles de Lint, Humphrey Carpenter, Alison Lurie, and Jack Zipes.<ref name=Old>[http://www.oldearthbooks.com/snergs.htm E. A.
