The tune bears a remarkable resemblance to the traditional hymn \"''[https://hymnary.org/text/this_is_my_fathers_world_and_to_my This is my Father's world]''\", and the opening musical phrase is identical.  The tune is often played as a \"[[Hobbits|Hobbit]]\" or \"[[the Shire|Shire]]\" theme throughout the film.\n\nThe words are in English and follow here.\n\n==Lyrics==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nWhen the cold of Winter comes\nStarless nights will cover day\nIn the veiling of the sun\nWe will walk in bitter rain\n\nBut in dreams\nI can hear your name\nAnd in dreams\nWe will meet again\n\nWhen the seas and mountains fall\nAnd we come, to end of days\nIn the dark I hear a call\nCalling me there\nI will go there\nAnd back again\n</poem>\n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]"}}}
