It is unknown if the marshes in the south consisted of multiple marshes or one singular marsh. Regardless, however, they were also roughly fifty leagues (150  miles) south of the [[North Moors|northern moors]].<ref name=\"FRHobbits\">{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref> It is possible that the marshes in the south were actually just the [[Overbourn Marshes]],<ref>{{HM|AME}}, p. 70</ref> but this is unknown.\n\n== History ==\nIn the year {{TA|1601}} the [[Hobbits]] set out to cross the Brandywine River led by the brothers [[Marcho]] and [[Blanco]] to live in their new home of the shire. The hobbits had previously agreed with King [[Argeleb II]] on the borders of the shire, with the southern border being the marshes in the south.<ref name=\"FRHobbits\">{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Overbourn Marshes]]\n* [[North Moors]]\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Eriador]]\n[[Category:Regions of the Shire]]\n[[Category:Swamps]]"}}}
