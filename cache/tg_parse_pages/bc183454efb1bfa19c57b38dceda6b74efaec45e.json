Ker lecture''' was a yearly lecture at the University of Glasgow. It is now a full lectureship. It was instated in 1938 in honour of William Paton Ker, of whom [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] spoke with reverence in ''[[The Monsters and the Critics]]''. \n\nOn April 15, [[1953]], Tolkien was given the honour of providing this lecture. It was a discussion of ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'' and the religious themes temptation, adultery and repentance.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Humphrey Carpenter]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (eds.), ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', [[Letter 135]], note 2</ref> \n\nOn various websites with a \"Tolkien Timeline\" (a selection:[http://tolkien.cro.net/tolkien/tolktmln.html][http://gollum.usask.ca/tolkien/era3.html][http://mural.uv.es/jojise/narratime.html][http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=54131761][http://brokenwillsandsavinggrace.blogspot.com/2006/06/timeline-of-jrr-tolkien.html]), the date of this lecture is incorrectly given as [[1933]] (or \"circa 1933\"). It seems to be based on a misreading and ignorant copy-pasting. Only one site cites a source [http://gollum.usask.ca/tolkien/era3.html], [[William Ready]]'s ''[[The Tolkien Relation]]'', in which it is recorded erronously.<ref>[[William Ready]], ''[[The Tolkien Relation]]'', page 22: ''\"He gave the W.P. Ker lecture at Glasgow University in 1933...\"''</ref>\n\n==Publication==\n\nIn [[1983]], the lecture was included as the chapter \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\" in ''[[The Monsters and the Critics]]'', reprinted several times.\n\nIn [[2020]], the lecture was included in the deluxe edition of ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl and Sir Orfeo]]''.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.universitystory.gla.ac.uk/chair-and-lectureship/?id=141 University of Glasgow]\n* {{WP|William Paton Ker}}\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Lectures]]\n[[Category:Lectures by J.R.R.
