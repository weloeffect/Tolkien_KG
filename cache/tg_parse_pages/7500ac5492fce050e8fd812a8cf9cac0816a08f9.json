As the two hobbits call out for him, he struggles with himself about the treatment he received at the hands of [[Faramir]] and his men. Sméagol whimpers \"[[Frodo|Master]] looks after us\", while Gollum says Frodo betrayed them and the two hobbits should be killed, and [[The One Ring|the Ring]] retrieved. Sméagol voices his fear that Sam knows of their villainy, and that it would be too risky to kill them. \n\nAs Frodo and Sam come nearer, Gollum says thoughtfully \"We could let ''her'' do it\", to which Sméagol eagerly agrees. \n{{blockquote|And then we takes it once they're dead.|[[Gollum]]}}\nSmiling, Gollum comes out from the tree he was hiding behind and says to Frodo and Sam they have a long way to go on their journey yet and that \"Sméagol will show you the way\".\n\n==Differences==\nA broader point of divergence between the films and the book is the plan of Gollum. In this scene, Gollum and Sméagol together agree at this point to kill the hobbits and take the Ring back for themselves. In the book however, a passage in the chapter \"[[The Stairs of Cirith Ungol]]\", where Gollum returns to find Frodo and Sam asleep during their journey up the [[Stairs of Cirith Ungol|stairs]], suggests that Gollum had second thoughts about leading the two hobbits to [[Shelob]],<ref>{{TT|Stairs}}, p. 714</ref> even at this late stage. \n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers scenes|66]]"}}}
