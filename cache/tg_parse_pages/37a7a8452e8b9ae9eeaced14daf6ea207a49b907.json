This was the realm to the west of the [[Blue Mountains]] and [[Eriador]]. \n\nIn the days before the awakening of the [[Elves]], [[Morgoth]] had built the great fortress of [[Utumno]] and a secondary fortress called [[Angband]] that served as an outpost of his realm. Both of these fortresses had been destroyed by the [[Valar]]. Yet when Morgoth escaped and returned to Middle-earth, he raised anew the fortress of Angband and made it even stronger. Morgoth raised three mighty pillars of slag called [[Thangorodrim]] to cover the fortress. He also delved great tunnels and pits into the earth, where his armies would grow and great smithies would forge weapons for them.\n\nTo the west of Angband was the realm of [[Hithlum]], or Hísilóme the land of Mist in [[Quenya]], for it was called this due to the great smoke Morgoth created when the Noldor first came to Beleriand. This was ruled by [[Fingolfin]]. His son [[Fingon]] received the rule of [[Dor-lómin]]. The region became known for its horses and cavalry.\n\nTo the west of Hithulm was the land of [[Nevrast]], ruled by the other son of Fingolfin named [[Turgon]]. This was a land circled by mountains and hills. The land itself was wet and had many marshes. Turgon's halls were in [[Vinyamar]].\n\nTo the south of [[Ard-galen]] was the highland of [[Dorthonion]], a land of forests ruled by [[Angrod]] and [[Aegnor]], two brothers of [[Finrod Felagund]] who served as his vassals. The tower of [[Minas Tirith (Beleriand)|Minas Tirith]], manned by Finrod's last brother [[Orodreth]],<ref>{{S|14}} In ''The Silmarillion'' as currently published, Orodreth is referred to as Finrod's brother, rather than his nephew. This page will refer to Orodreth as Finrod's brother to maintain parity with the current text.</ref> was in [[Tol Sirion]] between Dorthonion and the [[Shadowy Mountains]].\n\nBeleriand itself was a land criss-crossed by rivers such as the [[Narog]], but the greatest river was the [[Sirion]], which ran down the length of Beleriand and cut it into eastern and western halves. Finrod became the ruler of all Elves on the western half except for the Elves of the [[Falas]], who were led by [[Círdan]]. But both he and Finrod were allies, and together they built havens in [[Brithombar]] and [[Eglarest]].\n\nOn the middle of Beleriand, [[Thingol]] was the mightiest Elf-lord, ruling the realm of [[Doriath]]. On his northern border was the horrible [[Nan Dungortheb]] where evil spiders dwelt. Doriath extended from Sirion in the west border to the river [[Aros]] in the south and east.\n\nSirion was not the only great river of Berleriand. It had tributaries such as the River [[Narog]]. Where the Narog river flowed into the [[Ringwil]] was a great gorge, where Finrod Felagund founded the realm of Nargothrond. It was a hidden city, protected by both the river and the gorge. \n\nTo the east of Doriath was the territory of the [[Sons of Fëanor]] in [[East Beleriand]]. This region was cut in pieces by the River Gelion and its tributaries. In the south six rivers broke off it, giving the region the name of [[Ossiriand]], the land of seven rivers. This was the home of the [[Green-elves]] who had never left Beleriand on the [[Great Journey]]. This land would later be known as [[Lindon]] in later days.\n\nTo the north of Ossirand was the lands owned by the Sons of Fëanor. Maedhros owned the northernmost territory that was closest to [[Angband]], for it was a flat and open area that was vulnerable to attack. This would be known as the [[March of Maedhros]]. His capital was a fortress named [[Himring]]. [[Maglor]] his brother guarded the territory to the east where there was a gap in the hills.\n[[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]] would be rulers of the land to the south in [[Aglon]]. [[Caranthir]] ruled the land along the river Gelion beside the [[Blue Mountains]], and here he would have dealings with the [[Dwarves]] of [[Nogrod]] and [[Belegost]]. Finally, [[Amrod]] and [[Amras]] controlled the southernmost part of East Beleriand on the western side of Gelion.\n\n{{references}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.entmoot.com/showthread.php?t=9495 Chapter discussion at Entmoot.com]\n\n[[fr:tolkien/resumes/silm/qs14]]\n[[fi:Beleriandista ja sen valtakunnista (Silmarillion)]]"}}}
