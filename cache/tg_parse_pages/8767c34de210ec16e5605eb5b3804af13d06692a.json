He was the producer of the [[The Hobbit (1967 film)|first animated film]] of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' in 1967. The film was directed by [[Gene Deitch]] and was made in under a month. The running time for the film was a minuscule twelve minutes and was produced simply so that Snyder could extend his license for ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and sell it back to Tolkien and his publishers for $100,000.\n\n== External Links ==\n* {{WP|William L.
