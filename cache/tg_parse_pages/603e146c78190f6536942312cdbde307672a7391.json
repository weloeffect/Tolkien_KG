He did not support the idea of destroying [[The One Ring|the Ring]], and preferred instead the notion of guarding it from [[Sauron]], perhaps with the aid of [[Tom Bombadil|Iarwain ben-adar]]. His suggestion was countered by [[Glorfindel]], as well as [[Galdor of the Havens|Galdor]], as they did not believe that Iarwain had the power to defy Sauron's.<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref> \n\nErestor accompanied [[Arwen]] to her marriage with [[Aragorn]] in [[Gondor]] in {{TA|3019}}.<ref>{{RK|Steward}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Erestor'' is in [[Sindarin]], but its meaning is unclear.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-337200237.html|articlename=S.

In a further update, the other two were made into unnamed Elf-lords of Rivendell, with Erestor being the sole remaining half-elf and kinsman of Elrond.<ref>{{RS|Elrond}}</ref> However, Erestor is never called a half-elf in the finished text. \n\nIn the initial selection for the Nine of the Company of the Ring, Erestor was to represent the half-Elves.<ref>{{TI|Ring}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, only Elrond, [[Galadriel]], and [[Celeborn]] accompany Arwen to her wedding.<ref>{{SD|Vs}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"180px\" heights=\"180px\">\nFile:Decipher - Erestor.jpg|Erestor from ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Erestor.jpg|Erestor in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n\n'''2001-2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'':'''\n:A Decipher card identifies one of the Elves at the [[Council of Elrond]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', played by Jonathan Harding, as Erestor.\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Prior to the Fellowship's departure from [[Rivendell]], Erestor is involved in a quest exclusive to the Elven characters.
