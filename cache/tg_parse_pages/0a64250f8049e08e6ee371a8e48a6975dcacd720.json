It was used by [[Galadriel]], the [[Lady of Lórien]], in [[Caras Galadhon]]. Galadriel could not predict what the Mirror would show and did not guarantee that its visions would come to pass.<ref name=\"mirror\">{{FR|II7}}, pp. 362-4</ref> The [[Phial of Galadriel]] contained water from the basin<ref name=\"farewell\">{{FR|II8}}, p. 376</ref>.\n\n==History==\n===Frodo's vision===\nOn [[15 February]] {{TA|3019}}<ref name=\"february\">{{App|B3}}, p. 1092</ref>, while the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] were staying in [[Lothlórien]], Galadriel invited [[Frodo Baggins]] to look into the Mirror.<ref name=\"mirror\" />\n\nIn the ensuing vision, Frodo saw a long grey road upon which a far away figure strode. As the figure approached, it reminded him of [[Gandalf]], who he believed to be deceased after the [[Order of Wizards|Wizard]]'s battle with the [[Balrogs|Balrog]] [[Durin's Bane]] in [[Moria]]. However, the figure was clad in white instead of the Wizard's typical grey apparel. The figure's head was bowed, and Frodo could not make out whose face it bore before it walked down a bend in the road and left the Mirror's view. Frodo pondered whether this figure was Gandalf on a journey long ago or whether it was [[Saruman]].<ref name=\"mirror\" />\n\nThe vision changed, and Frodo glimpsed [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], who was walking in a room while it rained outside. After a pause, many swift visions followed. Frodo experienced a vision of the [[Sea]], which he had never seen in person, as it raged in a great storm. Following this, he saw a black outline of a tall ship sailing up out of the West, a wide river flowing through a city, and a white fortress with seven towers. Once again, he glimpsed a tall ship, though this time it bore a banner with the emblem of a [[White Tree of Gondor|white tree]]. A great smoke then arose in his vision, and the red sun set into a grey mist. A ship passed into this mist, and Frodo drew away from the Mirror.<ref name=\"mirror\" />\n\nHowever, as he drew away, the Mirror went dark and Frodo gazed into its emptiness. In this emptiness, an Eye slowly grew until it filled the Mirror. The Eye was \"rimmed with fire, but was itself glazed, yellow as a cat's, watchful and intent, and the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing\". The vision of the Eye was so frightening that Frodo stood frozen in terror. The Eye began to search, and Frodo knew that he was one of the things that it sought. The [[One Ring|Ring]] that hung on a chain around the [[Hobbits|Hobbit]]'s neck grew heavy, and his head was dragged toward the Mirror, causing him to begin slipping forward.<ref name=\"mirror\" />\n\nGaladriel warned Frodo not to touch the water of the Mirror, and the vision began to fade. Frodo looked into the Mirror and saw the [[stars]] above reflected in the basin. He stepped away, and remained shaken by his visions. Perceiving that Frodo had seen the Dark Lord [[Sauron]], she assured him that he was safe in Lothlórien.<ref name=\"mirror\" />\n\n===Sam's vision===\n[[Samwise Gamgee]] was also allowed a vision, which began with a pale-looking Frodo asleep under a dark cliff. Sam then saw himself walking down a dark passage and climbing an endless winding staircase as he searched for something, though he did not know what. The vision shifted, and he saw far away trees as they fell to the ground. He then glimpsed [[Ted Sandyman]] felling trees along the avenue near the [[Old Mill]] that led to the [[Bywater]]. However, Sam noticed that the Old Mill was gone and was instead replaced with a large brick building where many people were at work. Filled with anger and perceiving that there was trouble in [[The Shire]], Sam demanded that he must go home. However, Galadriel cooled the Hobbit's temper and assured him that not all visions in the Mirror had come to pass, nor would they necessarily come to pass, and advised him to continue on the [[Quest of the Ring]] with Frodo.<ref name=\"mirror\" />\n\n==Inspiration==\nThe Mirror of Galadriel recalls the ancient practice of water scrying or hydromancy, which involves gazing into a shallow pool or bowl for purposes of divination.<ref>{{Cite web|articleurl=https://www.britannica.com/topic/hydromancy|articlename=Hydromancy|author=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|articleurl=https://www.britannica.com/topic/crystal-gazing|articlename=Crystal Gazing|author=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===The Mirror of Galadriel in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings (1978 film) - Mirror of Galadriel.png|[[Samwise Gamgee|Samwise]], [[Galadriel]] and [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] in front of the Mirror of Galadriel in [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]\nFile:Angus McBride - Mirror of Galadriel.jpg|The Mirror of Galadriel in the ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Rings - Frodo and the Mirror of Galadriel.png|[[Frodo Baggins]] gazes apprehensively into the Mirror of Galadriel in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Mirror of Galadriel.jpg|The Mirror of Galadriel in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\nFile:Kasia 'Kafis' Zielinska - Mirror of Galadriel.jpg|The Mirror of Galadriel in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-earth]]''\n</gallery>\n'''[[1978]]: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''\n\n:In [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s animated film adaptation, both Frodo and Sam look into the Mirror. The Mirror shows swirls of color, and a mesmerized Frodo bends forward toward it, though Galadriel stops him before he can touch its water.\n\n'''[[2001]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''\n:In [[Peter Jackson|Peter Jackson]]'s adaptation, only Frodo looks into the Mirror. He is shown a vision of reminiscent of \"[[The Scouring of the Shire]]\" chapter in the novel. Hobbits, including Merry, Pippin, and Sam, are shown walking while being whipped by [[Orcs]]. The vision ends with a glimpse of the flaming Eye of Sauron as The Ring emerges from Frodo's shirt, dangling from its chain and nearly touching the water in the Mirror.\n\n'''[[2008]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Lady Galadriel consults the Mirror at multiple points during the story. During the [[2008]] ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria|Mines of Moria]]'' expansion, she gives the player's character a prediction of their future. These visions vary for each playable character class. Some classes' predictions came to pass within the next few years, while others only occurred within story updates added over a decade later, and some have not yet come to pass at all.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://middle-earth.xenite.org/how-does-the-mirror-of-galadriel-work/ How Does the Mirror of Galadriel Work?] by [[Michael Martinez]]\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Objects]]\n[[Category:Magic]]\n[[de:Galadriels Spiegel]]\n[[fi:Galadrielin peili]]"}}}
