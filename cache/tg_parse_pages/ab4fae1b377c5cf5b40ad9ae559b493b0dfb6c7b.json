He was an extremely enormous and powerful creature, more than one hundred miles long, allegedly causing storms just by passing through the world. The [[Man-in-the-Moon]] had once tried to seal the Sea-serpent with his magic, but took fifty years to create the proper magic, and succeeded, though accidentally causing an entire [[Atlantis|continent]] to sink. During the time of the story, the [[Wizard]] [[Artaxerxes]] received written ''[[Complaints]]'' about the Sea-serpent allegedly waking up and moving to a new den that was in a cave that was very close to the mer-king's palace. Unfortunately, when Mr. Artaxerxes went to deal with him, [[Rover|Roverandom]] followed him and bit the tail of a shark in the shell carriage, causing a domino effect which ended with the last shark in the carriage biting the Sea-serpent. The awakening was further accelerated when Mr. Artaxerxes tried to put it back to sleep, causing him to dream that he was being burnt alive by a volcano. Earthquakes and hurricanes followed as the Sea-serpent continuously rolled over until he spoke loudly that he would only go back to sleep if Mr. Artaxerxes was banished. The Mer-people accepted his terms and banished the Wizard.<ref name=rover4>{{Rover|4}}</ref> The Sea-serpent presumably went back to sleep.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:Kent Burles - Water Drakes.png|thumb|Water Drake in ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing|MERP]]'', by Kent Burles]]\n'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''\n: Water Drakes, or Water Serpents, are drakes who have adapted to a life in freshwater pools or in the ocean.
