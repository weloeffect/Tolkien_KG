Tolkien]] sometime after January [[1968]]. The fragment was edited by [[Carl F. Hostetter]] and published in ''[[Tolkien Studies: Volume 6]]'' ([[2009]], pp.&nbsp;183–8), and later in ''[[The Nature of Middle-earth]]'' ([[2021]], Part 2, chapter XI).\n\nThe essay (or rather, notes) consists of a philosophical discussion of [[Eldar]]in thoughts on the nature and relations of fate, free will and the created world. These were presented in the context of a linguistic discussion of Elvish phonology (of the two [[Quenya]] words ''[[ambar]]'' 'world' and ''[[Umbar (word)|umbar]]'' 'fate').\n\n==External links==\n*[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/tolkien_studies/summary/v006/6.tolkien.html Excerpt from ''Fate and Free Will'' on Project Muse]\n\n[[Category:Manuscripts by J.R.R.
