Located in the [[Misty Mountains]], it was the home of the [[Longbeards]] and was later populated with [[Firebeards]] and [[Broadbeams]] fleeing [[Nogrod]] and [[Belegost]]. It prospered for thousands of years until the Dwarves awoke the [[Balrogs|Balrog]] which drove them from Khazad-dȗm, it was then renamed ''[[Moria]]'' (\"Black Pit\" in [[Sindarin]]).<br>It is told that a few centuries into the [[Fourth Age]], [[Durin VII]] – a descendant (some sources say the son)<ref name=\"Making\">{{PM|Aiv}}, pp. 278-9.</ref> of [[Thorin III Stonehelm]] – at last led Durin's Folk back to recolonize [[Khazad-dûm]], where they remained \"until the world grew old and the Dwarves failed and the days of Durin's race were ended\".<ref name=\"Making\" />\n\n* '''[[Nogrod]] and [[Belegost]] '''were located in the [[Blue Mountains]]. The [[Firebeards]] and [[Broadbeams]] awoke in the [[Blue Mountains]], and lived there throughout the history of their people. These two houses built the great Dwarven cities of [[Nogrod]] and [[Belegost]] in the Blue Mountains. It is not clear whether they shared the two cities or whether each house dwelt in its own.<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref> Nogrod and Belegost were ruined at the end of the [[First Age]], leaving the Firebeards and the Broadbeams to either rebuild their halls or, as many did relocate to Khazad-dȗm in {{SA|40}}.<br>The '''''Ered Luin''''' would later become a refuge for much of Durin's folk who established [[Thorin's Halls]] beyond the [[Lune]]<ref name=\"Folk\">{{App|Durin}}</ref> during the latter Third Age. However, the Firebeards and Broadbeams continued to live there through the Fourth Age, and probably till the diminishing of the race of Dwarves (there always remained some Dwarves on the eastern side of the Blue Mountains in days afterwards.)<ref>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>\n\n* The '''Exiled Kingdom in the [[Grey Mountains]]''' were the [[Dáin's Halls|great halls]] of which many of Durin's folk relocated to after being exiled from Khazad-dȗm.  The [[Dwarves of the Grey Mountains]] became very prosperous in their new halls. For over 500 years they mined and defended their halls from the [[Dragons]] of the north and the Orcs from the west. Until, finally [[Cold-drakes]] forced them from the mountains, and killed their king [[Dain |Dain I]]. However, dwarves still remained in the Ered Mithrin throughout the Third and Fourth Age after the core population fled, surviving in whatever mines and halls were remaining.<ref name=\"Folk\" />\n\n* The '''[[Kingdom under the Mountain]]''' was one of the greatest kingdoms of the Dwarves.  Located at [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], it was founded by [[Thráin I]], but was abandoned by his son, [[Thorin I]].  It was resettled by [[Thrór]] but, years later, [[Smaug]] [[Sack of Erebor|sacked]] the mountain and drove the Dwarves out.  [[Thorin|Thorin II Oakenshield]] refounded the kingdom in {{TA|2941}} at the cost of his life.\n\n* The '''[[Iron Hills]]''' were a range of small mountains rich with iron, colonized by Durin's folk during the [[First Age]]. Around the year 2500 of the Third Age, [[Grór]] son of [[Dáin I]] founded the Iron Hills as an independent kingdom after the Dwarves were exiled from the [[Grey Mountains]], and he became the first [[Lord of the Iron Hills]]. The exiles who settled in the Iron Hills were of course in friendly relations with the Dwarves of the [[Lonely Mountain]] (Erebor), who were of similar like and mind, being kin to Grór and [[Thrór]]. After the [[Battle of Five Armies]], many [[Dwarves of the Iron Hills]] relocated to the [[Lonely Mountain]] after the kingdom of Erebor was re-founded.\n\n* The '''[[Glittering Caves]]''' '''of [[Glittering Caves|Aglarond]]''' were a cave system in the [[White Mountains]] behind [[Helm's Deep]].  [[Gimli]] son of [[Glóin]] led a large group of [[Dwarves of Erebor]] there after the [[War of the Ring]] and became the [[Lord of the Glittering Caves]]. His Dwarves performed great services for the [[Rohirrim]] and the [[Men of Gondor]], of which the most famous was the making of new gates for Minas Tirith, forged out of ''[[mithril]]'' and steel.<ref name=\"Folk\" /> The dwarves of Aglarond restored the Hornburg following the War of the Ring, and it became a fortress they shared with the Rohirrim. The Dwarves of the Glittering Caves carefully tended the stone walls and opened new ways and chambers and hung lamps that filled the caverns with light.<ref>{{TT|Road}}</ref>\n\n* '''[[Rhûn]]''' was inhabited by four of the Dwarf clans: the [[Ironfists]], [[Stiffbeards]], [[Blacklocks]] and [[Stonefoots]].<ref>{{PM|X}}, pp. 301, 322 (note 24)</ref> The distance between their mansions in the East and the [[Misty Mountains]], specifically [[Gundabad]], was said to be as great or greater than that of Gundabad's distance from the [[Blue Mountains]] in the West.<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}, p. 301</ref> In the [[Third Age]], Dwarves of those kingdoms journeyed out of Rhûn to join all Middle-earth's other Dwarf clans in the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]], which was fought in and under the [[Misty Mountains]]. After this war, the survivors returned home. Late in the Third Age, when war and terror grew in Rhûn itself, considerable numbers of its Dwarves left their ancient homelands. They sought refuge in Middle-earth's western lands, where some of them met [[Frodo Baggins]].<ref>{{FR|Shadow}}</ref>\n\n* The '''Exiled Realm in [[Dunland]]''' was established by Dwarves fleeing from [[Erebor]] after it was sacked by [[Smaug]]. This is where [[Thrór]] departed when he and his companion [[Nár]] journeyed to [[Moria]] in TA 2790. After the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]], provoked by the [[Orcs]]' brutal slaying of Thrór, [[Thráin|Thráin II]] and [[Thorin]] led the remnants of their followers back to Dunland but soon left (to eventually settle in the [[Ered Luin]]).\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Dwarven realms]]\t\n[[Category:Dwarves]]\n[[de:Zwerge#Bekannte Zwergenstädte]]"}}}
