Fang was one of the three large, wolf-like dogs, (the other two were named '[[Grip]]' and '[[Wolf (dog)|Wolf]]'). \n\nThese ferocious but well-trained animals lived at his farm at the time of the [[War of the Ring]], but he had evidently kept other dogs before these. [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] had frightening memories of Maggot's dogs going back some thirty years, but the dogs that had threatened him three decades earlier could hardly have been Fang, Grip or Wolf.<ref>{{FR|I4}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nFang means \"canine tooth\" but was also an archaic English verb meaning \"[[grip]]\".<ref name=\"Nomen\">{{HM|N}}, p. 757</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Fang in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Fang (dog).jpg|''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\nFile:Andrea Piparo - Farmer Maggot (WotR TCG).jpg|''[[War of the Ring: The Card Game]]''\n</gallery>\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Fang, along with [[Wolf (dog)|Wolf]] and [[Grip]], is found next to [[Farmer Maggot]] in [[Bamfurlong]].
