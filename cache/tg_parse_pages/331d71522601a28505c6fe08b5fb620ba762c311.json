Tolkien]], edited by [[Brian Sibley]] as a single book and published in [[2022]]. It collects all the published materials concerning the [[Second Age]] of [[Middle-earth]], presenting them for the first time in a single volume.\n\nInstead of the usual [[The West of Middle-earth at the End of the Third Age|map of Middle-earth]], it includes a reproduction of the older [[General Map of Middle-earth]], showing the Havens of [[Umbar]] and the Cape of [[Forochel]]. The map is a post-1970 [[Allen and Unwin|Allen & Unwin]] version, taking the [[Glanduin]] and [[Swanfleet]] from the [[A Map of Middle-earth|Pauline Baynes Map]] and erroneously applying them to the upper course of the [[Isen]] (instead of a tributary of the [[Gwathló]]).<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. lxvi</ref>\n\nThe texts were previously published in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', and ''[[The Nature of Middle-earth]]'', edited by [[Christopher Tolkien]] and [[Carl F. Hostetter]]. No [[Unpublished material|new material]] by Tolkien is presented in this book. The book is illustrated by [[Alan Lee]].\n\n==Contents==\n* About this Book\n* Introduction: The Saga of 'A Dark Age'\n* Before the Second Age\n\n* '''The Tale of Years (Chronology of the Westlands)'''\n\n*Appendices:\n**A: A Brief Chronicle of the Third Age of Middle-earth\n**B: The Númenórean chapters from ''[[The Lost Road]]''\n\n*Notes\n\n==From the publisher==\n{{blockquote|Presenting for the first time in one volume the events of the Second Age as written by J.R.R. Tolkien and originally and masterfully edited for publication by Christopher Tolkien, this new volume will include pencil drawings and colour paintings by Alan Lee, who also illustrated ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit'' and went on to win an Academy Award for his work on ''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy.\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien famously described the Second Age of Middle-earth as a 'dark age, and not very much of its history is (or need be) told'. And for many years readers would need to be content with the tantalizing glimpses of it found within the pages of The Lord of the Rings and its appendices. It was not until Christopher Tolkien presented ''The Silmarillion'' for publication in 1977 that a fuller story could be told for, though much of its content concerned the First Age of Middle-earth, there were at its close two key works that revealed the tumultuous events concerning the rise and fall of the island-kingdom of Númenor, the Forging of the Rings of Power, the building of the Barad-dûr and the rise of Sauron, and the Last Alliance of Elves and Men.\n\nChristopher Tolkien provided even greater insight into the Second Age in ''Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth'' in 1980, and expanded upon this in his magisterial 12-volume ''History of Middle-earth'', in which he presented and discussed a wealth of further tales written by his father, many in draft form.\n\nNow, using ‘The Tale of Years’ in ''The Lord of the Rings'' as a starting point, Brian Sibley has assembled from the various published texts in a way that tells for the very first time in one volume the tale of the Second Age of Middle-earth, whose events would ultimately lead to the Third Age, and the War of the Ring, as told in ''The Lord of the Rings''.}}\n\n==Publication history and gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"125px\" heights=\"125px\">\nFile:The Fall of Númenor.jpg|2022 hardcover\nFile:The Fall of Númenor deluxe.jpeg|2022 hardcover deluxe edition\nFile:The Fall of Númenor Large Print.jpeg|2023 paperback large print\nFile:The Fall of Númenor 2024.jpg|2024 paperback\n</gallery>\n*[[HarperCollins]] hardcover ([[2022]]), pp.&nbsp;352.
