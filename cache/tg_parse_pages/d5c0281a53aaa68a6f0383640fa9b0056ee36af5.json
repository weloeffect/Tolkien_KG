It was formed by the merger of American ''Harper & Row'' (which dates to the 1817 foundation of ''Harper & Brothers'' and was acquired by News Corp in 1987) and ''William Collins & Sons'' (which was founded in 1819 and acquired by News Corp,and merged with Harper,in 1989).\n\nHarperCollins  has held the rights for publishing the works of Tolkien in Europe and Canada since it acquired [[Unwin Hyman]]\nin 1994,and in 2021 it acquired the trade book division  of [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] (long the official publisher in the United States). It now publishes the American editions under its ''William Morrow'' imprint (though some Houghton Mifflin\nHarcourt copies remain on bookstore shelves until exhausted) and the HarperCollins imprint elsewhere.\n\nHarperCollins also holds an archive of the correspondence between [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and [[Allen & Unwin]], his original publishers.\n==History==\n[[Milton Waldman]] was senior editor at Collins and met [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] during a time he was in disagreement with George Allen & Unwin. Despite Waldman's initial interest in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Collins was concerned about its length, and there were delays. In the spring of [[1952]], Tolkien lost patience and threatened to withdraw the manuscript; Collins decided that they must decline both ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.<ref>{{L|133}}</ref>\n\nIn [[1956]] Waldman unsuccessfully attempted to publish ''[[The Hobbit]]'' in Collin's Fontana paperback series. \n\nIn [[1989]] [[Grafton]] became a part of HarperCollins.<ref>[http://208.100.59.10/wiki/index.php/Publisher:Grafton Publisher:Grafton] at [http://208.100.59.10/wiki/index.php/Main_Page Internet Speculative Fiction Database] (accessed 31 May 2011)</ref><ref>{{WP|Grafton_(publisher)}} (accessed 31 May 2011)</ref>\n\nAround [[1994]] HarperCollins bought [[Unwin Hyman]] succeeding the company as Tolkien's primary publisher. That year ''The Lord of the Rings'' was reset in electronic form for ease of editing and correction, but not without introducing some new errors, which not only remained in subsequent editions, but also leaked out to the American editions based on that setting. Some of them were corrected in the editions of [[2002]], [[2004]], and the [[2005]] reprint.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. xl</ref>\n\nHarperCollins purchased the rights for all books relating to [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]].<ref>\"[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2001_Jan_16/ai_69205665 Houghton Mifflin Acquires U.S. Book Rights to New Line Cinema's 'The Lord of the Rings' Movie Trilogy]\" (accessed 27 January 2011)</ref>\n\nCurrently, it is involved in the production of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'' series, in conjuction with [[Tolkien Estate]], [[The Tolkien Trust]] and [[New Line Cinema]], although the main producer is [[Amazon.com Incorporated|Amazon]].<ref>{{webcite|author=John Koblin|dated=13 November 2017|articleurl=http://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/arts/television/lord-of-the-rings-series-amazon.html|articlename=‘Lord of the Rings’ Series Coming to Amazon|website=[https://www.nytimes.com/ New York Times]|accessed=8 January 2022}}</ref>\n{{references}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://harpercollins.co.uk/pages/tolkien The Tolkien Online Bookshop] (maintained by HarperCollins)\n*[https://www.harpercollins.co.uk/ Official website]\n*[http://www.harpercollins.ca/ Official website] (Canada)\n\n[[Category:British businesses]]\n[[Category:Publishers]]\n[[de:HarperCollins]]\n[[fi:HarperCollins]]"}}}
