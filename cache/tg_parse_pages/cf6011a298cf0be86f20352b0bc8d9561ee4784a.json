They started fearing the [[Gift of Men]] and attempted to delay it or recall life. This growing wish to escape death made most of the Númenóreans envious of the immortal [[Eldar]], who they had come to physically resemble. The Eldar sought ever to remind the [[Men of Númenor]] however, that death was a gift of the One God, [[Ilúvatar]], to all men, and the will of Ilúvatar could not be gainsaid.<ref name=Akallabeth>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>\n\nDuring the reign of the Númenórean kings [[Tar-Ciryatan]] and [[Tar-Atanamir]], who were both greedy for wealth, the Númenóreans formed two parties, the party of the [[Faithful]], who remained faithful to the [[Valar]] and maintained their friendship with the [[Elves]] and the party of the [[King's Men]], who followed the policy of the King to oppose the [[Ban of the Valar]] that forbade to sail to [[Aman]] and did not maintain the friendship with the Elves.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}, fifteenth to twentyfourth pargraph</ref> The King's Men sailed far away to the south of Middle-earth and established lordships and strongholds<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}, twentyeighth paragraph</ref> in Umbar, Harad and many other places on the coasts of Middle-earth.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{PM|Second}}, manuscript T4, entry for the years 2000-3000</ref> The Númenóreans in the service of Tar-Ciryatan and Tar-Atanamir oppressed the men of Middle-earth and levied heavy tribute from the men of the coasts and their ships brought back metals and gems from Middle-earth.<ref>{{UT|Kings}}, entry XII ''Tar-Ciryatan'' and entry XIII ''Tar-Atanamir''</ref>\n\nThree of the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]] were Númenóreans lords corrupted by [[Sauron]].<ref name=Akallabeth/> Over 1000 years<ref>{{App|SA}}, entry for the year 2251, p. 1083</ref> before the [[Downfall of Númenor|Downfall]], they served [[Sauron]], being enslaved to his will.\n\n==History==\n===Second Age===\n====Origin====\nMany of the [[King's Men]] who had sailed to the shores and seaward regions in the south of [[Middle-earth]] and established fortresses and dwellings during [[Sauron]]'s sojourn in [[Númenor]] were already bent to the will of Sauron.<ref name=Rings>{{S|Rings}}</ref> As a consequence, the King's Men hated the followers of Elendil.

Two Black Númenóreans, [[Herumor]] and [[Fuinur]] rose to power among the [[Haradrim]] in the lands south of Mordor.<ref name=Rings/>\n\nAs [[Sauron]] was preparing to go to [[War of the Last Alliance|war]] against the [[Elves]] and [[Exiles of Númenor|Exiles]], he gathered great strength of his servants from the south, including many Black Númenóreans.<ref name=Rings/> \n\n===Decline===\nAfter the fall of Sauron in the [[War of the Last Alliance]], the race of the Black Númenóreans \"dwindled\" swiftly or \"became merged with the [[Men]] of [[Middle-earth]]\".<ref name=Gondor/> However, their descendants retained control over Umbar and inherited their hatred of [[Gondor]].<ref name=Gondor/>\n\nAlthough the race of the Black Númenóreans had dwindled, a few notable figures were Black Númenóreans in later times. One of these was [[Berúthiel|Queen Berúthiel]], the \"nefarious, solitary, and loveless\" wife of [[Gondor|Gondor's]] King [[Tarannon Falastur]], who ruled from {{TA|830}} until {{TA|913}} who had her exiled from Gondor and her name erased from the [[Book of the Kings]].<ref name=Interview>{{webcite|author=[[Daphne Castell]]|articleurl=http://www.festivalintheshire.com/journal1bdx/inttolkien.html|articlename=The Realms of Tolkien|dated=|website=[http://www.festivalintheshire.com/journal1bdx/index.html ''Festival in the Shire Journal'', Issue 1]|accessed=7 May 2012}}</ref><ref>[[Humphrey Carpenter]], ''[[The Inklings (book)|The Inklings]]'', \"Thursday evenings\", pp. 137-8</ref><ref>{{UT|Istari}}, note 7</ref> \n\nIn {{TA|933}},<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 933, p. 1085</ref> [[Kings of Gondor|King]] [[Eärnil I]] captured [[Umbar]], driving the lords of Umbar into exile.<ref name=Eärnil>{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Eärnil I, p. 1044</ref> 82 years later, in {{TA|1015}},<ref name=Ciryandil>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1015, p. 1085</ref> these lords led the [[Haradrim]] in a siege of Umbar<ref name=Eärnil/> during which King [[Ciryandil]] of Gondor, the son of Eärnil I, was killed.<ref name=Ciryandil/><ref group=note>It is not known if these lords were Black Númenóreans.

If the Mouth lived in the [[Second Age]], he would be one of the King's Men of Númenor, and probably prolonged his life with sorcery (cf. {{HM|Guide}}, entry '''Mouth of Sauron''', p. 274); in the second interpretation he would serve [[Sauron]] only for 68 years, and this would make him a Black Númenórean of the Third Age of Umbar or [[Harad]].

Sauron was probably most active in Near Harad and Far Harad, because those regions were a source for man-power for him, but the people of Harad could probably also be converted more easily to resist against Sauron than those of other regions in the south.<ref>{{UT|Istari}}, note from before the publication of the second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' in 1966 about Gandalf's possible journeys to Harad in the \"earlier days of his labours\"</ref> It is not known, whether \"absorbed\" meant that the settlements were conquered by other Men of Middle-earth, that the Men of Númenor in those settlements intermarried with other people from Middle-earth or that the settlements were absorbed by the sea during the floods that were caused by the drowning of Númenor on the shores of Middle-earth.\n\n==Culture==\nThe Black Númenóreans were \"enamoured of evil knowledge\" and worshipped [[Sauron]].<ref name=Gate/> They hated the followers of Elendil and their realm Gondor. After the fall of Sauron in the [[War of the Last Alliance]] their race \"dwindled\" swiftly or \"became merged with the Men of Middle-earth\".<ref name=Gondor/> It is not known, whether this dwindling meant that their lifespan and knowledge dwindled like that of the Dúnedain of Gondor or that their numbers dwindled.\n\nIt is possible that [[Faramir]] was referring to the King's Men or the Black Númenóreans, when he said that most of the Men of Númenor who settled far and wide on the shores and seaward regions of Middle-earth fell into eviles and follies: many became enamoured of the Darkness and of black arts, some were fully idle and lived at ease and some fought each other until they were conquered by the wild men when they were weak.<ref>{{TT|Window}}, p. 677</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Black Númenóreans in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King - Black Númenórean.jpg|Black Númenórean - ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Black Númenórean.jpg|A typical Black Númenórean in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king]]'':'''\n:The Black Númenóreans inhabit the land of [[Angmar]] and the [[Witch-king]] turns their allegiance to him to help fight against [[Arnor]].
