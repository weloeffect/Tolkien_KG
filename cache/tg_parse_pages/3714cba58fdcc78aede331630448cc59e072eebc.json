Thorin was the heir of [[Durin|Durin the Deathless]] being the great-grandson of [[Durin VI]].<ref name=\"AppA\">{{App|A3}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThorin was born after his father Thráin had led the [[Dwarves of Moria]] away from [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] and had founded the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] in [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. Thorin himself became [[King under the Mountain]] in {{TA|2190}}. However, he heard that the majority of the remnants of [[Durin's Folk]] were now gathering in the [[Grey Mountains]]. In {{TA|2210}} he decided to leave the Lonely Mountain and reunited its people with [[Dwarves of the Grey Mountains|their brethren]] in the Grey Mountains, which were rich and largely unexplored.\n\nThorin I died in {{TA|2289|n}}, at the age of 254, and was succeeded by his son [[Glóin (King of Durin's Folk)|Glóin]]. His sixth great-grandson, [[Thorin|Thorin II Oakenshield]], was the much famed leader of the [[Quest of Erebor]], which reclaimed the Lonely Mountain from the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Smaug]].<ref name=\"AppA\"/><ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThorin's name is one from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''.
