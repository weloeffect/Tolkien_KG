This radio series with a full cast of characters was a rare co-production between [[wikipedia:Slovakia|Slovakia]]'s public radio broadcaster and a Slovak private radio. On a legal level, the adaptation was fully approved by the [[Tolkien Estate]]. \n\nThe series was written and adapted for radio by playwright and author Viliam Klimáček and directed by Jaro Rihák. The soundtrack for the series was composed by Peter Mankovecký.\nThe ''Pán prsteňov'' radio series consisted of eighteen episodes of 50+ minutes runtime, divided into six episodes per annual series. The three series first aired in the late autumn of 2001, the autumn of 2002 and the summer and autumn of 2003.

Notably, this is one of the few adaptations of the novel in a different medium - be it radio or film - that omits very little of the original storyline, preserving even many of the minor and frequently omitted characters.\n\nThe first volume's prologue concerning hobbits and the events of Bilbo's 111th birthday from the first chapter are briefly summarized by Bilbo (the narrator) at the start of the first episode. Then the action shifts towards Frodo and Gandalf, and subsequently to Frodo and his three hobbit companions. From then on, roughly from the first third or middle of the first episode onward, very little is left out of the novel's story.\n\nThe events of the [[War of the Ring]] raging in [[Rohan]] and [[Gondor]] are captured in a format that alternates between the Frodo, Sam and Gollum part of the storyline and the other members of the Fellowship of the Ring. Though this alternating might occur in a single episode, most episodes before the reuniting of the Fellowship focus predominantly on one or the other. The eighteenth episode of the series covers the return of the four hobbits to The Shire and the events of the Scouring of the Shire and its aftermath (including Bilbo's and Frodo's departure from Middle-earth).\n\nMinor characters adapted from the novel include Gildor, Tom Bombadil, Harry Goatleaf, Barliman Butterbur, Glorfindel, Radagast the Brown, Ori, Háma, Ghân-buri-Ghân, Bergil, Hirgon and Ioreth.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!Role!!Actor\n|-\n|[[Bilbo Baggins]]||Marián Labuda Sr.\n|-\n|[[Frodo Baggins]]||Dušan Cinkota ([[The Fellowship of the Ring|FOTR]]) <br> Ľuboš Kostelný ([[The Two Towers|TTT]], [[The Return of the King|ROTK]])\n|-\n|[[Samwise Gamgee]]||Stano Dančiak\n|-\n|[[Gandalf]]||Martin Huba\n|-\n|[[Peregrin Took]]||Robert Roth\n|-\n|[[Meriadoc Brandybuck]]||Miroslav Noga\n|-\n|[[Aragorn]]||Boris Farkaš\n|-\n|[[Legolas]]||Richard Stanke\n|-\n|[[Gimli]]||Vladimír \"Ady\" Hajdu\n|-\n|[[Boromir]]||Jozef Vajda\n|-\n|[[Gildor]]||Marián Geišberg\n|-\n|[[Witch-king|Witch-king of Angmar]]||Jozef Švoňavský\n|-\n|[[Tom Bombadil]]||Milan Lasica\n|-\n|[[Barrow-wights|barrow-wight]]||Vladimír Jedľovský\n|-\n|[[Barliman Butterbur]]||Július Satinský\n|-\n|[[Harry Goatleaf]]||uncredited actor\n|-\n|[[Glorfindel]]||Marián Zednikovič\n|-\n|[[Elrond]]||Matej Landl\n|-\n|[[Arwen]]||Slávka Halčáková\n|-\n|[[Saruman]]||Andrej Hryc\n|-\n|[[Radagast]]||Vlado Černý\n|-\n|[[Ori]]||František Kovár\n|-\n|[[Galadriel]]||Soňa Norisová\n|-\n|[[Haldir]]||Milan Bahúl\n|-\n|[[Gollum]]||Ibrahim Maiga\n|-\n|[[Uglúk]]||Pavol Topoľský\n|-\n|[[Grishnakh]]||Eduard Vitek\n|-\n|[[Treebeard]]||Leopold Haverl\n|-\n|[[Théoden]]||Ladislav Chudík\n|-\n|[[Éomer]]||Ivan Romančík\n|-\n|[[Éowyn]]||Diana Mórová\n|-\n|[[Gríma Wormtongue]]||Ivan Gogál\n|-\n|[[Háma]]||Dušan Lenczi\n|-\n|[[Ghân-buri-Ghân]]||Ján Króner\n|-\n|[[Denethor]]||Marián Slovák\n|-\n|[[Faramir]]||Jozef Vajda\n|-\n|[[Beregond]]||Marek Majeský\n|-\n|[[Bergil]]||Viktor Petrov\n|-\n|[[Hirgon]]||Roman Pomajbo\n|-\n|[[Ioreth]]||Vilma Jamnická\n|-\n|[[The Mouth of Sauron]]||Juraj Slezáček\n|-\n|Mordor [[Orcs|orc]]||Jozef Šimonovič\n|-\n|Hobbit [[shirriff]]||Viliam Polónyi\n|-\n|Hobbit [[Bounders|bounder]]||Karol Čálik\n|-\n|[[Ruffian]] bandit||Martin Vitek\n|-\n|[[Ruffian]] thug||Ivan Laca\n|-\n|Additional voices <br> and background voices||Martin Nahálka <br> Juraj Hrčka <br> Milan Ondrík <br> Martin Fratrič <br> Martin Gazdík\n|}\n\nIn addition, Szidónia \"Szidi\" Tobias provided a second voice for Galadriel during the temptation scene in Lothlórien (in the last episode of the first series), and Zuzana Fialová appeared as a voice that represented the darker side of Smeágol's ego as Gollum (in an episode of the second series). The voice of the deceased dwarf Ori is heard while Gandalf immerses himself in reading the [[Book of Mazarbul]].\n\nMarián Labuda's Bilbo Baggins serves as the overarching narrator of the storyline. This is portrayed as Bilbo commenting on the War of the Ring while writing new chapters in the [[Red Book of Westmarch]], from which he reads. There is a slightly metafictional tone to Bilbo's narration, as he occasionally breaks the fourth wall and addresses his nephew Frodo (and sometimes other characters from the Fellowship) directly, with Frodo or the other characters sometimes equally breaking the fourth wall and briefly responding to Bilbo. Bilbo spends most of the story (up to his journey to the Gray Havens) already retired in Rivendell, from where he narrates, and continues writing the Red Book and the notes for it.\n\nJozef Vajda had a double-role, portraying the voices of both Boromir and Faramir. (An approach similar to that of the [[The Lord of the Rings (1955 radio series)|1955 BBC radio series]].)\n\nGoldberry is present in this adaptation, singing at Tom Bombadil's house, but has no spoken lines. Her briefly heard singing vocals seem to be portrayed by Soňa Norisová, but are uncredited.\n\nThe only major cast change in the course of the series was Frodo, Dušan Cinkota being unavailable for the second and third series and replaced in the role by Ľuboš Kostelný.\n\n==Credits==\n*Based on the works by:  [[J.R.R.

This necessitated an inability to use the translated Slovak terminology from Kořínek's not-yet-published translation, and the need to borrow and appropriately slovakize terminology from the slightly earlier Czech translation of the novel by Stanislava Pošustová (first published in the 1990s). It is important to note that the radio series' terminology is thus similar to that of the Czech translation, but not following it verbatim and often altered to varying degrees.\n\nThis creates a certain level of disparity with the (as of the early 2010s, near-complete) Slovak translations of Tolkien's Legendarium, but the different terminology used by the radio series is not hard to identify with the Slovak translations' own consistent terminology.<ref>[https://ramgad.tolkien.sk/tolkien-slovensky.html Ramgad.Tolkien.sk - \"Tolkien's works in Slovak\"].

Retrieved 30 May 2021.</ref>\n\nMany of the Czech translations for geographic terms in the Legendarium that were adopted for the radio series differ only slightly from the Slovak translations. For example, the Czech translation's ''Kraj'' (\"County\"), ''Hůrka'' (\"Little-hill\") and ''Roklinka'' (\"Little Ravine\") compared to the Slovak translation's ''Grófstvo'' (\"Shire\", \"County\", in the British sense), ''Svažiny'' (\"Hillside\" or \"Slopings\") and ''Vododol'' (\"Water-cloven Dell\") for [[The Shire]], [[Bree]] and [[Rivendell]], respectively.<ref>A common popular misconception about Kořínek's Slovak translation is that it misunderstood ''Riven-'' as \"river\", but this is actually incorrect. The ''Vodo-'' half of the invented term only refers to the waters of the river flowing through Rivendell, the water that cloved the dell into a canyon-like space over the millennia. The ''-dol'' suffix is a poetic word derived from ''dolina'' (\"valley\", \"dell\"), directly equivalent to English \"dell\" or \"dale\". Similarly, the city and kingdom of Dale in Kořínek's translation of ''The Hobbit'' is ''Údol'', from ''údolie'', \"valley\", \"dale\".</ref> ''Kraj'' and ''Roklinka'' were borrowed directly for the Slovak radio series, and ''Hůrka'' was modified to ''Hôrka'' to fit with Slovak grammar and pronunciation rules.\n\nOne of the more excessive and controversial elements of the Czech translation's terminology carried over into the Slovak radio series was the consistent use of ''Železný pás'' (in Czech, ''Železný pas'', \"Iron Girdle\") to refer to [[Isengard]]. The Czech translation refers to Isengard as \"Iron Girdle\", despite Tolkien's own insistence that this is one of the many geographic terms that shouldn't be translated.\n\nIn the Czech translation, Meriadoc, Merry for short, is known by the more slavicized name ''Smělmír'' (roughly, \"Laughric\") and its nickname form ''Smíšek'' (\"Laughy\"). Kořínek's Slovak translation avoided slavicization and rendered the name as the more Frankish-sounding ''Chicholm'' and ''Chicho'' (derived from ''chichot'', the noun for \"merry giggling\"), in an effort to retain consistency with the rest of the Frankish-sounding hobbit male names. The translated name is similar to historical names such as Chlodovic, in a manner comparable to how Meriadoc is similar to Celtic names such as Caradoc. (Arguably, a more Celtic-sounding form would have been even more appropriate in the translation, though it is less nativised than in the Czech translation.) The Slovak radio series used the Czech translation of Merry's name, but altered appropriately to fit Slovak grammar and pronunciation - ''Smiešok''. Merry is never referred to by his full name in the radio series, only by his nickname.\n\nFinally, possibly the greatest terminological difference occurs with the terms \"orc\" and \"orcs\". \n\nPošustová's Czech translations render orcs as ''skřeti'' (\"goblins\", \"dread-goblins\", singular ''skřet''), whereas Kořínek's Slovak translations use the term ''ohyzdi'' (derived from the words ''ohyzdnosť'' and ''ohyzdný'', \"foulness\" and \"foul-looking\", singular ''ohyzd'', with the \"o-\" initial as in \"orc\"). Viktor Krupa's older Slovak translation of the ''The Hobbit'' (1970s) and Kořínek's newer Slovak translation of ''The Hobbit'' both use ''škriatok'' and ''škriatkovia'' (\"goblin\" and \"goblins\") when referring to goblins (as the original novel also essentially never uses the term \"orc\"). The Czech translation and Slovak translation also altered the term [[Uruk-Hai|uruk-hai]], to ''skurut-hai'' and ''uhyz-hai''.<ref>Czech and Slovak are the only two European languages with translations of the Legendarium that also translate the term for orcs, rather than merely phonetize it.</ref>\n\nDue to the then-inavailability of Kořínek's Slovak translation, the radio series opted to adopt an invented term, ''skirt'' (pron. roughly \"skeert\" in English), derived from an altered form of the Czech translation's ''skrět''. The plural became, accordingly, ''skirti''. This is reflected even in the title of the first episode of the second series, ''Prenasledovanie skirtov'' (\"The Pursuit of the Skeerts\", i.e. \"The Pursuit of the Orcs\"). \n\nThe hobbits' family names are hardly ever referred to, possibly never. The Witch-king of Angmar never seems to be referred to by that title, and his position as the leader of the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]] is simply referred to as ''Pán nazgúlov'' (\"The Lord of the Nazgûl\"). Kořínek's Slovak book translation renders the epithet of the Witch-king as ''kráľ-strigôň'' (roughly \"king-warlock\", ''striga'' meaning \"witch\" (feminine grammatical gender only) and ''strigôň'' being the masculine grammatical gender equivalent).\n\nThough the Slovak radio series took great care to be as accurate as possible to the pronunciations of Tolkien's invented languages and names, a tiny handful are incorrect. The most prominent example of these very rare errors is referring to [[Cirith Ungol]] as \"Tsirith Ungol\" (a Slovak pronunciation of the letter ''c''), rather than the correct pronunciation of \"Kirith Ungol\" (with a \"hard ''c''\", e.g. as in the Welsh pronunciation of ''c'').\n\n==Other notes==\nA few of the actors who were part of the cast in the 1989 [[Hobit (1989 Slovak radio series)|Slovak ''Hobbit'' radio miniseries]] also appeared in the 2001-2003 Slovak radio adaptation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', albeit all in different roles. These actors include Boriš Farkaš, Ivan Gogál, Vlado Černý, Marián Zednikovič, Pavol Topoľský and Karol Čálik. \n\nSome of the actors from the Slovak ''The Lord of the Rings'' radio series also appeared in the Slovak television dubs of Peter Jackson's two film trilogies.\n\nJozef Vajda was the only one to reprise the same role, as Boromir. \n\nFor both the ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'' film trilogies, Marián Geišberg dubbed Bilbo Baggins, and Ivan Gogál dubbed Elrond. Boris Farkaš dubbed Gimli in ''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy and Radagast the Brown (in a different voice) in ''The Hobbit'' film trilogy. Leopold Haverl provided the voice of Gandalf in ''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy and Marián Slovák dubbed Gandalf in ''The Hobbit'' film trilogy. Slovák also voiced Saruman in ''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy and František Kovár voiced Saruman in ''The Hobbit'' film trilogy. Milan Bahúl appeared as Dwalin, Karol Čálik as Glóin, Ivan Laca as the Great Goblin, Matej Landl as Bert the troll and Jozef Švoňavský as the Master of Lake-town in the dub of ''The Hobbit'' film trilogy.<ref>[https://www.dabingforum.sk/viewtopic.php?f=122&t=85 ''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring''.
