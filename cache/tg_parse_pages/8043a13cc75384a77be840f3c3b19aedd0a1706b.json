It had many oars and many masts, upon which were sails of gold and sable.  \n\nIn this ship, he sailed to the shores of [[Aman]], leading the [[Great Armament]] to challenge the [[Valar]]. Alcarondas indeed reached the Undying Lands and anchored at shores of the Undying Lands and Ar-Pharazôn reached [[Tirion]], but this act only condemned him, his fleet and his kingdom.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n'''''Alcarondas''''', also written Alkarondas <ref>{{PM|Akallabeth}}, p.156</ref> means \"Castle of the Sea\" <ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> and is probably [[Adûnaic]].
