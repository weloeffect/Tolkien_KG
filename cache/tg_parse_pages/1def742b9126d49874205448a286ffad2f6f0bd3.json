Farin is a [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] champion of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]].<ref name=\"Backstory Farin\"/>\n\n==History==\n===Youth===\nFarin's family originally lived in [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. But after the attack of the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Smaug]] they went in exile to the [[Iron Hills]], where Farin was born. \n\nNews of the return of [[Thorin]] to Erebor reached the Iron Hills when Farin was still very young. Because there was a great need for soldiers, Farin marched in the army of [[Dáin Ironfoot]] to Erebor. There he fought in the [[Battle of the Five Armies]], where he proved to be a very strong warrior. For this reason, Dáin made him a member of his personal guard.<ref name=\"Backstory Farin\"/>\n\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings- War in the Nortgh - Farin (video game character).png|250px|thumb|Concept Art of '''Farin'''.]]\n\n===Life as Dáin's personal guard===\nAfter the battle Erebor was reclaimed by the Dwarves, and Dáin was crowned as [[King under the Mountain]]. Farin served him in [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], and fought together with the [[Bardings|men of Dale]] against the [[Orcs]] and [[Easterlings]]. Somewhere after {{TA|3001}} [[Bilbo Baggins]] visited Erebor to meet with his old friends. During this time Farin met Bilbo, and he was very impressed with him.\n\nWhen a messenger of [[Sauron]] came to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] in {{TA|3018}} and asked information about \"[[Baggins family|Baggins]]\" and  \"[[the Shire]]\", Farin was very worried. He thought that it was the task of his people to protect Bilbo Baggins and the Shire,  and therefore he did swore an oath that he would travel to that country and protect it. He searched for other companions, but none wanted to travel with him as Erebor was threatened by enemies. Therefore, he went alone after Dáin granted him permission to go.<ref name=\"Backstory Farin\"/>\n\n===War of the Ring===\nFarin arrived at the borders of the Shire and protected one of its access roads. He questioned travellers, and sent those who he didn't trust away. The [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]] heard of Farin, and [[Halbarad]] tried to resolve this mystery. Halbarad disguised himself as a traveller and gained Farin's confidence, who told him about his mission. As Halbarad was convinced that Farin's intentions were good, he asked him to join the Rangers in their guard.<ref name=\"Backstory Farin\"/>\n\n[[File:2011-12-23 00011.jpg|300px|thumb|left|[[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]], [[Andriel]] and '''Farin''' in [[Bree]].]]Farin joined the Rangers at [[Sarn Ford]], and became a friend of [[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]], [[Kilaran]] and [[Luin (video game character)|Luin]]. Just shortly before the [[Nazgûl]] attacked Sarn's Ford, he met [[Andriel]], who was surprised to see a Dwarf among the Rangers.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.warinthenorth.com/the-game/heroes/road-to-war/|articlename=Road to War|dated=|website=War in the North|accessed=3 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe next morning he assisted, together with Eradan and Andriel, the Rangers while they were attacked by the Nazgûl. They were defeated, and many of the Rangers were slain. However, shortly after the attack the [[Witch-king]] met with [[Agandaûr]]. Agandaûr tells the Witch-king that he had summoned the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] and assembled an army in [[Fornost]]. The Witch-king send him back to Fornost, to attack immediately.<ref name=\"Prologue\">[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], ''Prologue''</ref>\n\nHalbarad sent Eradan, Andriel and Farin to [[Bree]], to warn [[Aragorn]] about this news. The three companions meet him in [[Prancing Pony]], and tell him what happened at Sarn's Ford. Aragorn immediately sends them Fornost, to stop Agandaûr before he attacks.<ref name=\"Prologue\"/>\n\nIn [[Fornost]] Farin and his companions, Eradan and Andriel, find a chained [[Eagle]], captured by [[Orcs]] and [[Goblins]]. After killing his jailers, he introduces himself as [[Beleram]], one of the Eagles of the [[Misty Mountains]]. While gathering news for his lord - [[Gwaihir]] - he was taken out of the air by siege engines and sorcerers. Farin and his companions make a plan with Beleram to destroy the siege weapons, so Beleram can safely fly over Fornost.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Main Gate''</ref> \nOn the top of Fornost's battlements, Farin pushes two siege weapons from the battlements while [[Beleram]] attracts the attention of the [[Orcs]] and [[Goblins]]. The plan succeeds. Furthermore, they kill an Orc sorcerer and retrieve an unreadable scroll.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Battlements''</ref> \n\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings War in the North - Eradan, Andriel, Farin, Elladan and Elrohir.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Andriel]], [[Elladan]], [[Elrohir]], [[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]] and '''Farin''' at the gate of the Citadel.]] Further on, in the inner wards, Farin, Eradan and Andriel meet the sons of [[Elrond]], who were sent by their father to scout Fornost. Andriel, who was trained by them, introduces her companions to them and explains their mission. They team up to kill [[Agandaûr]].<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Outer Wards''</ref> Although separating, both groups (with the help of Beleram) eventually reach the citadel of Fornost.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Inner Wards''</ref> The citadel gate, however, is protected by [[Magic]], and [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]] need all their power and concentration to undo the magical protection. At the same time, a band of [[Orcs]] arrives which is successfully stopped by Farin and his companions.<ref name=\"tower\"/>\n\nInside the Citadel tower, the group overhears a conversation between Agandaûr and [[Tharzog]], the leader of the [[Orcs]] of [[Mount Gram]]. The latter informs Agandaûr that intruders have been spotted. Agandaûr commands the Orc to find and kill the intruders immediately, after which Agandaûr leaves. The group attempts to follow him, but is separated again when Tharzog notices them and closes the gates. Farin, Eradan and Andriel kill Tharzog and his guard.<ref name=\"tower\">[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Citadel Tower''</ref>\n\nOn the top of the Citadel tower they find Agandaûr fighting Elladan and Elrohir. Although he has the upper hand, he is not strong enough to fight Farin, Andriel, Eradan and the twins at the same time. He flees on the back of a [[Fell Beast]]. Although Beleram chases Agandaûr, the sorcerer summons a thunderstorm. After being hit by lightning, Beleram returns to the tower. They discuss the events concerning Agandaûr and Fornost, and decide to part: Beleram returns to [[Gwaihir]], the sons of Elrond return to their father in [[Rivendell]] and Farin and his companions travel to [[Sarn Ford]] to inform Halbarad.<ref name=\"tower\"/>\n\n==Family Tree==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |NOR| | | | NOR=[[Norin]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | |!| | | | }}\n{{familytree | | | | | |FAR| | | | | | | FAR='''Farin'''}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Skills==\n{{expansion}}\nHe uses an axe for melee combat and a crossbow for ranged combat.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.middleearthcenter.com/2010/09/war-in-the-north-gameplay-demo-at-pax/|articlename=War in the North Gameplay Trailer at PAX|dated=6 September 2010|website=Middle-earth Center|accessed=24 July 2011}}</ref> His strength lies in fighting enemies in close quarters.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://asia.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/the-lord-of-the-rings-war-in-the-north/news.html?sid=6296919&mode=previews|articlename=The Lord of the Rings: War in the North Q&A|dated=31 January 2011|website=Gamespot Asia|accessed=24 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Images of Farin (video game character)|Images of Farin]]\n*[[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]]\n*[[Andriel]]\n*[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]\n\n{{references}}\n{{title}}\n[[Category:Dwarves from adaptations]] [[Category:The Lord of the Rings: War in the North characters]]"}}}
