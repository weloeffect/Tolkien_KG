Tolkien]] allegedly wrote '''[[Letters not published in The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien|a letter]] to Dorothy'''.\n\n*'''Authenticity:''' \"...most likely genuine. If it isn't, it is a particularly well-informed and elaborate hoax\" - [[Carl F. Hostetter]].<ref name=\"Carl\">[https://tolkienlistsearch.herokuapp.com/message/5e9c35c32bd1e7b46e2ee689 message #6616] on [[Elfling]]</ref>\n*'''Publication:''' Only one [[Quenya]] sentence published in mailing lists.\n\n== Comment and Excerpt ==\nDorothy had sent [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] a letter asking him how to say \"Merry Christmas\" in [[Elvish]]; Tolkien replied that the [[Elves]] did not celebrate [[Christmas]] but they had a generic wish: ''[[mer-|Meri[n]]] [[sa]] [[harya-|harya]]lye [[alasse]]'' \"I hope that you have happiness\" (adding in a case of a mortal: ''[[nó]] [[vanya-|vanya]]lye [[Ambar]]ello'' \"before you pass from the world\").\n\n==Legacy==\nIn a letter dated [[14 October|October 14]] [[1968]] Dorothy mentioned Tolkien's letter and the Elvish phrase to a Ms Dawson with whom they shared love for Tolkien's work. In her letter, she transcribed the first word as ''Meriu''.\n\nOn [[1 April|April 1]] [[1999]], Dawson's son, Michael sent a mail to the [[Tolkien Mailing List]] inquiring the identity of his mother's friend. He asked whether such a letter by Tolkien has been published in [[Humphrey Carpenter]]'s \"''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]''\" so that he would identify and trace that Dorothy. Nobody could help Michael Dawson identify Dorothy, since the letter had never been published.\n===Significance and authenticity===\nLinguists of [[Tolklang]] and [[Elfling]] considered the Elvish sentence another piece of the Quenya puzzle; most importantly, the previously unknown words ''sa'' \"that\" (introducing a secondary sentence) and ''nó'' \"before\". They also corrected the first word ''meriu'' as a misread ''merin'': u and n tended to look identical in Tolkien's handwriting,<ref>{{webcite|website=Arda|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/errors.htm|articlename=Probable Errors in the Etymologies}}: \"''The letter '''n''' is involved in very many of the probable misreadings, [...] being misinterpreted (as [...] '''u''')''\"</ref> and the word was supposed to be a verb in [[Quenya#Pronouns|1st person singular]].\n\nThe Quenya sentence, known as \"Merin Sentence\", has been critically analyzed in publications such as [[Tyalië Tyelelliéva 14|''Tyalië Tyelelliéva'' 14]] by [[Lisa Star]].\n\nSome of the oddities concerning the phrase were that Michael Dawson sent his mail on April 1 ([[Wikipedia:Fool's Day|Fool's Day]]), and afterwards nobody could contact him.<ref name=\"Helge\">[http://www.uib.no/People/hnohf/less-d.rtf Quenya Lesson 20]</ref> [[Carl F. Hostetter]] and [[Christopher Tolkien]] (who was forwarded Dawson's mail by Hostetter) said that they had not encountered these 'new' words as such in any of Tolkien's unpublished papers.<ref name=\"Carl\"/>\n\nIt is of note that the vocabulary of the sentence fits ''[[The Etymologies]]'' suggesting that the letter to Dorothy was not written later than ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name=\"Helge\"/> In later publications, the word ''sa'' has been seen again in a text as \"that\"<ref>{{VT|49}} p.18</ref> but the word ''nó'' was given as \"but\".<ref>{{VT|41}}</ref>\n==See also==\n*[[Letters to Dorothy Wood]]\n*[[Letter to Jonathan Hepworth]] (a [[1963]] letter where Tolkien mentions another elvish wish for \"Merry Christmas\")\n{{references}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://tolklang.quettar.org/messages/Vol34/34.99 An excerpt of Michael Dawson's mail] forwarded to [[Tolklang]] mailing list.\n*[http://tolklang.quettar.org/messages/Vol35/35.02 Analysis] of the Quenya sentence by [[Helge Fauskanger]]\n*[http://groups.yahoo.com/group/elfling/message/569 Analysis] by [[David Salo]] on [[Elfling]] mailing list\n*[http://www.elvish.org/elm/merin.html Info on the \"merin sentence\"]\n[[Category:Letters|Dorothy]]\n[[Category:Internet]]"}}}
