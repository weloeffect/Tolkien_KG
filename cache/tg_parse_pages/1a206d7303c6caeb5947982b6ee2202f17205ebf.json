As a consequence, their language was related to [[Adûnaic]].<ref>{{App|Men}}, p. 1129</ref> \n\nAt the end of the First Age some of those Men had settled in the northern and eastern borders of Greenwood.<ref>{{PM|Atani}}, first paragraph</ref> Some migrated from the east of the Greenwood along its southern edge and up the vales of the river [[Anduin]] or between its northern edge and the [[Grey Mountains]]. During the [[First Age|First]] and [[Second Age]] the Northmen, such as the ancestors of the Woodmen, had been allies of the [[Longbeards]] and the [[Dwarves]] of the hills surrounding the Greenwood, and were enemies of the [[Orcs]] and [[Easterlings]].<ref>{{PM|Relations}}, third, fourth and seventh paragraph</ref> The Woodmen maintained friendly relations with the [[Elves of Mirkwood|Elves of the Greenwood]].<ref name=\"UT\">{{UT|Gladden}}, ''The sources of the legend of Isildur's death'', first paragraph</ref>\n\n==History==\nOn [[4 October]]<ref>{{UT|7a}}, note 9, Isildur started his journey on 5 September and was killed on the thirtieth of his journey</ref><ref>{{UT|Gladden}}, sixth paragraph</ref> in {{TA|2}},<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2, p. 1085</ref> the Woodmen noticed the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields|disastrous battle]] between the [[Dúnedain]] and the [[Orcs]] at the [[Gladden Fields]]. They sent runners to [[Thranduil]] and assembled a force to ambush the Orcs in order to rescue the Dúnedain, but by the time they arrived at the site of the battle it was too late: [[Isildur]] and almost all his Guards had been killed. All the Woodmen could do was to drive away the surviving Orcs, before they could mutilate the bodies of the dead. It was probably those Woodmen who found the stunned [[Estelmo]] alive under his master [[Elendur (son of Isildur)|Elendur]]'s dead body.<ref name=\"UT\" />\n\nAround {{TA|1050}} a shadow fell on Greenwood and men began to call it Mirkwood.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1085, p. 1085</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|1636}} the [[Great Plague]] spread north from [[Gondor]],<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1634, p. 1086</ref> but it is not recorded how the Woodmen fared.\n\nThe [[Eagles]] used to feed on the Northmen's [[sheep]], who defended them with their [[bows]] of yew; thus they were afraid to fly anywhere near where men lived. The [[Wargs]] and the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] also usually did not dare to approach as they were brave and well-armed.<ref name=\"H6\">{{H|6}}</ref>\n\nAt the time of the [[Quest of Erebor]] in {{TA|2941}}<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2941, p. 1089</ref> the Woodmen settled in Mirkwood south of the [[Old Forest Road]] near the western edges of the forest.<ref>{{H|Wilderland}}</ref> Around this time some bold Woodmen and their families were attempting to make their way back to the north, cutting down trees, and building settlements among the woods in the valleys and along the river-shores. This time Orcs and Wargs started planning a joint raid against them to capture slaves. When the Orcs discovered [[Thorin and Company]], they thought they were spies of those Woodmen and hunted them down, fearing they would warn their people.<ref name=\"H6\" />\n\nObviously the raid never took place, thanks to the subsequent events, including the [[Battle of Five Armies]] where Orcs and Wargs were devastated. After the Battle, Men could travel without fear and many came to [[Beorn]]'s home to celebrate [[Yule]], and some gathered under him as a chieftain.<ref>{{H|18}}</ref>\n\nA couple of years later, [[Gollum]] traversed Mirkwood in search for [[One Ring|his Ring]] and [[Bilbo Baggins|its new bearer]]; this terrified the Woodmen who talked about \"a [[ghosts|ghost]] that drank blood\", that even crept into houses to steal babies.<ref>{{FR|Shadow}}, p. 58</ref>\n\nIt is possible that the Woodmen fought against forces of [[Sauron]] from [[Dol Guldur]] in Mirkwood during the [[War of the Ring]], because [[Frodo Baggins]] had a vision on the Seat of Seeing on [[Amon Hen]] of a fight of Elves and Men and fell beasts under the branches of Mirkwood<ref>{{FR|Breaking}}, p. 400</ref> and some of the Woodmen were living in the western edge of Mirkwood north of Dol Guldur and east of the Gladden Fields.\n\nAfter the cleansing of the forest, the Woodmen and the [[Beornings]] were given the central portion of [[Eryn Lasgalen]], between the [[Narrows of the Forest]] and the [[Woodland Realm]].<ref>{{App|Great}}, p. 1094</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nMessengers from the Woodmen of Mirkwood<ref>{{WR|3|II}}, p. 242</ref> came to [[Rohan]] after they had received a message that all who hate [[Mordor]] should come there<ref>{{WR|3|II}}, pp. 247, 249</ref> in three manuscript versions of what would later become the chapter ''[[The Muster of Rohan]]''.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''\n:[[Gandalf]] mentions at the meeting of the [[White Council]] that [[Greenwood the Great]] is now called \"[[Mirkwood]]\" by the Woodmen. In the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien men began to call it Mirkwood in T.A. 1050, almost 2000 years before this meeting of the White Council.\n\n'''2019: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Woodmen.jpg|thumb|Woodmen in ''The Lord of the Rings Online'']]\n:The Woodmen live in the Vales on both sides of the river [[Anduin]]. They are self-reliant and very isolated people, with even the nearby villages having very little contact with one another. Woodmen settlements include the larger town of Hultvís, the smaller villages of Blómgard and Arhaim, the recently-destroyed Waldfast and the long-abandoned Audaghaim. During the closing weeks of the [[War of the Ring]] the Woodmen were attacked by the [[Orcs]] and [[Wargs]] of the [[Misty Mountains]], but a united force of [[Beornings]] and Woodmen pushed back and eventually defeated them at the Battle of the [[Old Ford]].\n\n:The Woodmen are deeply superstitious due to the long years of living under the darkness of [[Mirkwood]], but many of their folk tales bear a seed of truth in them. For example, the real events of [[Gollum]] stealing Woodmen babies have been attributed to \"Úbil the Snatcher\", who over the years have transformed into the hunger-crazed \"Old Mad Ubb\" used to scare the children.\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Woodmen| ]]\n[[Category:Demonyms]]\n[[Category:Northmen]]"}}}
