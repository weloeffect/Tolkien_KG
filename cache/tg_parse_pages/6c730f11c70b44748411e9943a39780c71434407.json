He was lord there for millennia, and in that time his realm was protected from foes by the [[Girdle of Melian]] (after the return of [[Morgoth]]). Thingol was slain by the [[Dwarves]] in {{FA|503}}, and Melian departed from the realm. Thingol was succeeded by their grandson, the son of their daughter [[Lúthien]].
