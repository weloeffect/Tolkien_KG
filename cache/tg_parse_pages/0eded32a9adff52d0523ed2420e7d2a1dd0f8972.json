This scene was extended in the latter edition.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] lie motionless at night, seemingly asleep in [[Emyn Muil]], as [[Gollum]] creeps down a cliff-face towards them. He calls them thieves and says \"they stole [[The One Ring|it]] from us!\" As he nears them, the two hobbits spring up and grab him. He fights back viciously until Frodo draws [[Sting]] and holds it to Gollum's throat, causing him to stop fighting the hobbits. \n\nThe scene transitions to day, where Frodo and Sam are leading Gollum by the [[Elven rope]] they have attached around his neck. He screams in pain, saying that burns and that \"nasty [[Elves]] twisted it\", and begs them to take it off him; he swears on the Ring \"to serve the master of the precious\". Sam does not believe him, but Frodo accepts this, takes the rope off Gollum's neck, and tells him to lead them to the [[Black Gate]]. \n\nGollum races off through the Emyn Muil, arguing with himself about going back to Mordor. Just as Sam believes he has run off, Gollum reappears to the two hobbits and tells them to follow him. \n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers scenes|03]]"}}}
