The young man was successful in finding the village and creeping so close to one of its watchmen's huts that he could hear their conversation. However, he was unable to comprehend their words although their tone suggested fear and mourning.<ref>{{PM|Elmar}}</ref>\n\nWhat Tal-Elmar did not know was that the people of Udul, known as the Udul-folk, were dying from a pestilence and that the marauders who had come to Agar were desperately seeking food.<ref>{{PM|Elmar}}, note 12</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Cities, towns and villages]]\n[[Category:Mannish words]]\n[[Category:Regions]]\n[[de:Udul]]\n[[fi:Udul]]"}}}
