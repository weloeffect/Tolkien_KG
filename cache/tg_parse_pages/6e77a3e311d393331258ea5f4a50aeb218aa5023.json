It did not come naturally to me. And then, in my mid-20s, I was like, ‘Oh, I’m gonna go act now,’ and, needless to say, my parents were like, ‘Wait, what? You can’t just throw away medicine!’ And so I just started taking as many classes as I could. I didn’t go to drama school at the time. I think my advice would be to my younger self, it’s okay to make mistakes on screen and learn from it, because I had, as a lot of actors do, imposter syndrome, right? ‘I’m supposed to be a doctor. I’m not supposed to be doing this.’ So I think, it’s okay. Cut yourself some slack and it’s okay to learn as you go, and improve and grow.|Nazanin Boniadi, Collider}}\n{{quote|I truly felt exhilarated playing Bronwyn.|Nazanin Boniadi, TheWrap}}\n\n{{references}}\n==External links==\n* {{WP|Nazanin Boniadi}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Boniadi, Nazanin}}\n[[Category:Actors and actresses]]\n[[Category:British people]]\n[[Category:People by name]]\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) cast]]"}}}
