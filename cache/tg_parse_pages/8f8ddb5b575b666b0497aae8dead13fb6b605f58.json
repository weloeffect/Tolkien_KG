During the [[War of the Ring]], a riot broke out in the Tower with a rival band of orcs from [[Minas Morgul]]. Lagduf attempted to escape with another Orc named [[Muzgash]], but they were both shot as they ran from the fortress.<ref>{{RK|VI1}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nThe earlier form of this character's name used by [[Tolkien]] was ''Laghorn''.<ref>{{SD|II}}, p. 26. Cf. also Index</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'''''\n: Though unidentified, a trio of Uruk-hai are encountered by Samwise Gamgee on the stairs of the tower after the battle. Since only one Uruk ([[Snaga (Orc of Mordor)|Snaga]]) was encountered by Sam on the stairs in the novel, it is likely that the other two are meant to be Lagduf and [[Muzgash]].\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Black Speech words]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:Orcs]]\n[[Category:Servants of Sauron]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]"}}}
