he was not merry and spoke little, though he learned to speak early and ever seemed older than his years. Túrin was slow to forget injustice or mockery, but his father's fire was also in him, and he could be sudden and fierce. Yet he was quick to pity, and the hurts or sadness of living things might move him to tears.|''[[The Children of Húrin]]'', \"[[The Childhood of Túrin]]\"}}</center>\n\n'''Túrin Turambar''' was a tragic hero of the [[First Age]] whose life was dominated by the curse of the [[Morgoth|Enemy]]. His deeds became the tale called ''[[Narn i Chîn Húrin (tale)|Narn i Chîn Húrin]]'' (\"The Tale of the Children of Húrin\"). \n\n==History==\n[[Image:Alan Lee - The Childhood of Túrin.jpg|thumb|left|''The Childhood of Túrin'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]\n===Dor Lómin===\nTúrin was the only son of [[Húrin|Húrin Thalion]] and [[Morwen|Morwen Eledhwen]]. He had a younger sister [[Urwen]] whom everyone called ''Lalaith'', but she died in childhood from the [[Evil Breath]], the first grievous event in Túrin's life. After Húrin was captured in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] (\"Battle of Unnumbered Tears\"), Túrin remained with his mother Morwen, who hid him from the [[Easterlings]] that [[Morgoth]] had sent to [[Hithlum]], fearing they would kill Túrin or enslave him.\n\nTúrin was friends with [[Sador]], their household servant whom he helped in his work. Sador taught him many things and carved several things for him from wood.<ref>{{CH|1}}, p. 41</ref>\n\n===Doriath===\nWhen Túrin was nine years old, Morwen sent him to [[Doriath]], away from his beloved mother and best friend, causing his heart to break for the third time since the curse was cast on him. She sent with him [[Gethron]] and [[Grithnir]], long-time servants, to Húrin's house. Shortly after they departed from Dor-Lómin, Túrin's second sister, [[Nienor]], was born. The road there was long and difficult, and the three travelers came close to dying of hunger and cold in the very outlying woods of their destination, but they were rescued by [[Beleg]]. In Doriath he was adopted by King [[Thingol]] as a son, being that his father Húrin was held in high honor in those lands. Thingol and Melian sent messengers inviting Túrin's mother to come to live in Doriath, which she declined, much to Túrin's grief.<ref>{{CH|4}}</ref>\n[[File:Anke Eißmann - Túrin begs leave of Thingol and Melian.jpg|150px|left|thumb|''Túrin begs leave of Thingol and Melian'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]\nIn Doriath, Túrin learned many skills, such as hunting, woodcraft, archery, sword fighting, and speaking [[Sindarin]]. As he grew older, however, he became restless. He began inquiring about the Men of the North, as Thingol and Morwen frequently exchanged news for Túrin's sake. Through these messages, he learned of his younger sister Nienor, although he never saw her. As Morgoth's hold on the North increased, and news from Hithlum grew scarce, Túrin sought to travel there to join the fight against the Dark Lord and find out about his kin. He asked the King's permission to join [[Beleg|Beleg Cúthalion]] in the northern marches of Doriath, fighting the [[Orcs]] of Morgoth. He wore the [[Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin]], which was sent by his mother and brought to him by Thingol's messengers, and the Orcs began to fear him more than any other.<ref name=\"Doriath\">{{CH|5}}</ref>\n\nUpon returning, Túrin accidentally caused the death of [[Saeros]], one of Thingol's counselors who had provoked and attacked him. Before he could be either punished or forgiven, he fled,<ref name=\"Doriath\" /> eventually meeting up with a band of outlaws, the [[Gaurwaith]] who dwelt south of the [[Forest of Brethil]]. There he was only known by the epithet '''''Neithan''''' (\"The Wronged\"). Túrin killed their leader [[Forweg]] and became their leader in his place. During his rule, he stopped the outlaws from raiding houses of Men, and only hunted Orcs.<ref name=\"Outlaws\">{{CH|6}}</ref>\n\n===Dor-Cúarthol===\nIn the meantime, Beleg Cúthalion obtained leave from Thingol to seek out his friend.<ref>{{CH|5}}, p. 96</ref> Beleg found Túrin's outlaws at their camp, and when he could not persuade his friend to leave the outlaws, he left to return to Doriath.<ref name=\"Outlaws\" /> While they were parted, and after such a long time living in the wild, Túrin's band captured [[Mîm]] the [[Petty-dwarves|Petty-dwarf]]. Mîm was forced to share his [[House of Ransom|halls]] on [[Amon Rûdh]] with them.<ref>{{CH|7}}</ref> \n[[File:Elena Kukanova - Strongbow and Dragonhelm.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Strongbow and Dragonhelm'' by [[Elena Kukanova]]]]\nAt Doriath, Beleg asked to be able to join his friend. Thingol allowed this and also gave him the black sword [[Anglachel]], and [[Melian]] gave him ''[[lembas]]''. Beleg returned to Túrin that winter, healing those of the band that had become sick with cold. Beleg brought with him the Dragon-helm, and the area around Amon Rûdh became known as '''[[Dor-Cúarthol]]''', the \"Land of Bow and Helm\" (since Beleg was known as a mighty bowman). Túrin took the name '''''Gorthol''''', \"The Dread Helm\". Many warriors joined them, and much of [[West Beleriand]] was freed from evil for a while.\n\nEventually, Túrin was betrayed by Mîm, and he was captured and all his men slain.<ref>{{CH|8}}</ref> Beleg survived and rescued Túrin from the Orcs in [[Taur-nu-Fuin (Dorthonion)|Taur-nu-Fuin]] with the help of [[Gwindor]], an escaped slave of Morgoth, but Túrin accidentally killed Beleg with Beleg's sword Anglachel. Gwindor led Túrin, dazed, to the [[Pools of Ivrin]], where he came back to his senses.<ref>{{CH|9}}</ref>\n\n===Nargothrond===\nGwindor then led Túrin to [[Nargothrond]], where once he had lived. In Nargothrond Túrin hid his name, calling himself '''''[[Agarwaen]], son of [[Úmarth]]''''' (\"Bloodstained, son of Ill-fate\"). He had Anglachel reforged and named it [[Gurthang]] (\"Iron of Death\"). [[Finduilas]], daughter of [[Orodreth]], fell in love with him, but he avoided her because she had previously been the beloved of his friend Gwindor. Túrin declined to tell her his name, so she called him '''''Thurin''''' (\"The Secret\"). He was also called '''''Adanedhel''''' (\"Man-Elf\") because he was so like an Elf, though he was a [[Men|Man]].<ref>{{CH|10}}</ref> \n\nHis identity did not remain hidden for long. Gwindor revealed to [[Finduilas]] that 'Agarwaen' was in fact Túrin, and 'Úmarth' his famous father [[Húrin]]. Whether the news is reached Finduilas' father, King [[Orodreth]], Túrin was given great honor and standing. Túrin believed revealing his identity thus would also bring home Morgoth's curse. <ref group=\"note\">[[Christopher Tolkien]] makes clear that this was not the case. Cf. {{CH|Introduction}}, p. 18.</ref>\n[[File:Donato Giancola - Sack of Nargothrond.jpeg|thumb|200px|''Sack of Nargothrond'' by [[Donato Giancola]]]]\nTúrin became a chief counselor of the weak Orodreth and was highly influential in Nargothrond. He encouraged the [[Elves of Nargothrond]] to abandon their practice of secrecy, and they built a great bridge before the gates. Because of his prowess with Gurthang, he became known as '''''Mormegil''''' (\"Black Sword\").\nMorgoth sent the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Glaurung]] to Nargothrond. Túrin was caught by the powerful gaze of Glaurung and stood by idly as Finduilas was dragged away, calling to him, a captive for Morgoth. Glaurung deceived him into believing Morwen and Nienor were suffering in Dor-lómin, and Túrin abandoned Finduilas to seek out his kin. In actuality, Morwen and Nienor were safely in Doriath, as Túrin's efforts had made the way passable.\n\nOnce in Dor-lómin, Túrin found his old home empty. He went to the wooden halls of the Easterling lord [[Brodda]], who had taken Húrin's kinswoman [[Aerin]] as a wife and had taken Húrin's lands and possessions. From Aerin, Túrin learned that Morwen had left, and in his rage he killed Brodda, thereby sealing Aerin's fate. As an unintended consequence of Túrin’s problematic heroism, Aerin immolated herself alive in her halls, and the remainder of the [[House of Hador]] were persecuted by the Easterlings even more cruelly than before.\n\nTúrin next tried to find Finduilas, but by the time he picked up the Orc's trail he came too late: the woodsmen of [[Brethil]] informed him she had been killed as they had tried to rescue the prisoners of Nargothrond. Túrin collapsed on the mound she was buried in, and was brought to Brethil.\n\n===Brethil===\nIn Brethil, Túrin again took up his life, now calling himself '''''Turambar''''' (\"Master of Fate\") in the act of bravado, deciding that his curse was now finally over. One day he found a naked young woman on [[Haudh-en-Elleth]], and calling her ''[[Níniel]],'' he later took her as his wife.\n\nTúrin's happiness ended when Glaurung came near Brethil. Túrin, with two others, set out to kill the dragon, but he was the only one to reach the drake. With his black sword, he killed Glaurung at [[Cabed-en-Aras]] but was hurt and fell in a swoon. As Níniel came to search for him, Glaurung with his last word, revealed to her she was Túrin's sister. Horrified, Níniel killed herself.\n\n[[File:John Howe - Dragon's Curse.jpg|thumb|200px|''Dragon's Curse'' by [[John Howe]]]]\nWhen Túrin awoke he was told by [[Brandir]], lord of the [[Haladin]] of Brethil what had happened, and he killed Brandir, refusing to believe. When he learned from [[Mablung]] of Doriath who had come to seek him that Brandir had told the truth, he killed himself on [[Gurthang]], his black sword. \n\nTúrin was buried near Finduilas' grave, and on his tombstone, the Haladin wrote in the [[Angerthas Daeron|Cirth of Doriath]]:\n\n<blockquote>TÚRIN TURAMBAR DAGNIR GLAURUNGA<br>(''Túrin, Conqueror of Fate, Slayer of Glaurung'')</blockquote>\n\nBeneath that they also wrote:\n\n<blockquote>NIENOR NÍNIEL</blockquote>\n\nthough her body could not be found.\n\n==Legacy==\nTwo years later, Morwen and Húrin came separately to Túrin's grave and met for the last time. Morwen passed away that night and Húrin buried her near their son, inscribing her epitaph on the same [[Stone of the Hapless|stone]]. The burial mound survived the [[War of Wrath]] and sinking of Beleriand to become [[Tol Morwen]], the westernmost isle off the coast of [[Lindon]] in the [[Second Age|Second]] and [[Third Age]]s.<ref>{{S|22}}</ref>\n\nTúrin was a first cousin of [[Tuor]], father of [[Eärendil]]. There are many parallels between the circumstances of their lives (both lost their fathers in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, were raised in part by Elves, spent time as outlaws and as prisoners, and were war-leaders in the greatest [[Noldor]]in fortresses), but the outcome of Tuor's life was quite different. (Even Túrin's coloring was dark, enhancing his resemblance to the Noldorin Elves but further setting him apart from his fair-haired cousin.) The two never actually met, but Tuor did once see his cousin in passing on his way to Gondolin (not an everyday occurrence in the wilds of [[Beleriand]]).\n\nThere were several prophecies that Túrin would return from death. The [[Wise-woman]] [[Andreth]] of the [[Edain]] prophesied that Túrin \"in the Last Battle should return from the Dead, and before he left the [[Circles of the World]] for ever should challenge the Great Dragon of Morgoth, [[Ancalagon]] the Black, and deal him the death-stroke.\"<ref name=\"Rosnotes\">{{PM|Rosnotes}}, ''Note 17'', p. 374</ref><ref group=\"note\">According to Christopher Tolkien, Andreth predicted the [[War of Wrath]] at the end of the age in this prophecy making unclear whether it was [[Eärendil]] or Túrin who killed Ancalagon in the War of Wrath.</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[Second Prophecy of Mandos]], at the end of time Morgoth will return to [[Valinor]] to wage a final battle against the Valar and Túrin will return to \"deal unto Morgoth his death and final end.\"<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, p. 333</ref> \n\n\n\n\nWhether the tragedies in Túrin's life were the result of Morgoth's curse, his own arrogance, or some combination of the two is debatable. Túrin is one of the few heroes of the [[Elder Days]] to have committed suicide and several of the others (such as [[Aerin]], Húrin and Nienor) are connected with his story.\n\n==Etymology==\n:''See: [[Túrin (disambiguation)]] and [[Turambar (disambiguation)]]''\n\nIn [[The Etymologies]] Túrin was given as a compound of [[Noldorin|N.]] ''tûr '''victory' and ''ind'' 'heart'.<ref name=\":0\" /> The [[Quenya]] form of his name was given as ''Turindo''.<ref name=\":0\">{{LR|P3}}, entry \"[[TUR]]\"</ref> \n\nIn [[Parma Eldalamberon 22|Late Notes on  Verb Structure]], written around [[1969]], Tolkien stated that the [[Quenya]] word ''turindo'' meant 'purposeful mind' or 'strong-will', and that as a name its form was ''Túrin.''<ref>{{PE|22c}}, p. 165</ref>\n\n==Other names==\nTúrin took and was given many names through his life, listed here in chronological order:\n\n*'''Woodwose''' or '''Wildman of the Woods''', first given by Saeros as an insult, Túrin used it when questioned about his identity by the woodsmen he had rescued.<ref>{{CH|13}}, p. 194</ref>\n*'''''[[Neithan]]''''', ([[S.]] \"The Wronged\"), taken by Túrin when he joined the outlaws.<ref>{{CH|6}}, p. 101</ref>\n*'''''Gorthol''''', ([[S.]] \"The Dread Helm\"), taken by Túrin when he claimed lordship of Dor-Cúarthol in reference to the Dragon-helm of Dor-lómin.<ref>{{CH|8}}, p. 146</ref>\n*'''''Agarwaen''''', ''son of [[Úmarth]]'', ([[S.]] \"Bloodstained, son of Ill-fate\"), the names Túrin gave himself and his father while in Nargothrond in an attempt to hide his identity as a child of Húrin.<ref>{{CH|10}}, p. 159</ref>\n*'''''Adanedhel''''', ([[S.]] \"Elf-Man\"), given to him by the Elves of Nargothrond, who recognized the nobility he had acquired while in Doriath.<ref>{{CH|10}}, pp. 163-164</ref>\n*'''''[[Thurin]]''''', ([[S.]] \"The Secret\"), given to him by Finduilas, who doubted that his true name was ''Agarwaen''.<ref>{{CH|10}}, p. 165</ref>\n*'''''Mormegil''''', ([[S.]] \"Black Sword\"), acquired by Túrin while he dwelt in Nargothrond, in reference to his black sword, [[Gurthang]].<ref>{{CH|10}}, p. 160</ref>\n*'''''Turambar''''', ([[Q.]] \"Master of Doom\"), taken by Túrin when he lived among the Men of Brethil, signifying his perceived freedom from the curse of Morgoth.<ref>{{CH|13}}, p. 196</ref>\n*'''''Dagnir Glaurunga''''',  ([[S.]] \"Glaurung's Bane\"), given after he killed Glaurung and carved with [[Angerthas Daeron|Runes of Doriath]] on the [[Stone of the Hapless]].<ref>{{CH|18}}, p. 257</ref>\n*'''''Naeramarth''''', ([[S.]] \"Evilfated\"), given within Tolkien's genealogical tree of the [[Half-elven]] kinship.<ref>[[Kinship of the Half-elven]], main image</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | BRE | | | | HAL | | HAD | BRE=[[Bregolas]]|HAL=[[Halmir]]|HAD=[[Hador|Hador Lórindol]]}}\n{{familytree | |,|-|^|-|.| | | |!| | | |!|}}\n{{familytree | BEL | | BAR | | HAR |y| GAL | BEL=[[Belegund]]|BAR=[[Baragund]]|GAL=[[Galdor (Lord of Dor-lómin)|Galdor of Dor-lómin]]|HAR=[[Hareth]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |!| | | |,|-|^|-|.|}}\n{{familytree | | | | | MOR |y| HUR | | HUO | | |MOR=[[Morwen|Morwen Eledhwen]]|HUR=[[Húrin|Húrin Thalion]]|HUO=[[Huor]]}}\n{{familytree | | | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|.| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | TUR | | LAL | | NIE | | | | TUR='''TÚRIN TURAMBAR'''|LAL=[[Lalaith]]|NIE=[[Nienor]]}}\n{{familytree | | | |L|~|~|~|~|~|~|~|J| | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n{{expansion}}\nThe broad strokes of the story of Túrin in the legendarium originates in Tolkien's attempted [[The Story of Kullervo|retelling]] of Kullervo's tale from [[Elias Lönnrot]]'s [[Kalevala]].<ref>''[[The Story of Kullervo]]''</ref>\n\nIn an early linguistic text, the [[Gnomes]] of Nargothrond gave Túrin the name '''''Gormagli''''', which is [[Noldorin]] for \"Great Bear\". Its cognate in [[Qenya]] is '''''Oromatsilë'''''.<ref>{{PE|13}}</ref>{{rp|149}}\n\n==Inspiration==\nUnpublished drafts of the story, later edited by [[Christopher Tolkien]] and published in  ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' and ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' series, tell the story in greater detail. These have been carefully edited together with other drafts to form ''[[The Children of Húrin]]'', released in 2007.\n\nThe supposed resemblance of Túrin to figures from medieval tales can be confirmed by part of a letter Tolkien wrote to [[Milton Waldman]] concerning the publication of his works:\n\n{{blockquote|There is the ''Children of Húrin'', the tragic tale of Túrin Turambar and his sister Níniel — of which Túrin is the hero: a figure that might be said (by people who like that sort of thing, though it is not very useful) to be '''derived from elements in Sigurd the Volsung, Oedipus, and the Finnish Kullervo'''.|[[Letter 131]]}}\n\n{{blockquote|Again one may detect certain literary influences: the hero's [Túrin's] fight with a great dragon [Glaurung] inevitably suggests comparison with the deeds of '''Sigurd''' and '''Beowulf''', while his unknowing incest with his sister and his subsequent suicide were derived quite consciously from the story of '''Kullervo in the Kalevala'''.|''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]'', Part III, Chapter 1: \"Lost Tales\"}}\n\nTúrin shares several common traits with all of the characters below, like coming closer to their fate when attempting to evade it. Another significant trait is their gifted but hot tempered nature and strong will paired with their reluctance to heed wise counsels that would save them from their fate.\n\n===Oedipus===\n'''[[Wikipedia:Oedipus|Oedipus]]''' was a prince of Thebes, but his parents heard a prophecy that he would cause their demise. To evade it, they order a shepherd to kill him. However the shepherd spares the baby and gives him to a childless family. Oedipus grew ignorant of his heritage; he then heard a prophecy according to which he will kill his father and marry his mother. He left in self-exile to take himself away from his (foster) parents. \n\nHowever this brought himself closer to Thebes and his actual parents. On his way, he kills a man who unknown to him, is his actual father, the King of Thebes, fulfilling therefore part of the prophecy. Then he enters the city and after defeating the Sphinx, the people name him to replace the lost King of Thebes; furthermore, Oedipus marries the King's widow, who is in fact his mother.\n\nYears later, while investigating the death of the former King, he realizes all the truths in his life: the King was the very man he had killed, and furthermore, he and his Queen were his parents. Oedipus blinds himself and leaves in self-exile with his two daughters/half-sisters while his mother/wife strangles herself.\n\n===Kullervo===\n{{Seealso|Kalevala#Túrin Turambar and Kullervo|l1=Túrin Turambar and Kullervo}}\nIn the [[Kalevala]], '''[[Wikipedia:Kullervo|Kullervo]]''''s tribe is killed by his uncle, and himself is separated by his family, something that fills him with hate and desire for revenge. As a slave, he uses magic to kill his masters and returns to his tribe; afterwards he seduces a girl, who commits suicide after discovering she is his lost sister.\n\nThen he repeats his vows: he refuses to hear any words of reconsideration and gets a broadsword which he uses to slay the enemy tribe. On his return, he sees all his family dead. He asks the magic sword to slay him, which replies, and then he falls on it.\n\n===Sigurd===\n'''[[Wikipedia:Sigurd|Sigurd]]''''s mother marries a King and Sigurd himself is fostered by a Dwarf. The Dwarf tells him about the hoard of the dragon Fafnir (who is his brother) and remakes a broken heirloom sword for him. Sigurd slays Fafnir by waiting for him in a pit, stabbing him with the sword as he passes over it. The gold he wins, however, is cursed.\n\n===Balin===\n'''[[Wikipedia:Sir Balin|Sir Balin]]''' was a knight of the King Arthur's court in ''Le Morte d'Arthur'' who possessed a magic sword. By this he was unknowingly cursed to slay his own brother. Through a well-meaning act of his, he is further cursed to make the most dolorous strike ever made by man, save only the piercing of Christ's side. Later, while in King Pellam's castle, he kills Pellam's brother and maims Pellam, ruining the castle and making all the surrounding lands into a wasteland, much as Túrin slayed Brodda in his own house and how his pride brought about the destruction of Nargothrond. Eventually, he kills his brother Balan, but is mortally wounded in doing so, and outlives him by only a few hours. They were then both laid in one grave.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[The Children of Húrin]]''\n*''[[The Story of Kullervo]]''\n*''[[The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun]]''\n\n{{References|Notes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Turin}}\n{{gaurwaith}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Children of Húrin]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Gnomish names]]\n[[Category:House of Hador]]\n[[Category:Noldorin names]]\n[[Category:Rulers in the Great Lands]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n[[de:Túrin]]\n[[fi:Túrin]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/hommes/1a/peuple de hador/turin]]"}}}
