This magnificent map will take you to the First Age of Middle-earth, many thousands of years before the events chronicled in The Lord of the Rings. This was the setting for the great War of the Jewels, as recounted in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Silmarillion.<br><br>\n\nThe Map of Beleriand and the Lands to the North is faithfully reproduced in full colour by John Howe, based on the original map by Christopher Tolkien. Embellished with heraldic emblems and dramatic scenes from The Silmarillion, it completes the trio of authorized Tolkien maps by John Howe. The map is accompanied by an illustrated booklet by Tolkien expert and playwright Brian Sibley which details the background to The Silmarillion and includes a gazetteer of the many places shown on the map.}}\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[West of the Mountains, East of the Sea]]''\n\n{{title|italics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Map of Tolkien's Middle-earth, The}}\n[[Category:Map books]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
