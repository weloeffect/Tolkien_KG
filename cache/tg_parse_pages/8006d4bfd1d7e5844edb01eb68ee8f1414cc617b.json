Baranor was invented by [[Electronic Arts]] for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]''. Although he doesn't make an actual appearance in the game, he is mentioned in [http://www.warinthenorth.com/the-game/heroes/backstory#dunedainAnchor Eradan's History].<ref name=\"Backstory Eradan\">{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.warinthenorth.com/the-game/heroes/backstory#dunedainAnchor|articlename=Human Character: Eradan's History|dated=|website=War in the North|accessed=25 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nBaranor is a descendant of a noble family from [[Númenor]], who were loyal to [[Elendil]]. When the [[Valar]] destroyed Númenor, they went into exile to [[Middle-earth]]. They lived in [[Arnor]], where they served the [[Kings of Arnor]] and, after the fall of Arnor, the [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain]].\n\nBaranor lived in the [[Angle]], where he served as a [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]], and had one son, Eradan. In the time of [[Aragorn]] he was lost while patrolling the [[Misty Mountains]]. Afterwards his son was fostered by his brother, Dunhir.<ref name=\"Backstory Eradan\"/>\n\n==Family Tree==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |NUM| | | | NUM=[[Númenóreans]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | |:| | | | }}\n{{familytree | | | |,|-|-|^|-|-|.| | | }}\n{{familytree | | |BAR| | | |DUN| BAR='''Baranor'''|DUN=[[Dunhir]]}}\n{{familytree | | | |!| | | | | | | | | }}\n{{familytree | | |ERA| | | | | ERA=[[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]]}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n{{References}}\n{{title}}\n[[Category:Men from adaptations]] [[Category:The Lord of the Rings: War in the North characters]]"}}}
