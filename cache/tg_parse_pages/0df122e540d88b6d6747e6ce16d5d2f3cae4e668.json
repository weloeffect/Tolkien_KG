[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] was aware of this legend and made references to it.\n\nThe concept of [[Aman]] as the Paradise in the West, and the voyage of [[Ælfwine]], are inspired from the tale of St. Brendan. Tolkien even wrote a poem ''[[Imram]]'' about him.\n\nBrendan's voyage is referenced again in ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]'' as well as the search for the West.\n\n==External links==\n*{{WP|Brendan the Navigator}}\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoidKafqU88 The Tomb of St Brendan the Navigator], video by Irish Dominicans\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brendan}}\n[[Category:Christianity]]\n[[Category:Irish people]]\n[[Category:The Notion Club Papers]]\n[[Category:People by name]]\n[[Category:Religious workers]]"}}}
