The song name is taken from [[Taur-nu-Fuin (disambiguation)|Taur-nu-Fuin]], the name given to the forest of [[Dorthonion]] after it fell into darkness in the [[First Age]], and the dark forest of [[Mirkwood]] in the [[Third Age]]. Like the song [[Lugburz (song)|Lugburz]] from the album [[Minas Morgul (album)|Minas Morgul]], the lyrics directly reference the [[Cold be hand and heart and bone,|incantation]] chanted by a [[Barrow-wights|Barrow-wight]] who had trapped [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] in the [[Fog on the Barrow-downs]] chapter of [[The Fellowship of the Ring]].\n\n==Lyrics==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nAnd in the glade a light was seen \nOf stars and shadows shimmering \nImmortal maiden elven-wise... \nLong was the way through iron halls and darkling doors \n\nAnd woods of nightshade morrowless \nElven-wise dance with me... \nCold be hand, heart and bone \nAnd cold be my sleep under stone \nNever more I'll wake on a snowy bed \nNever - 'til the sun fails and the moon is dead \n\nIn the black winds the stars shall die \nAnd still on gold here let them lie \n'Til the dark lord lifts his hand \nOver dead seas and withered land \n\nAnd I'll fly away... \nWhere I dwell none can say \nFor into darkness fell my star \nIn Mordor where the shadows are\n</poem>\n\n[[Category:Songs by Summoning]]"}}}
