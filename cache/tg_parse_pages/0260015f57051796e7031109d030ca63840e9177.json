Though he initially took a liking to Túrin, the arrival of the [[Elf]] [[Beleg]] aroused his hatred and jealousy and he betrayed them to the [[Orc]]s of [[Morgoth]].\n\nMîm eventually made his way back to Nargothrond following Túrin's slaying of the [[dragon]] [[Glaurung]] where he claimed its treasures. He was soon after slain by [[Húrin]], but in his dying breaths he cursed the treasure. Mîm's curse would go on to have significant repercussions, including bringing about the eventual ruin of [[Doriath]] during a [[battle in the Thousand Caves]].

While Ibun and Khîm managed to vanish into the dusk, Mîm lagged behind and was seized, though he struggled and bit like a beast, wounding Andróg's hand. Andróg declared Mîm to be an [[Orc]] or of Orc-kin, and called for him to be slain, and was echoed by another outlaw, [[Ulrad]], who felt cheated on finding that Mîm's sack seemingly only contained roots and small stones. The leader of the outlaws, '''Neithan''' ([[Túrin]] in disguise), stayed them however, and bid for Mîm to be let up and permitted to speak.<ref name=\"mim\" /> \n\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Mîm Pleads For His Life.jpg|thumb|right|''Mîm Pleads For His Life'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nMîm, stumbling on his knees before Túrin's feet, pleaded that he was old and poor, and for Túrin to not let him be slain for no cause. Túrin, in response, asked what Mîm could offer in ransom and noted that his men were looking for a dwelling. Mîm then offered that while he could not give up his dwelling, he could share it. Túrin accepted this, and swore to a weeping Mîm that if they were brought to his home without any trickery, and it was good, then he would not be slain by any of Túrin's followers. As it was late and dark, Mîm initially wished to depart and return for them in the light, but Túrin denied this without the pledge of his sack. Mîm refused to be parted from it, and thus Túrin had him led to their dismal camp, with Mîm cursing along the way in a strange tongue full of ancient hatred; when they arrived, the Men then put bonds on his legs, at which he went suddenly quiet.<ref name=\"mim\" />\n\nThe next morning they released Mîm, and he spoke fiercely that bonds should not be put on a Dwarf, that he would not forgive them for it, and that he repented his promise. Túrin responded that Mîm was still to lead them to his home, and then looked Mîm in the eyes until Mîm could no longer endure it; Mîm turned away and beckoned for Túrin and his men to follow him.<ref name=\"mim\" />\n\nMîm guided the outlaws, and they spent the day marching to [[Amon Rûdh]]. Once there they climbed through hidden and perilous paths until they eventually arrived at the entrance of Bar-en-Nibin-noeg where Mîm bid them enter and renamed the dwelling as the [[House of Ransom]]. As they entered into the darkness, Mîm clapped his hands and Ibun appeared from around a corner with a small torch. Ibun then informed Mîm that Khîm had been struck by the earlier arrow, and had just died at sunset. Mîm was grieved at this, and exclaimed that being held in bondage by the outlaws had prevented him from able to heal him. Túrin, pitying Mîm, claimed that he would hold himself in Mîm's debt, and promised that if he should come to any wealth he would pay Mîm a ransom of heavy gold in token of sorrow. Mîm marvelled at Túrin, but stated that Andróg must break his bow and arrows and lay them at his sons feet; he further cursed Andróg that he shall never again take arrow or bow, otherwise he shall die by it. Andróg, with great grudge, did this, but himself muttered a curse that Mîm should die with a dart in his throat.<ref name=\"mim\" />\n\n[[File:Peter_Xavier_Price_-_Turin_and_Mim.jpg|thumb|right|''Turin and Mim'' by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]]\nThe next day Mîm stated that he and Ibun would serve as guides when the Men went out, and shared his [[earth-bread]] with them excepting Ulrad who he had harsh words for as one of those that put bonds upon him. The outlaws remained there for the rest of year, going on no more raids and only stirring abroad for hunting or gathering of food. The Men started to feel that life would be better if the space were not shared with Mîm, as he would appear out of some shadowy corner or doorway when they thought him elsewhere and thus made them uneasy. It was otherwise for Túrin however, as he became ever more friendly with Mîm, and would sit for hours listening to his councils, lore, and [[The Complaint of Mîm the Dwarf|tales]] of his life. Mîm in turn was pleased by this, and to Túrin alone would he admit at times to his smithy.<ref name=\"mim\" />\n\nIn midwinter, [[Beleg]] the [[Elf]], a dear friend of Túrin, suddenly came among them, bearing great items such as the [[Helm of Hador]] and [[lembas]] of [[Melian]].<ref name=\"mim\" /> Mîm hated Beleg, as he did all Elves, and this grew as he became jealous of the love that Túrin bore to Beleg. This hatred became all the fiercer when Beleg seemingly undid the curse he had laid on Andróg: the outlaw had taken up bow again, and was struck by a poisoned orc-arrow, but his life was saved by Beleg.<ref name=bowhelm>{{CH|8}}</ref> It further came into Mîm's mind that if were to eat the lembas he would renew his youth and grow strong again; since he could not come by it through stealth, he feigned sickness and begged it from Beleg, but the Elf refused, and thus the seal was set on Mîm's hatred.<ref>{{UT|2o}}</ref>\n\nTogether, Túrin and Beleg did great deeds and pushed back [[Morgoth]]'s forces, but in response Morgoth sent a great many spies to locate their hideout. Mîm became aware of the presence of Orcs in the lands about Amon Rûdh, and he and his son Ibun soon became ensnared with them. Differing tales speak of this being either an intentional act by Mîm due to the hatred he bore against Beleg, or unintentional due to Ibun being captured and threatened with torture. Either way, Mîm agreed to lead Morgoth's forces to Túrin's hiding place, but on the following conditions: that he be paid the weight of iron for any Man they caught or slew, but of Túrin and Beleg in gold; for Mîm's house be left after to him and him alone; for Beleg be left bound for Mîm to deal with; and for Túrin to be let go free. The emissary of Morgoth readily agreed, though with no real intention of upholding his promises, and insisted that Ibun be kept as a hostage. Mîm became afraid, and tried to back out, but with the Orcs holding Ibun, he was obliged to guide them.<ref name=bowhelm>{{CH|8}}</ref>\n\nMîm led the Orcs through the secret paths, resulting in the [[sack of Bar-en-Danwedh|sacking of the hideout]]. All of the outlaws were struck down, with Andróg being mortally wounded by an arrow, and Túrin and Beleg captured with nets. Túrin was carried off, but Beleg was left wounded and bound with his wrists and ankles tied to iron pins driven into the rock. Mîm, who had been lurking in the caves during the battle, then emerged and gloated over Beleg while he sharpened a knife. Andróg, however, managed to crawl through the dead bodies and seized a sword which he thrust at the Dwarf. Shrieking in fear, Mîm fled, retreating down a steep and difficult goat's path.<ref name=bowhelm /><ref group=\"note\">In ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' when Mîm approached Beleg, he picked up [[Anglachel]] from the ground instead of using his knife; Beleg, while not bound, was sorely wounded but managed to wrest the blade from Mîm and scare him away.</ref>\n\n===Return to Nargothrond and death===\nIn {{FA|499}}, after Túrin had slain [[Glaurung]], Mîm made his way back to Nargothrond. Finding the halls and treasure unguarded, he took possession of them, and sat there in joy fingering the gold and gems, and letting them run ever through his hands.<ref name=q14>{{SM|Q14}}</ref>\n\nIn {{FA|502|n}}, [[Húrin]], father of Túrin who had witnessed all that had happened due to being cursed to see with Morgoth's eyes, came across Mîm in Nargothrond. Húrin then slew Mîm, but with his dying breath Mîm cursed the treasure of Nargothrond. Húrin then carried the treasure to [[Doriath]].<ref name=Hurin>{{WJ|Hurin}}</ref>{{rp|257-258}}\n\n==Legacy==\nThingol employed the [[Dwarves of the Blue Mountains]] to work with the treasure, with the most prominent creation being the [[Nauglamír]] bearing a [[Silmaril]]. Enmity arose between Thingol and the Dwarves over this, culminating in a [[battle in the Thousand Caves]].<ref>{{LR|P2III}}</ref> One of the justifications the Dwarves used when claiming the treasure was that it had been taken with violence and murder from a Dwarf, even though Mîm was not in fact akin to them.<ref group=\"note\">This detail is provided in [[Concerning ...

He was left watch Glorund's dwelling and treasury when Glorund set forth to confront Turambar. \n\nEventually, however, Glorund was slain and Turambar's father, Úrin, came with a band of rogue Elves to take the treasure. On entering the caves of the Rodothlim, they found that all the Orcs had fled following the death of Glorund, and only Mîm still remained, \"an old misshapen dwarf who sat ever on the pile of gold singing black songs of enchantment to himself\".\n\nWhen the Elves approached, Mîm stood before the doors of the cave that were once the abode of [[Galweg]]. Mîm warned them hearken to the words of \"Mîm the fatherless\" that they should touch the gold \"no more than were it venomous fires\": it was cursed for Glorund having lain on it for many years, with only Mîm being able to ward it, and by many a dark spell he had bound it to himself. Though Úrin initially wavered, he still bid his men to seize the treasure, and Mîm then broke forth into terrible curses, and for those evil words Úrin then smote him. Dying, Mîm uttered a final curse on the gold: “Now Elves and Men shall rue this deed, and because of the death of Mîm the dwarf shall death follow this gold so long as it remain on Earth, and a like fate shall every part and portion share with the whole.”<ref>{{LT2|II}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Nauglafring]]'', the treasure is brought before King Tinwelint of Artanor (Thingol of Doriath) and the curse of Mîm begins its course with greed for the treasure resulting in fighting between Úrin's outlaws and Tinwelint's woodland Elves. After the outlaws were slain, the Queen, Gwenniel (Melian), warns Tinwelint to touch not the gold as it is \"trebly cursed\": by the dragon's breath, by the blood of Tinwelint's subjects, and by the death of the outlaws; even more than that though, \"some more bitter and more binding ill\" hung over it which she could not see.<ref name=\"nauglafring\">{{LT2|IV}}</ref>\n\nAt the suggestion of [[Ufedhin]], Tinwelint eventually agreed to have the Dwarves of Nogrod forge items from this treasure, with the greatest of them being the Nauglafring (Nauglamír), a carcanet intended to host the Silmaril. After Tinwelint donned the Nauglafring, and the curse of Mîm fell upon him, the Dwarves then asked an outrageous price for their work; for their insolence Tinwelint instead had them whipped and sent off with a meagre reward.<ref name=\"nauglafring\" />\n\n[[Naugladur]], the King of Nogrod, then long pondered how to both avenge this insult and sate his greed. Messengers then arrived from [[Bodruith]], the King of the Dwarves of Belegost, informing Naugladur how the treasure had been acquired by the death of Mîm: at this Naugladur \"vowed to rest not ere Mîm was thrice avenged\" and concluded that \"the gold belongs of right to the people of the Dwarves\". The forces of Nogrod and Belegost, joined with a gathered host of Orcs, eventually attacked Artanor and slew Tinwelint, with Naugladur taking possession of the Nauglafring. The curse continued however, with the Nauglafring causing betrayals by Ufedhin and Bodruith in their attempts to seize it for themselves, and providing Beren a means to slay Naugladur in single combat.<ref name=\"nauglafring\" />\n\n=== The Complaint of Mîm the Dwarf ===\n{{Quote|If only I could forgive, I might still catch the shape of one leaf at least, of one flower with dew on it as it shone in the spring by [[Tarn Aeluin]] when I was young, and the skill first ran down into my fingers.
