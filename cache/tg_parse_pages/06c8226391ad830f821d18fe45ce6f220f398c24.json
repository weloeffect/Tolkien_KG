Atop a rise, he sees a huge number of [[Orcs]] marching in formation. Shocked at this, he rides Brego at a canter until he reaches [[Helm's Deep]]. \n\nInside the keep, rumour spreads ahead of Aragorn that he is alive and has arrived. [[Gimli]] approaches and is overjoyed to see him alive. He tells Aragorn where [[Théoden]] is, and on his way to the king, Aragorn encounters [[Legolas]], who returns the Evenstar to him. [[Éowyn]] watches this from a distance. \n\nAragorn opens the doors to the hall where Théoden is, and tells him that at least ten thousand orcs are marching on Helm's Deep from [[Isengard]], and that they will arrive by nightfall, much to the shock of Théoden. In response to this, Théoden begins preparing Helm's Deep for the coming battle. \n{{blockquote|I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms to be ready for battle by nightfall. We will cover the causeway and the gate from above. No army has ever breached the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the Hornburg!|[[Théoden]]}}\n\nGimli urges Théoden not to underestimate the [[Uruk-hai]] they will meet in battle, and Aragorn implores him to send out riders, saying that [[Gondor]] will come to their aid. In anger, Théoden insists Gondor have not aided Rohan in the past and will not do so now. He continues preparations for the coming battle as a group of crows gather above the keep. \n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers scenes|43]]"}}}
