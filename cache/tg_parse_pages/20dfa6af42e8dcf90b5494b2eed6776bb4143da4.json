Tolkien]], to be sung to the tune of ''Polly Put the Kettle On''. It is published as the 28th song in ''[[Songs for the Philologists]]'' in [[1936]]. (listed in the table of contents as \"Two Little Schemes\")\n\nIt originally contained direct references to [[Leeds University]], and was altered to omit them during printing. Tolkien noted, in 1966, that the alterations had the unfortunate side effect of breaking the rhyme.<ref>{{HM|A}}Hammond, W. G., Scull, C. [1993] ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography]]''</ref>\n\n;Background\nIn the Department of English at the University of Oxford where Tolkien worked, teaching was divided into two streams. \"Lit'\" meant \"English Literature\", i.e. the study of works from Shakespeare to modern times, whereas \"Lang'\" meant \"English Language\", meaning the philological study of Old English texts such as ''[[Beowulf (poem)|Beowulf]]'', and Middle English, such as ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]''. Tolkien and [[Gordon]] were philologists and firmly in the \"Lang'\" camp, but they could see that it was dying out.\n\n==The song==\n[[Image:Songs for the Philologists page 2.jpeg|thumb|200px|The poem as it appears in ''[[Songs for the Philologists]]'']]\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\n'''Lit' and Lang<nowiki>'</nowiki>'''\n\nOnce there were two little groups,\nOnce there were two little groups,\nOnce there were two little groups,\n        Called Lit' and Lang'.\nLit' was lazy till she died,\nLit' was lazy till she died,\nLit' was lazy till she died,\n        Of homophemes.\n'I don't like philology,'\n        Poor Lit' said.\nPsychotherapeutics failed,\n        And now she's dead.\n\nDoctors cut up all the corpse,\nDoctors cut up all the corpse,\nDoctors cut up all the corpse,\n        But searched in vain;\nThey couldn't find it anywhere,\nThey couldn't find it anywhere,\nThey couldn't find it anywhere,\n        They couldn't find the brain.\nDid Lang' go into mourning-weeds?\n        I don't think!\nHe quickly wiped a tear away\n        And had another drink.\n</poem>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Poems and songs in Songs for the Philologists]]"}}}
