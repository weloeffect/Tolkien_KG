He was a powerful but relatively small and graceful fallen Fire Spirit, known to the [[Avari]] as ''Múar the East-demon''.\n\n==History==\n===First Age===\nMúar was originally a servant of the Vala [[Vána|Vana]] and a companion to the Maia [[Arien]]. He joined [[Morgoth]]'s rebellion and entered Middle-earth, serving the Dark Lord during the Elder Days. Due to his \"peculiar grace and stealth,\" Morgoth appointed him as Warlord of Uax after the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath|Battle Under Stars]]. While less powerful than other Balrogs, Múar was a swift and intelligent commander who led campaigns against the Avari tribes of northeastern Middle-earth. He survived Morgoth's final defeat at the end of the First Age.\n\n===Second Age===\nAfter the downfall of Morgoth, Múar was trapped for centuries beneath the [[Iron Mountains]] of Uab. He was eventually freed around {{SA|1100}} and spent two decades gathering the Orcs of the Oronangri and Orocarni mountains. By {{SA|1143}}, Múar's forces had conquered a vast territory, subjugating the Fale tribes and establishing a kingdom that stretched two thousand miles south of the Iron Mountains.\n\nIn {{SA|1144}}, Múar's armies began to attack the Horl and later the [[Dwarves]] of Ruuriik. The Dwarven Houses of Drúin and Barin joined forces in a thirteen-year war against him. Despite their resistance, Múar eventually captured the Dwarf-capital, Tumunamahal (also known as Akhuzdah), killing both King Barin III and King Drárin. Only a few Dwarves escaped, with a small remnant establishing themselves in the mine-city of Khazad-madûr.\n\nOver the next thirteen centuries, Múar's kingdom was weakened by rebellions and the machinations of [[Sauron]]. He lost most of his territory, save for the land of Ruuriik, and watched as the [[Womaw]] and [[Númenórean]]s began to dominate the eastern trade routes.\n\n===Death===\nMúar's eventual demise came at the hands of the very Dwarves he had fought. In {{SA|2741}}, a Dwarven expedition led by King Fulla of Drúin's line sought out the survivors in Khazad-madûr. The expedition's arrival inadvertently allowed Múar to enter the refuge, where he killed Lord Dáin and his son Báin. However, the Dwarves managed to slay the Balrog in the ensuing battle. A year later, they reclaimed their ancient capital of Tumunamahal.<ref name=\"muar\">{{ICE|2006}}, pp. 113-116</ref>\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Balrogs from adaptations]]\n[[Category:Middle-earth Role Playing characters]]"}}}
