Issue #1 includes a reference to [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[Letter to Dick Plotz (8 April 1968)|letter to Dick Plotz]], president of the [[Tolkien Society of America]]. \n\n==Extract==\n\nJRR TOLKIEN has written to the Tolkien Society of America to inform them that the book [[The Tolkien Relation]] by [[William Ready]] (Henry Regnery Co., Chicago) was published without his cooperation or consent, and to point out that it has a number of errors (for example, on p.&nbsp;46 there is a reference to Bilbo's wife).Tolkien says he does not wish to cause a public furore over the book, but he resquest TSA members not to buy it.\n\nOther errors have been pointed out, as for example the reference to LoTR as a trilogy; it is not, as Tolkien has taken pains to point out in the past. It is one story published in three volumes. In addition, Professor Tolkien, who is quite jealous of his personal life, is presumably annoyed with the inclusion of biographical data in the book.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Letter to Dick Plotz (8 April 1968)]]\n\n==External links==\n* '''[https://locusmag.com/ Official magazine website]'''\n\n{{title|journal}}\n[[Category:Magazines]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
