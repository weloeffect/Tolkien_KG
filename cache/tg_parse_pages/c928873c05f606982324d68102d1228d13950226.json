Where those streams met, an ancient east-west road crossed the upper reaches of the river at a ford. The ford marked the boundary between two regions. To the east was [[Himlad]], and the other lands held by the sons of [[Fëanor]]. To the west was [[Dor Dínen]], and beyond it the perilous valley of [[Nan Dungortheb]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Fords of Aros seem to date back to the days before the beginning of the [[Years of the Sun]], when the roads north of [[Doriath]] were safe to travel. After the coming of [[Ungoliant]], and the raising of the [[Girdle of Melian]], the lands west of the Arossiach became a haunted and dangerous place, and in the late [[First Age]] the Fords were only used by the bravest or most desperate travellers.<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>\n\n[[Aredhel]], after leaving her brother [[Turgon]] and the city of [[Gondolin]], desired to see the sons of [[Fëanor]].  Denied entrance into [[Doriath]], she took the road north of the Hidden Kingdom and crossed the Aros at the Arossiach on her journey into Himlad.<ref>{{S|Maeglin}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Arossiach'' is a [[Sindarin]] name meaning \"Fords of Aros\", from ''[[Aros]]'' + ''[[iach]]'' (\"ford\").\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Beleriand]]\n[[Category:Fords]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n\n[[de:Arossiach]]\n[[fi:Arossiach]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/ponts et gues/beleriand/arossiach]]"}}}
