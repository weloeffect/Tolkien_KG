Tolkien, Robert E. Howard and the Birth of Modern Fantasy''''' is a 2015 book which explores the emergence of the genre [[Wikipedia:Fantasy|Fantasy]], with a special focus on [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and [[Robert E. Howard]].\n\n==From the publisher==\n\n{{blockquote|The birth of modern fantasy in 1930s Britain and America saw the development of new literary and film genres. J.R.R. Tolkien created modern fantasy with ''The Lord of the Rings'', set in a fictional world based upon his life in the early 20th century British Empire, and his love of language and medieval literature. In small-town Texas, Robert E. Howard pounded out his own fantasy realm in his Conan stories, published serially in the ephemeral pulp magazines he loved. Jerry Siegel created Superman with Joe Shuster, and laid the foundation for perhaps the most far-reaching fantasy worlds: the universe of DC and Marvel comics.The work of extraordinary people who lived in an extraordinary decade, this modern fantasy canon still provides source material for the most successful literary and film franchises of the 21st century. Modern fantasy speaks to the human experience and still shows its origins from the lives and times of its creators. Deke Parsons has a Ph.D. in English, with specializations in 20th century British literature and film, from Claremont Graduate University. Donald E. Palumbo is a professor of English at East Carolina University. He lives in Greenville, North Carolina. C.W. Sullivan III is Distinguished Professor of arts and sciences at East Carolina University and a full member of the Welsh Academy. He is the author of numerous books and the on-line journal ''Celtic Cultural Studies''.}}\n\n==Contents==\n\n*Introduction\n*I. J.R.R.
