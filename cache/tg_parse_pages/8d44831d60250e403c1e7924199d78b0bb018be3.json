It is the titular subject of the [[Nazgûl's Citadel]] supplement.\n\n==History==\nConstruction began in {{SA|1938}}, supervised by Akhôrahil's military leader [[Army of the Southern Dragon#Wyatan|Wyatan]], with work being doing alternatively by fine stonemasons from Ciryatanor and Orcs from the Yellow Mountains and Mordor. In {{SA|2000}} Wyatan moved to the fortress, but he was later recalled to Ciryatanor's capital in {{SA|2279}}. After the fall of the Storm King's rule, the fortress was abandoned in {{SA|2285}}. In {{SA|3023}}, Orcs moved into the empty fortress.<ref name=\"citadel\">{{ICE|8205}}, p. 5-6</ref>\n\nAkhôrahil returned in {{TA|1051}} with some followers, and subjugated the Orcs who live there. In {{TA|2182}}, after the Army of the Southern Dragon was defeated at old Chennacatt by the army of Chennacatt, the fortress was ordered to be sealed. Strange lights and foul beasts began to be noticed around {{TA|2400}} as the demon Magurgoth occupied the ruins, and by {{FoA|58}} he had gathered a host so large that the fortress formed a threat again.<ref name=\"citadel\"/><ref>{{ICE|8205}}, p. 16</ref>\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Middle-earth Role Playing locations]]"}}}
