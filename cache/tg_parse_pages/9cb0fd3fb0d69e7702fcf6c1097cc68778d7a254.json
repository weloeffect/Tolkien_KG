This allowed their hosts to cross the river more easily, as the battles were mainly in [[Talath Dirnen]]. Thus the hidden realm was revealed to the Enemy and his wrath.<ref>{{CH|10}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alan Lee - Fall of Nargothrond.jpg|180px|left|thumb|''Fall of Nargothrond'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]\nIn the spring of {{FA|495}}, the Elves [[Gelmir (messenger of Círdan)|Gelmir]] and [[Arminas]] came to Nargothrond in name of [[Círdan]], bringing news from [[Ulmo]]: [[Eithel Sirion]] had been tainted by [[Morgoth]], and Ulmo's power was now withdrawn from the [[Sirion]]; therefore, Nargothrond should close its doors and destroy its bridge, so the Enemy would not find the hidden realm. Orodreth was troubled by this warning, but Túrin did not hearken to it, and refused to destroy the mighty bridge.<ref name=Fall>{{CH|11}}</ref>\n\nIn late autumn of the same year, the hosts of Nargothrond were defeated in the [[Battle of Tumhalad]], after which [[Glaurung]] led his [[Orcs]] to Nargothrond. In that moment the bridge proved a folly, as it was too big and strong, and could not be swiftly destroyed. Therefore the guards could do nothing to stop the coming of the enemies, and the doors were destroyed and the city [[Fall of Nargothrond|sacked]]. Thereafter all the inhabitants were killed or enslaved, and Glaurung destroyed the bridge and took the caves as his lair.<ref name=Fall />\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Beleriand]]\n[[Category:Bridges]]"}}}
