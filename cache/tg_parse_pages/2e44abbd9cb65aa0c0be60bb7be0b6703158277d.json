Whereas the other nine chapters of Part One of this book describe the histories of writing of [[The Prologue]] and the [[Appendices]] to ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', this one chapter details how this section of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' came into being. [[Christopher Tolkien]] justified this arrangement by noting that the Tale of Years for the [[Second Age]] was clearly linked to the evolution of the history of [[Númenor]] and its downfall.<ref name=Akallabeth>{{PM|Akallabeth}}</ref>{{rp|140}}\n\nEarlier versions of the ''[[Akallabêth]]'' had been discussed in previous parts of the History of Middle-earth series but how the version used in the ''Silmarillion'' developed had not been revealed. While the final ''Akallabêth'' post-dated the writing of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Christopher stated that in ''[[Sauron Defeated]]'' he mistakenly ascribed the writing of this text to the mid-1960s. The line of Númenórean kings in [[Appendix A]] showed that the development of the ''Akallabêth'' came much earlier.<ref name=Akallabeth />{{rp|140–141}}\n\nChristopher identified the texts in the stages of the writing of this work as follows: The earliest was a clear manuscript of twenty-three pages, which he called text 'A'. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] made many corrections to the first part of A (but few to the account of the Downfall) and this became text 'B'. Christopher felt that B followed closely upon A, then B was left alone for a while before Tolkien emended it and greatly extending the history of Númenor. A final text, 'C', was made from B when all the alterations were complete, and Christopher dated this version to 1958. To indicate the version of B with it many alterations Christopher designated this text as 'B2'. However, Christopher stressed that much of the ''Akallabêth'' stayed the same from the first writings. In recognition of this fact, the entire ''Akallabêth'' from ''The Silmarillion'' was not reproduced; instead Christopher referenced selected paragraphs from that work to describe alterations from version A.<ref name=Akallabeth />{{rp|141–142}}\n\n==Points of interest==\n* In text A the story was addressed to [[Ælfwine]] of England by [[Pengolodh]] the Wise. This \"framing structure\" was a feature of the early texts of Tolkien's legendarium that was dropped.\n\n* ''[[Vingilot]]'' was the name of [[Eärendil]]'s ship in texts A and B. Tolkien changed it to ''Eälótë'' in B2. This name was not used elsewhere so in ''The Silmarillion'' Christopher reverted to Vingilot.\n\n* In texts A and B, it was Fionwë, the ''son'' of [[Manwë]], who overthrew [[Morgoth]]. In B2 Fionwë was replaced by [[Eönwë]], the ''herald'' of [[Manwë]], and in the published ''Silmarillion'' the reference to either name was removed. Christopher believed that his father had diminished the once-important role of the children of the [[Valar]] and thus removed all references to them. However, Christopher later felt the omission may have been an error on his part.<ref name=Akallabeth />{{rp|143}}\n\n* The lifespan of the [[Númenóreans]] was set at \"thrice that of Men of [[Middle-earth]]\" but for the \"descendants of [[Hador]] the Fair even longer years were granted\".<ref name=Akallabeth />{{rp|144}}\n\n* Contrary to some legends of the founding of Númenor, the [[Edain]] did not sail at one time and in one fleet. First [[Elros]] led a small expedition to the island. This was followed by small fleets or even single ships, all of which were built according to Elvish models and all were piloted by one of the [[Eldar]] selected by [[Círdan]]. When Elros actually moved to Númenor his fleet numbered from one hundred and fifty to two or three hundred ships (holding between five thousand up to ten thousand people). The migration took at least fifty years until Círdan, instructed by the Valar, stopped providing ships and guides.<ref name=Akallabeth />{{rp|144–145}}\n\n* The Eldarin name of the capital, [[Armenelos]], was originally ''Tar Kalimos''. In the Númenórean tongue the name of the city was ''Arminalêth''.<ref name=Akallabeth />{{rp|145}}\n\n* The central mountain in Númenor was first named ''Menelmin''. This changed to ''Menelmindon'', ''Menelmindo'', and ''Menelminda'' in various works but finally settled upon ''[[Meneltarma]]'', which was used in the later part of text A.<ref name=Akallabeth />{{rp|146}}\n\n* In an isolated page Tolkien set out a brief calculation of the death of the kings of Númenor. Elros was the first but not numbered in the line of kings. The last king was ''Tarkalion'' or ''[[Ar-Pharazôn|Arpharazôn]]'', who was numbered as the thirteenth.<ref name=Akallabeth />{{rp|150–151}}\n\n* Christopher noted that in an original draft for text A the Númenóreans had conceived of a land of shades where the dead existed and that those that died should come bearing shadows of their possessions. This observation was not included in the finished text A or in any subsequent versions.<ref name=Akallabeth />{{rp|152}}\n\n* In texts A and B, Ar-Pharazôn's ship was named ''Aglarrâma''. In B2 it was renamed ''[[Alcarondas|Alkarondas]]''.<ref name=Akallabeth />{{rp|156}}\n\n* All of the texts had the [[Faithful]] fleeing Númenor in twelve ships. However, in text C Tolkien changed the number to nine<ref>{{PM|Akallabeth}}, p. 157</ref> in order to fit the song that [[Gandalf]] sang while riding [[Shadowfax]] with [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] on the journey to [[Minas Tirith]].<ref>{{TT|III11}}</ref>\n\n==Concerning the Marriage of Míriel and Pharazôn==\nTolkien did a lot of work on their story. Attached to text B was a long rider that led to text B2, and inserted into this rider were sheets concerning Míriel and Pharazôn. In order to clarify the discussion of these pieces Christopher laid out the genealogy of the end of the royal houses of Númenor, noting in particular that [[Amandil]] originally had a brother ''Elentir'' who appears in no other place. Christopher then discusses four inserted pages related to the marriage.<ref>{{PM|Akallabeth}}, ''Note on the marriage of Míriel and Pharazôn'', p. 159</ref>\n\nIn the first, designated (a), Ar-Pharazôn was of great beauty and strength, but was corrupted by his father's counsels and the people's acclaim. Míriel was loved by Elentir but she became enraptured by Pharazôn. After her father's death Míriel married Pharazôn and yielded the sceptre to him.<ref>{{PM|Akallabeth}}, ''Note on the marriage of Míriel and Pharazôn, (a)'', pp. 159-160</ref>\n\nIn the page designated (b), a very rough document, Míriel was still enamoured of Pharazôn, but this occurred while she was betrothed to Elentir.<ref>{{PM|Akallabeth}}, ''Note on the marriage of Míriel and Pharazôn, (b)'', p. 161</ref>\n\nIn page (c) Míriel loved Elentir and was ''soon to be'' betrothed to him. This text was abandoned before Pharazôn's role was described.<ref>{{PM|Akallabeth}}, ''Note on the marriage of Míriel and Pharazôn, (c)'', p. 162</ref>\n\nIn page (d) Míriel's love of Pharazôn is missing. Considering the four pages Christopher believed that his father had begun to doubt that the marriage had been against Míriel's will and sketched this new version, but finally abandoned it. In doing so Amandil's brother Elentir disappeared.<ref>{{PM|Akallabeth}}, ''Note on the marriage of Míriel and Pharazôn, (d)'', pp. 162-163</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:The Peoples of Middle-earth chapters|History of the Akallabeth]]"}}}
