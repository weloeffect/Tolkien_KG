Karsh was invented by [[Electronic Arts]] for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth Anthology|The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'' series, where he is voiced by [[Jason Connery]].\n\n==History== \nCarthean was a celebrated [[Dúnedain of Arnor|Arnorian]] general. He defended [[Cardolan]], where the [[Barrow-downs|burial grounds of the deceased kings of Arnor]] lay, from the [[Witch-king]] and his servants. He failed, and at the end, [[Morgomir]] turned him into the [[Wraiths|wraith]] Karsh. Since then, Karsh is devoted to the Iron Crown of [[Angmar]].\n\n[[Category:Men from adaptations]] \n[[Category:Undead from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Battle for Middle-earth (video game series) characters]]\n\n[[fi:Karsh (pelihahmo)]]"}}}
