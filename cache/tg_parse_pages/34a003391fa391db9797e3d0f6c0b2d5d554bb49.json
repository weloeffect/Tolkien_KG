He was married to a woman, named Ioreth, and he had a son with her, named Dirhael, and they were all killed by servants of [[Sauron]]. The wraith of [[Celebrimbor]] inhabited his body, making Talion unable to die and allowing both him and Celebrimbor to seek vengeance on Sauron for killing their families.\n\nHe is voiced by [[Troy Baker]].\n\n==Etymology==\n[[Wiktionary:talion|Talion]] is an English word of French/[[Latin]] derivation, meaning \"retaliation, retribution; punishment; an eye for an eye\".\n\n==Inspiration==\nThe character of Talion is inspired by [[Boromir]].<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/shadow-of-mordor-has-only-scratched-the-surface-of/1100-6424332/|articlename=\nShadow of Mordor Has 'Only Scratched the Surface' of Monolith's Middle-earth\n|dated=20 December 2014|website=[https://www.gamespot.com Gamespot]|accessed=04 January 2022}}</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=Austin Walker|articleurl=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2014/10/real-human-beings-shadow-of-mordor-watch-dogs-and.html|articlename=\nReal Human Beings: Shadow of Mordor, Watch Dogs\n|dated=10 October 2014|website=[http://www.pastemagazine.com/ Pastemagazine]|accessed=04 January 2022}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Men from adaptations]]\n[[Category:Middle-earth: Shadow (video game series) characters]]"}}}
