The true identities of the Hunter and the Rider is unknown. The legend could have had its source in lies spread by [[Morgoth|Melkor]] about [[Oromë]], in an attempt to deceive the Elves into thinking that he was evil. It is also possible that the Hunter and the Rider were some of the \"shadows and evil [[spirits]]\" sent by Melkor to spy upon and harass the [[Quendi]], some [[Maiar]] loyal to Melkor, or even Melkor himself.<ref name=\"Main\">{{S|3}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[Melkor]] was the first of the [[Ainur]] to know of the [[Awakening of the Elves]]. He sent [[Úmaiar]] to trouble and hinder the first [[Elves]] at [[Cuiviénen]]. Any elves that wandered away from the larger group were captured by the servants of Melkor, and taken to [[Utumno]]. The spirit or spirits who captured the wandering elves were known in the legends of the Elves as the Hunter. The ancient legends also told of a Rider on horseback who pursued and devoured elves. These legends were created by Melkor. Either his servants took the form of riders, or he spread lies that became legends about the Rider. The purpose of Melkor's deceit was to trick the Elves into fearing [[Oromë]]. Melkor knew that Oromë was the most likely of the Valar to first discover the Elves, and he did not want the Elves to trust him.\n\n{{References}}\n{{Legend}}\n\n[[Category:Servants of Melkor]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Characters of unknown race]]\n\n[[de:Melkor#Namen und Titel]]\n[[fi:Metsästäjä (Esiajat)]]"}}}
