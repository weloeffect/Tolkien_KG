The Gondolindrim were keen in arts and constructions but also valiant fighters.\n\n==History==\nThe first Elves to dwell in Nevrast were Sindar, who had been drawn in days of old to the coasts near [[Mount Taras]] by the comings of Ulmo and [[Ossë]]. At the time the Noldor returned to [[Middle-earth]], most of the Grey-elves of Nevrast still dwelt in the coastal region in the southwest. Turgon settled there with his own people, Noldor of the [[House of Fingolfin]], taking up lordship of Nevrast and building [[Vinyamar]]. The first mingling of Sindar and Noldor took place in Nevrast, and they became one people.<ref name=Beleriand/>\n\nAt Ulmo's urging and with his guidance Turgon, seeking a refuge from [[Morgoth]], found the hidden vale of [[Tumladen]] within the [[Encircling Mountains]]. After [[Dagor Aglareb]] Turgon brought many of the most skilled of the Elves of Nevrast to Tumladen, where they set about building Gondolin in secret. When the city was finished, the people of Nevrast (including one third of the Noldor of Fingolfin, and even more Sindar) abandoned Nevrast and came in secret, in small companies one-by-one, through [[Ered Wethrin]] to Gondolin.<ref name=Noldor/>\n[[File:Alan Lee - Turgon Strengthens the Watch.jpg|thumb|left|''Turgon Strengthens the Watch'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]\nBecause Gondolin was strictly separated from the rest of Beleriand by [[Ered Wethrin]] and it is unlikely that substantial numbers of other kindreds ever came to settle there. Only a few notable outsiders are known to have reached the hidden city: [[Huor]] and [[Húrin Thalion]] were the first [[Men]] to come to Gondolin and dwelt there for a year,<ref name=s18>{{S|18}}.</ref> [[Tuor]], son of Huor, made the city his home<ref name=Tuor/><ref name=\"S23\">{{S|23}}</ref> and [[Maeglin]], son of [[Eöl|Eöl the Dark Elf]] and Turgon's sister [[Aredhel]], fled there with his mother from [[Nan Elmoth]].<ref name=\"S16\">{{S|16}}.</ref>\n\nTo save the Elves, Turgon began to secretly send his people out westward across [[Belegaer]], to seek [[Valinor]] and ask the pardon and aid of the [[Valar]]. None of his mariners succeeded, but this was a wise course, as Turgon would learn later.<ref name=Fingolfin>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>\n\nAs the Elves of [[Beleriand]] began to prepare for a counterstroke to the [[Dagor Bragollach]], Turgon secretly began his own preparations. In {{FA|472}},<ref>{{GA|217}}</ref> the [[Union of Maedhros]] attacked [[Angband]], and Turgon rode to war for the first time. Unknown and unbidden by his kin, he opened the leaguer of Gondolin and rode to their aid with an army of ten thousand. This was to be the disastrous battle that was to become known as the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]. The army of the Gondolindrim escaped from the Fifth Battle thanks to the men of the [[House of Hador]].<ref name=Nirnaeth>{{S|Nirnaeth}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[Fall of Gondolin]], Tuor and Idril gathered as many of the people as they could find, and escaped down their [[Idril's secret way|escape tunnel]]. In the plain they could run unnoticed because of the steam and smoke. It was a hard road through the mountains, and [[Glorfindel]] was killed battling a [[Balrog]] that lay in ambush. But at last the [[Exiles of Gondolin]] came to [[Nan-tathren]]. After resting there for some time they came down to the refuge at the [[Mouths of Sirion]], where they mourned the loss of the White City.<ref name=fall>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nThe Gondolindrim were living under the ultimate law of secrecy and no visitor was ever allowed to leave the city.<ref name=s18/>\n\nGondolin society comprised of houses of nobles with heraldic devices<ref>{{UT|1}}, pp. 46-50</ref> such as the [[House of the Golden Flower]].<ref>{{SM|Q16}}, p. 141</ref>\n\nThe Gondolindrim observed the [[Gates of Summer]] as a celebration.<ref name=fall/>\n==Etymology==\n''Gondolindrim'' is a standard formation of ''Gondolin'' ([[Sindarin|S]]: \"The Hidden Rock\") and the Sindarin suffix ''[[rim|-rim]]'', denoting a people.<ref name=\"SApp\">{{S|Appendix}}.</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n===The Book of Lost Tales===\nIn the earliest version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', the inhabitants of Gondolin were called '''''Gondothlim''''' in [[Gnomish]]<ref>{{LT2|Appendix}}, entry \"Gondothlim\"</ref> or '''''Ondolië''''' in [[Qenya]].<ref>{{PE|13}}, p. 102</ref> \n\nThey were those [[Noldoli]] who escaped from [[Melko]]'s power after the [[Battle of Unnumbered Tears]].<ref name=Tale>{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|157}} When [[Tuor]] arrived to their city, they are described in great detail:\n\n{{blockquote|Indeed the Gondothlim were not bent of back as some of their unhappy kin became, labouring without rest at delving had hammering for Melko, but small were they and slender and lithe.
