It invited scholars to consider the role that diversity plays in Middle-earth's linguistic and literary make-up: how does he explore race, gender, sexuality, disability, class, religion and faith, and age? How do different fandoms receive his works? How can varying perspectives enrich our understanding of Arda? Tolkien and Diversity was the second of three seminars that the Tolkien Society hosted online in 2021, reaching over 1600 global delegates.\n\nPublished under the auspices of the Society's Peter Roe Memorial Fund, this proceedings features a collection of papers delivered at the Tolkien Society 2021 summer seminar.\n}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.tolkiensociety.org/store/tolkien-and-diversity/ Official webpage]\n\n{{peterroe}}\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Publications by the Tolkien Society]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]"}}}
