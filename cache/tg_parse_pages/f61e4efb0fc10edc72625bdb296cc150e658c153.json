Tolkien|Tolkien]] related books and merchandise. Owned and run by [[René van Rossenberg]], the store is located in [[wikipedia:Leiden|Leiden]], the Netherlands. The store also boasts a Tolkien museum. The store is also accessible online in Dutch and English, and could/can also be found at various Fantasy and board gaming related festivals in the Netherlands as well as at Tolkien events throughout Europe.\n\nThe Tolkienwinkel originated as a service by Netherlands Tolkien Society [[Unquendor]] to its members. In the 1990s however, due to sales tax (e.g. VAT) concerns, the Tolkienwinkel was transferred to René van Rossenberg.\n\nIn recent decades the Tolkienwinkel has sold interesting collections: letters and books signed by J.R.R. Tolkien, [[Joy Hill]]'s (Tolkien's private secretary) library, as well as many [[Cor Blok]], [[Sergei Iukhimov]], [[Roger Garland]] and other paintings.\n\nIn October 2011, De Tolkienwinkel celebrated its 25th anniversary.<ref>[http://www.4gm.nl/fantasy-nieuws/34-evenementen/992-tolkienwinkel-viert-zilveren-jubileum.html#.Tl02CaZkHwo.nujij Tolkienwinkel viert zilveren jubileum] at [http://www.4gm.nl/home.html 4GM.com] (accessed 21 October 2011)</ref>\n\n== External links ==\n\n* '''[http://www.tolkienwinkel.nl/ Official Website (Dutch)]'''\n* '''[http://www.xs4all.nl/~rossnbrg/ English Website]'''\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Dutch organizations]]\n[[Category:Dutch businesses]]\n[[Category:Stores]]"}}}
