Imrahil was invented for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'' by [[Amazon Studios]] and is portrayed by an unknown actor.\n\n== History ==\nImrahil was a cadet in training to become a mariner of the [[Guild of Venturers|Sea Guard]] in [[Númenor]]. He is the son of the [[Sail Master]] and was a cadet in training to become a part of the [[Guild of Venturers|Sea Guard]] in [[Númenor]]. He was a friend of [[Isildur]], [[Valandil (The Rings of Power)|Valandil]] and [[Ontamo]]. During one cadet training session, Imrahil made a mistake that led him to go flying off the ship, clinging to the rope that he was supposed to be responsible for. Fortunately for Imrahil, Isildur reacted fast and called the Valandil and Ontamo over to help real Imrahil back onto the ship. Though Imrahil suffered no wounds, he was dismissed from the Sea Guard recruitment training. When the ship returned to Númenor, Ontamo expressed pity for Imrahil while Valandil remarked that Imrahil's father, the Sail Master, did not look pleased. Coincidentally, this was nine days before the [[Sea Trial]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''Imrahil'' is said to be of [[Adûnaic|Númenórean]] origin,<ref>{{App|E}}</ref> though its exact meaning is uncertain.\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | | SAI |y| WIF | | | | |SAI=[[Sail Master]]<br/><small>''b. {{SA}}''</small>|WIF=''unknown wife''<br/><small>''b. {{SA}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | IMR | | | | | | |IMR='''IMRAHIL'''<br/><small>''b. {{SA}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n{{References}}\n\n{{Title}}\n\n[[Category:Men from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) characters]]"}}}
