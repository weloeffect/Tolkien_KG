R. R. TOLKIEN<br/>Oxford 61639<br/>76 SANDFIELD ROAD<br/>HEADINGTON<br/>OXFORD<br/><br/>September 18th.<br/>1967.<br/><br/>Dear Miss Honeybourne,<br/><br/>Thank you very much indeed for your generous and delightful letter, one of the most warming and comforting that I have received.<br/><br/>As I said in the ‘Foreword’ to the American paper-back edition (Ballantine Books), I wrote The Lord of the Rings because I wished ‘to try my hand at a really long story that would hold the attention of readers, amuse them, delight them, and at times maybe excite them or deeply move them.’ As a guide I had only my own feelings for what is appealing or moving; and it has been a great pleasure (and a surprise) to find that so many other people have similar feelings. But no one has written me a letter more warm, and few have come near it.<br/><br/>I am specially grateful for your pleasure in the names: I took a great deal of trouble with them.<br/><br/>Your own name is a delightful one, and brings to me a suggestion of Kinship. It must be derived (as so very many English surnames) from a village name, but the only ones of that name that I know of are the adjacent villages of Church H (Worcs) and Cow H (Glo). These are not far from Blackminster where my brother has a small fruit-farm, in lands where my maternal ancestors (Suffield) can be traced far back.<br/><br/>It is such a good name that I must, in any future more complete map of the Shire (often asked for), find a place for it. It is one of the comparatively rare place-names that means what it says: a stream, of sweet water and/or flowing through flowery meads.<br/><br/>Yours sincerely and gratefully<br/><br/>J.R.R. Tolkien<br/><br/>Incidentally: Cow seems to be a corruption of older Callow ‘bare’ prob. because the land was free from bushes}}\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Letter to Elsie Honeybourne (21 December 1967)]]\n\n== External links ==\n\n*[http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/press/Tolkien_Letter_for_sale.php Tolkien Library]\n{{references}}\n{{title}}\n[[Category:Letters|Honeybourne, Elsie (1967-09-18)]]"}}}
