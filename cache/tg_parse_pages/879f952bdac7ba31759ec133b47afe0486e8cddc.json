Her doctoral studies (Institute for Theology, Imagination and the Arts, University of St Andrews) considered the concept of Mythopoesis / Mythopoeia as defined by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] and [[C.S. Lewis|Lewis]], and as attributed to [[George MacDonald]] – how and why MacDonald earned their acknowledgment as a great mythopoeic writer, and MacDonald’s own mythopoeic intent. Her writings include studies of the work of Tolkien, Lewis, MacDonald, [[Charles Williams]], and [[Owen Barfield]].\n\n\n==Selected Bibliography==\n\n===Book Chapters===\n\n*2007: “Tolkien & Mythopoesis” in ''[http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Tree_of_Tales Tree of Tales: Tolkien, Literature, and Theology],'' ed.
