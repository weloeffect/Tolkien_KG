Tolkien (1892-1973) and on transformative and derivative texts based on his work to a wide and diverse audience. This journal will focus on multi- and inter-disciplinary approaches to Tolkien studies, including gaming, media and literary adaptations, fan productions, and audience reception. The journal therefore offers the opportunity to all scholars working in and on Tolkien research to publish their original research articles in an open access and widely-distributed high quality peer-reviewed scholarly journal at no cost.<ref>[http://scholar.valpo.edu/journaloftolkienresearch/aimsandscope.html Aims & Scope] (The Journal of Tolkien Research; accessed 5.3.2016).</ref>}} \n\n==See also==\n*[http://scholar.valpo.edu/journaloftolkienresearch/vol1/iss1/ Contents: Volume 1, Issue 1 (2014)]\n*[http://scholar.valpo.edu/journaloftolkienresearch/vol2/iss1/ Contents: Volume 2, Issue 1 (2015)]\n*[http://scholar.valpo.edu/journaloftolkienresearch/vol3/iss1/ Contents: Volume 3, Issue 1 (2016)]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://scholar.valpo.edu/journaloftolkienresearch/ Official website]\n\n{{references}}\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Journals]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[fi:Journal of Tolkien Research]]"}}}
