In the battle the [[Orcs]] had taken the [[Pass of Aglon]], but Maedhros was later able to retake the Pass using the forces from Himring.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>\n\nHimring's fortress remained for centuries, until the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]; where the sons of Fëanor forsook it.<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref> After the Nirnaeth, the hill of Himring became garrisoned by soldiers of Angband.<ref>{{GA|242}}</ref>\n\n===The Island===\n[[File:Didier Willis - Location of Tol Morwen.png|thumb|300px|Remnants of sunken Beleriand: the islands west of Forlindon, Tol Himling, [[Tol Fuin]] and (speculatively) [[Tol Morwen]].]]\nAfter the [[War of Wrath]], when the western lands were flooded, the plains about the hill were drowned and the top of the hill was all that remained of Himring.
