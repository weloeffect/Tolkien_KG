The Poros was crossed by the [[Harad Road]].<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Poros formed the northern border of the region of Harondor ([[South Gondor]]), and the southern border of [[Ithilien]]. During the later [[Third Age]] it was the effective southern border of Gondor.\n\nAround {{TA|1944}} some [[Haradrim]] had crossed the Poros to [[South Ithilien]], but they were defeated by the [[Southern Army]].<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|2885}}, the [[Haradrim]] crossed the Poros and invaded [[Ithilien]] with great strength. Reinforced by [[Rohan]], Steward [[Túrin II]] won a victory at the [[crossings of Poros]], though the Rohirrim princes [[Fastred (son of Folcwine)|Fastred]] and [[Folcred]] were slain.<ref>{{App|Mark}}</ref> The ''[[Haudh in Gwanûr]]'' was made where the Poros was crossed by the Harad Road.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe meaning of the name ''Poros'' is unknown.<ref>[http://lingwe.blogspot.com/2011/10/poros-and-borphorus.html The Poros and the Bosphorus] at [http://lingwe.blogspot.com/ Lingwë.blogspot.com] (accessed 12 October 2011)</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nA map that was drawn by J.R.R. Tolkien after the [[The First Map of The Lord of the Rings|First Map of The Lord of the Rings]] carries a note where \"Boundary\" is written after Poros. Other rivers except the Anduin and the Poros on this note are either under a a heading \"From East\" or under a heading \"From West\", which probably refers to on which side of the river Anduin in Gondor they are located.<ref>{{TI|First}}, p. 312</ref> This probably means that the river Poros was at the boundary of Gondor.\n\n[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] speculated in ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'' that the [[Sea of Helcar]] drained into the [[Great Gulf]], and that Poros is what remained of the narrow region called the [[Straits of the World]] that once separated the Sea from the Gulf. Fonstand's interpretation was predicated on the ideas that [[Mordor]] did not exist in the First Age, and its location in the Second and later Ages overlapped the area occupied by the Sea of Helcar in the First Age.<ref>{{HM|AME}}, p.37</ref> \n\nHowever, in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'' (which was published after Fonstand's ''Atlas''), [[Melkor]] was said to have created [[Mount Doom]] in Mordor during the \"long [[First Age]]\".<ref>{{PM|Last}}, p.390 (note 14)</ref> Additionally, it is told in ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' that the migration of the [[Drúedain]] from [[Hildórien]] brought them westward through lands south of Mordor, and that they became the first Men to cross the [[Anduin]].<ref>{{UT|Druedain}}, pp. 339-340</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2014: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Though the main course if the Poros is not yet in-game, its in-flow into the [[Anduin]] can be observed near [[Pelargir]]. It is known as \"Kaskûr\" to the people of [[Near Harad]].\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Noldorin locations]]\n[[Category:Rivers]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n\n[[de:Poros]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/eaux/gondor/poros]]\n[[fi:Poros]]"}}}
