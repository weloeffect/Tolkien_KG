It contains the first version of the [[Ainulindalë (Rúmil's work)|''Ainulindalë'' (Rúmil's work)]] written in the 1930s after the \"[[The Music of the Ainur]]\", published in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]''.\n\n==Synopsis==\n:''See synopsis given in \"[[The Music of the Ainur#The Music of the Ainur|The Music of the Ainur]]\"''\n\nThe narrative differences with the previous version are limited to the framework. Now Rúmil of [[Tol Eressëa]] is [[Rúmil (elf of Tirion)|Rúmil]] of [[Tûn]], and [[Eriol]] is named by his [[Old English|English]] name ''[[Ælfwine]]''. Rúmil is still the one who told the story to Eriol, but it is written down as a proper work.\n\n==Commentary==\nThis text follows directly the cosmological myth given in ''The Book of Lost Tales'', but now as an independent work. Both the ''[[Sketch of the Mythology]]'' and ''[[The Quenta]]'' ommited the creation of the world, but [[Tolkien]] did not abandone it, but composed this new version with the Lost Tale in front of him, rephrasing most of it but without summarizing, unlike the rest of the mythology.<ref name=Ainulindale>{{LR|P2IV}}</ref>{{rp|155}} \n\nOf this version, Tolkien made two manuscripts, which [[Christopher Tolkien]] names ''Ainulindalë'' A and ''Ainulindalë'' B. The first is extremely rough, full of changes at the moment of composition concerning the removal of the Lost Tales context. This only has the title ''The Music of the Ainur'' added later. The ''Ainulindalë'' B was probably made right after the previous one, being a handsome manuscript with just a few stilistic changes in the narrative. It includes the [[Elvish]] title ''Ainulindalë'' and the authorship of [[Rúmil (elf of Tirion)|Rúmil]], relating it with \"The Gnomes Material\" like ''[[The Ambarkanta]]'' and ''[[The Lhammas]]''.<ref name=Ainulindale/>{{rp|154–5}} \n\nAlthough every sentence was rewritten, the only remarkable difference with the ''[[Ainulindalë]]'' of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' is still the absence of the [[Vision of Ilúvatar]] and the [[Eä|creative word]].<ref name=Ainulindale/>{{rp|166}}\n\nMany years later, Tolkien wrote a new version in [[1946]], of which only a torn page survives.\n\nIn late 1940s, Tolkien lent manuscript B to Mrs. [[Katharine Farrer]] (cf. [[Letter 115]]), which he dubbed \"Flat World Version\" (along with a \"[[Round World]] Version\"). From these derive other versions of the ''[[Ainulindalë (Morgoth's Ring)|Ainulindalë]]'', explained and published in ''[[Morgoth's Ring]]''.<ref>{{MR|Ainu}}, p. 6</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[The Texts and their Relations]]\n\n{{references}}\n{{title}}\n[[Category:The Lost Road and Other Writings chapters]]\n[[fi:Ainulindalë (Lost Road)]]"}}}
