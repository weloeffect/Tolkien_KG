Arador's son [[Arathorn II]] succeeded him, one year before the birth of the [[Aragorn|last Chieftain]].<ref name=\"TAaA\">{{App|Tale}}, p. 1057</ref>\n\n==Location==\nThe Coldfells were located \"north of Rivendell\",<ref name=\"TAaA\"/> but they are not mentioned on any map (or anywhere else, for that matter). Circumstantial evidence suggests the Coldfells were near to or synonymous with the [[Ettenmoors]], which are described as \"the troll-fells north of [[Rivendell]]\"<ref>{{FR|Flight}}, p. 200</ref> or the [[Ettendales]], which are described as \"far north or Rivendell\" and to be \"troll-country\"<ref>{{FR|Flight}}, p. 203</ref>.\n\n==Etymology==\n\"Coldfells\" is an English word, made up of \"cold\" and \"fell.\" \"Fell\" is a dialectical word derived from Old Norse ''fjall'' for a high and barren landscape feature, such as a mountain or moor-covered hill. It is found in place names in parts of Britain that were once under Scandinavian rule.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fell|articlename=Fell)|website=en.wikipedia.org|accessed=26 September 2024}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Coldfells in the south-eastern portion of the region of the Ettenmoors where player vs player play takes place. The land has one keep called Tirith Rhaw that can be controlled by either the forces of Angmar or the Free Peoples of Middle-earth. The Free Peoples own two other locations in the area that cannot be controlled by the forces of Angmar. The non-player characters aligned with the Free Peoples are a faction known as the Coldfells. \n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Eriador]]\n[[Category:Regions]]\n\n[[fi:Hallatunturit]]"}}}
