The Moriondor were invented by [[Amazon Studios]] for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]''.\n\n== History ==\nWhen the [[Elves]] first [[Awakening of the Elves|awoke]], many of them were taken by [[Morgoth]], who tortured and twisted them, until they became the first [[Orcs]], a new and ruinous form of life. Despite being of a higher rank than an average Orc, the Moriondor took orders from Morgoth and [[Sauron]], never operating independently of the [[Dark Lord|Dark Powers]].\n\nDuring the late [[Second Age]] after the [[Udûn (episode)|battle]] of [[Tirharad]], [[Galadriel]] assumes that [[Adar (The Rings of Power)|Adar]] must be one of the Moriondor during her interrogation of him. Adar answers her assumptions with silence, neither confirming nor refuting her assumption.\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Moriondor'' is a [[Quenya]] word that translates to the \"Sons of the Dark\" according to [[Galadriel]]. It is the plural form of ''[[Morion]]'' (\"Dark One\"), which in the context of the [[legendarium]] was an early name of Morgoth.<ref>{{LR|P1III2}}, p.72</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Concepts from adaptations]]"}}}
