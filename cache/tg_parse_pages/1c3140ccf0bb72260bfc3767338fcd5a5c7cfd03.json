Many of Finrod's people were stirred by his speech to once more go to battle until Celegorm and Curufin, with their own Oath awakened, spoke against it. Celegorm drew his sword and, with flaming eyes, spoke wild and potent words of the wrath that would be incurred on Nargothrond and Doriath should the quest be achieved; the sons of Fëanor would slay any that either kept a Silmaril, or gave one to any hands but their own.

While on the hunt, Curufin secretly spoke to Celegorm of Orodreth being a \"dullard slow\" and laid out a plot where they could usurp the throne of Nagrothrond in the event of Finrod's death. With no rumour or tidings of Finrod, Curufin suggested that Celegorm should feign another hunt, but with the actual intent to seek out Finrod; through this they would then either confirm his death, or, if by some grace he was alive and bearing a Silmaril, they could kill him and reclaim it before he returned.

She revealed who she was and of her escape from Doriath in order to rescue Beren, whom she had learned from the visions of her mother [[Melian]] was being held prisoner in [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]], Finrod's former fortress of Minas Tirith now occupied by Sauron. Celegorm, immediately enamoured by her beauty, and Curufin both listened, and gave no indication of their awareness of Beren or his quest. Once Lúthien finished, she besought them for their aid. In private counsel, Curufin explained to Celegorm that they now knew that Finrod had been taken prisoner, where the wolves were coming from, and what answer he should give to Lúthien. Celegorm then addressed Lúthien and told her that their hunting party wasn't adequate to assault such a fortress, but that if she came back with them to Nargothrond, they would then devise aid to rescue Beren.<ref name=Beren/><ref name=Canto8/>{{rp|214–6}}\n\n<!-- Celegorm & Curufin -->\nOnce they returned to Nargothrond however, instead of assisting Lúthien they took her captive. Their hearts had turned to becoming the mightiest of the Noldor princes and making all Elf-kingdoms obedient to the House of Fëanor; only from that position of strength would they then seek the Silmarils. With Finrod to perish in Sauron's dungeons, and Thingol to be coerced into assenting a wedding of Lúthien to Celegorm, they would advance in such power as they would then both usurp Nargothrond and force Doriath into an alliance. Orodreth, though he was aware the purposes of the brothers, was powerless to hinder them as the people of Nargothrond were under their sway and would not heed him.<ref name=Beren/>\n\n===Designs foiled===\n<!-- Celegorm & Curufin -->\nThese treacherous plans were soon laid bare. With the aid of Huan, Lúthien escaped and the pair succeeded in rescuing Beren along with many Elf prisoners from Tol-in-Gaurhoth. When these Elves returned to Nargothrond the people learned of Finrod's death and Lúthien's great deeds and now perceived the brothers to be guided by treachery rather than fear of Morgoth in abandoning Finrod. Additionally, Celegorm had previously dispatched secret messages to Doriath to urge Thingol's suit, which also hinted that he would leave Finrod to die and take the throne of Nargothond;<ref>{{LB|Unwritten}}, p. 278</ref> Thingol in wrath had sent their letters back by his own servants to Orodreth.<ref>{{SM|CQ10}}, p. 67</ref> \n\nThough Celegorm attempted to still the clamours of the people, they grew to calls for the brothers to be slain. Brought before Orodreth, Celegorm stood unbowed with scorn and a menacing anger, while Curufin smiled, though wary-eyed and hand on the haft of his knife. Curufin then laughed and, addressing Orodreth as \"Sir Steward\", noted that they were not accustomed to standing in his hall and requested to know what he sought of them.<ref>{{LB|4}}, p. 318</ref> Orodreth, speaking coldly, stated that they now stood before the king and that they were banished from Nargothrond, and there would never again be love between the realm and the sons of Fëanor. Celegorm and Curufin soon departed and they went alone as none of their people would any longer follow them; even Curufin's son, Celebrimbor, repudiated his fathers deeds and remained behind. Huan, however, still followed his master Celegorm.<ref name=Beren/>\n\n<!-- Celegorm & Curufin -->\n[[File:Ted_Nasmith_-_Beren's_Leap.jpg|thumb|right|''Beren's Leap'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nLeaving Nargothrond, the two brothers rode towards [[Himring]] where Maedhros dwelt. They chanced upon Lúthien and Beren on the way, and charged at them. While Celegorm sought to ride Beren down, Curufin grabbed Lúthien and lifted her to his saddle. Curufin was, however, caught from behind at the throat by the [[Leap of Beren]], and hurled to the ground where Beren then proceeded to throttle him. Celegorm was prevented from assisting Curufin as Huan finally turned from his service and held him at bay. Curufin's life was spared when Lúthien forbid Beren to slay him, so instead Beren stripped Curufin of his gear and weapons, including his knife Angrist, before flinging him away; he further claimed Curufin's horse for the service of Lúthien, telling Curufin to walk back to his kinsfolk. Curufin cursed Beren before joining Celegorm on his horse and they made as if to ride away. Filled with shame and malice though, Curufin took Celegorm's bow and shot two arrows at Lúthien; Huan caught the first in his mouth while the second hit Beren in the breast when he sprang in front of her. Huan then pursued Celegorm and Curufin, and they fled in fear.<ref name=Beren />\n\n===Later deeds in Beleriand===\n<!-- Celegorm & Curufin -->\nThe evil deeds of Celegorm and Curufin impeded the Union of Maedhros against Morgoth.

Gathering a remnant of their forces, they managed to hew their way out, and escaped towards [[Mount Dolmed]].

Dior wore the Silmaril openly, and used its power to restore the realm.
