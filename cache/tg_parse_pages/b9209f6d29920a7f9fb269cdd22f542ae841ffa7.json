The highest peaks in Middle-earth, they were raised by [[Morgoth]], who delved his fortress of [[Angband]] beneath them, and far back into the Iron Mountains.<ref name=LazyMorgan>{{HM|S}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Kenneth Sofia - Fingolfin rides to Angband.png|thumb|left|''Fingolfin rides to Angband'' by [[:Category:Images by Kenneth Sofia|Kenneth Sofia]]]]\nThangorodrim was said to have been the piles of slag from Morgoth's furnaces and rubble from the delving of Angband,<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref> though they were solid enough to form sheer precipices; [[Maedhros]] was chained to a cliff of Thangorodrim,<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref> and [[Húrin]] imprisoned on a high terrace.<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref> The tops of Thangorodrim perpetually smoked, and sometimes spewed forth lava. The three peaks of Thangorodrim functioned as furnaces for Morgoth's great smithies deep in Angband.\n\nFor a time the [[Eagles]] lived on Thangorodrim, but at some time during the First Age they removed to the [[Crissaegrim]] near [[Gondolin]].\n\nAt the base of the south face of the middle peak was the Great [[Gates of Angband]], a deep canyon leading into the mountain, lined with towers and forts. There were also a number of secret gates scattered around the sides of the mountain group, from which Morgoth's hosts could issue forth and surprise their foes.\n\nThangorodrim was destroyed in the [[War of Wrath]] at the end of the First Age when the defeated dragon [[Ancalagon]] the Black fell on them.<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:John Howe - Thangorodrim.jpg|thumb|''Thangorodrim'' by [[John Howe]]]]\nThe position and size of Thangorodrim are unclear. One drawing by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]], if to scale, would have made Thangorodrim 35,000&nbsp;ft high, and the statement that it lay 150 leagues (450 [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] miles) north of [[Menegroth]] puts it too far away for some of the action in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' to make sense; a distance of 150–200 miles would have been more consistent. It is possible that with the higher figure Tolkien was not referring to 'as the eagle flies', but rather 'as the wolf runs': the plateau of [[Dorthonion]] forced a long detour which added the extra 200, 250 miles to the distance.<ref>[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] (1991), ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]''</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Thangorodrim'' is [[Sindarin]] for \"Mountains of Tyranny\"<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, p. 116</ref> or \"mountain-chain of tyranny\".<ref>{{HM|UI}}, p. 230</ref> The name consists of ''[[thang]]'' (\"compulsion, oppression\") + ''[[orodrim]]'' (\"mountain-chain\").<ref name=PE17/><ref>[http://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/compound_sindarin_names Compound Sindarin Names in Middle-earth] at [http://www.tolkiendil.com Tolkiendil.com] (accessed 14 July 2011)</ref>\n\nIn earlier [[Noldorin]], ''Thangorodrim'' is glossed as \"Mountains of Duress\".<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry \"[[STAG]]\"</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''1995-8: ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]'':'''\n:The \"Remains of Thangorodrim\" is an [[Under-deeps]] site (conceived as having been drowned in the ocean during the War of Wrath, but surviving as ruins).
