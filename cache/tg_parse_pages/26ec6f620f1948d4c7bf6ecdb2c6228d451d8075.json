''Hithaeglir''</ref>) was a great mountain range that lay between [[Eriador]] in the west and the Great River [[Anduin]] in the east. \n\n==Geographic features==\nIn the far north, the Misty Mountains met the [[Grey Mountains]] and the [[Mountains of Angmar]], forming a '''T'''; The Mountains of Angmar comprising the western \"arm\", the Grey Mountains the Eastern \"arm\", and the Misty Mountains the stem.<ref name=map/> They ran 900 miles (1,448 kilometres)<ref>[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]], ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'', Regional maps, \"The Misty Mountains\"</ref> to the [[Gap of Rohan]] in the south, where they approached the [[White Mountains]]. The Gap was a valley between the southernmost peak of the Misty Mountains and the northernmost of the White Mountains, creating an important pass.<ref group=\"note\">[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] estimates in the ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'' that some of the peaks may have been as high as 12,000 feet (3,660 meters), comparable to the Alps in Europe. Tolkien had visited the Alps in his youth and was greatly impressed by them.</ref>\n\nThe lands around the Misty Mountains included several notable forests, rivers and kingdoms, such as [[Angmar]], [[Eregion]], [[Dunland]], [[Lothlórien]], [[Fangorn]].<ref name=map/> While Elves guarded both sides of the Misty Mountains, few ever crossed over them.\n\n===Important peaks===\nThe northernmost peak of the Misty Mountains can be considered Mount [[Gundabad]],<ref name=map/> where according to legend, [[Durin]], eldest of the seven [[Fathers of the Dwarves]], awoke. Later it became a [[Orc-holds|haven for Orcs]].\n\nThe greatest [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] realm in Middle-Earth, [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], was located at the midpoint of the Misty Mountains. The city was built under three peaks, called the [[Mountains of Moria]]: Redhorn (''[[Caradhras]]'' in Sindarin), Silvertine (''[[Celebdil]]'') and Cloudyhead (''[[Fanuidhol]]'').<ref name=south>{{FR|South}}</ref> Inside Silvertine the Dwarves built the [[Endless Stair]], a stairway from the depths of the mountain to its peak. \n\nThe southernmost mountain was [[Methedras]], which was  Sindarin for \"Last Peak\".<ref name=map>{{FR|Map}}</ref>\n\n===Passes===\n[[Image:Alan Lee - The Pass of Caradhras.jpg|thumb|250px|''The Pass of Caradhras'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]\nThe most important passes were the [[High Pass]] and the [[Redhorn Pass]]. The former was used by [[Bilbo Baggins]] on his way to [[Erebor]], and the latter was used by [[Frodo]], in an attempt to pass over the mountains. There was also a pass at the source of the [[Gladden River]].<ref name=south/>\n\n===Rivers===\n[[File:J.R.R.

Tolkien - The Misty Mountains.jpeg|thumb|Undated painting of the Misty Mountains by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]\nThe Misty Mountains were created by the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Morgoth|Melkor]] during the [[Years of the Trees]] as a hindrance for [[Oromë]], who would hunt his fell creatures. They would later serve as a deterrent for the Elves during the [[Great Journey]], causing some to turn south. The Elves that would not cross the Misty Mountains would become the [[Nandor]].<ref name=s3>{{S|Captivity}}</ref><ref>{{AA|60-2}}, pp. 82-83</ref>\n\n===Inhabitants===\nIt is said that ancient [[bears]] lived in the Mountains until [[Giants]] arrived and the bears left to the lowlands.<ref name=queer>{{H|Queer}}</ref>\n\nThe great Dwarven city of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] (later called the \"Black Pit\" of [[Moria]]) was located near the middle of the mountain chain.  There [[Durin's folk]] lived for thousands of years with a kingdom which spread as far north as Gundabad and as far east as the [[Iron Hills]]. \n\nAt the southern tip of the Misty Mountains, beneath Methedras, was [[Isengard]], which was originally a [[Gondor]]ian fortress but was later given to [[Saruman]].\n\nAround {{TA|1050|n}}, the [[Harfoots]] migrated west across the Misty Mountains, fleeing the ever more numerous Men and the Shadow growing in [[Mirkwood]], thus the [[Hobbits]] entered history. Later the other two groups of Hobbits, the [[Stoors]] and [[Fallohides]], migrated west as well, until by 2500 no Hobbits could be found east of the mountains. \n\nWhen the Dwarves were strong, the mountains were generally free of Orcs, but when the [[Shadow]] was strong, Orcs bred in Mount Gundabad, in [[Goblin-town]], later in Moria itself, and everywhere in between. In {{TA|1300}} the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] started increasing and harassing the [[Dwarves]].<ref name=b2>{{App|B2}}</ref>\n\nThe awakening of [[Durin's Bane]] drove the Dwarves from their city.  It also seems that some Dwarves, either before or after the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]], dwelt on the eastern side of the mountains near Goblin-town. \n\nIn {{TA|2480}} the Orcs began establishing secret strongholds in the Mountains barring all the passes to [[Eriador]] from [[Rhovanion]], while Sauron populated Moria with his creatures.<ref name=b2/>\n\nNear the east exit of Goblin-town the Eagles kept an [[Eagle's Eyrie|eyrie]] to keep watch on the Orcs.<ref name=\"south\"/><ref name=council>{{FR|Council}}</ref> \n\n[[Gandalf]] believed that it was the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] that had driven the people of [[Beorn]] away, and he promised to return there.<ref name=queer/>\n\n[[Thorin and Company]] used the High Pass to cross the Misty Mountains, and witnessed the mysterious [[Giants]]. Later they were captured by the Orcs of Goblin-town.<ref>{{H|Hill}}</ref>\n\nIt seems that Beorn's people returned to the Mountains. Once the Orcs were decimated, the [[Beornings]] kept open the passages of the [[Ford of Carrock]] and the [[High Pass]] in return for tolls.<ref name=council/>\n\nThe [[Fellowship of the Ring]] faced the challenge to pass the Mountains. They decided to avoid the High Pass or the Gap of Rohan because of the threat of Orc patrols and Saruman's forces. They attempted to cross Redhorn Pass, but a powerful blizzard blocked it, forcing them to journey through Moria. There [[Gandalf]] was lost trying to stop Durin's Bane, and after falling into the abyss, he chased him up to the Dwarven [[Endless Stair]] and [[Battle of the Peak|fought on the peak]] of Silvertine.<ref>{{TT|White}}</ref>\n\nIt is said that in the [[Fourth Age]] [[Durin VII]] led the Dwarves back to Moria.<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[Sindarin]] name of the Misty Mountains, '''''hithaeglir''''', consists of ''[[hîth]]'' (\"mist\") and ''aeglir'' (\"line of peaks\").<ref>{{L|180}}</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nIn the [[The Ambarkanta]] [[Ambarkanta maps|maps]] the Misty Mountains are not present, but the [[Great Journey]] map is present. The Misty Mountains would have to be in the North-Lands, between the [[Blue Mountains]] and [[Orocarni|Red Mountains (Orocarni)]].\n\nIn a draft of the chapter ''The Council of Elrond'', the Misty Mountains were also named Hithdilias or Eredhithui<ref>{{TI|C1}} p.124</ref>.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''1967: [[The Hobbit (1967 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1967 film)]]:'''\n:The Misty Mountains are renamed the Barricade Mountains, and encircle Mirkwood, which in turn encircles Dale and the Lonely Mountain.\n\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''\n:The Fellowship decides to take the [[Caradhras|Pass of Caradhras]] over the Misty Mountains after learning that the passage South was being watched. A blizzard caused by Saruman forces the Company to go under the Mountains, through [[Moria]].\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Misty Mountains appear as both a major game region and within other game areas. The region of \"Misty Mountains\" consists of the part of the mountain range adjacent to Rivendell Valley, including both [[High Pass]] and [[Goblin-town]]. The mountain range in a broader sense can also be accessed from other in-game regions, including the pass Caradhras in [[Eregion]], former settlement of Dwarves under [[Thrór]] in eastern [[Enedwaith]], a village on the slopes of mount [[Methedras]] in [[Dunland]], the cliffs of [[Zirakzigil]] in Moria and the eastern slopes of the Mountains in [[Lothlórien]].\n\n'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''\n:While travelling across the Misty Mountains [[Thorin and Company]] are impeded by Stone Giants during a storm. They take refuge in a cave, which leads them to fall into [[Goblin-town]] and are rescued by Gandalf, eventually escaping out onto the East side of the mountain.\n\n{{references|notes}}\n\n[[Category:Misty Mountains]]\n[[Category:Mountain ranges]]\n\n[[de:Nebelgebirge]]\n[[fi:Sumuvuoret]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/reliefs/monts brumeux]]"}}}
