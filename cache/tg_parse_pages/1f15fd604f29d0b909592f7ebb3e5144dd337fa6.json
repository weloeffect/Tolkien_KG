In 2009, [[Soundestiny]] were busily recording a full length album of Hobbit-inspired songs and decided to take a break from the project to finish their [[Winds of Change]] album. Consequently, it was decided to release four of the already-recorded ''Hobbit'' songs as an EP; the full album of songs inspired by [[The Hobbit]] was released in 2012 as [[Dragon Quest]]. The four songs on ''All that Glitters'' are a brief, musical glimpse into [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s magical, fantasy world that later became even more famous with the publication of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n\n== Lineup ==\n*Darryl Grant Potter: vocals, guitar, keyboards, flute\n*Kim Sewell: drums, percussion\n*Elissa Maclean: vocals\n\n== Guests ==\n*Clyde Schipke: guitar\n*Alyssa Marie: vocals on track 1\n\n== Production ==\n*Producers: Kim Sewell and Darryl Grant Potter\n*Engineer: Kim Sewell\n*Arranger: Darryl Grant Potter\n*Artwork: Natalie Camilleri\n\n==Track listing==\n1.
