This is said to be ''\"like a fragment of their song, if it can be like their song without music.\"'' Their powerful singing roused the \"[[Tooks|Tookish]]\" side of [[Bilbo]], and for a moment a desire to explore and adventure came upon him, although the thought of plundering [[dragons]] quickly restored his less adventurous \"[[Baggins]]\" nature.\n\n==Text==\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Far over the misty mountains cold.mp3|thumb|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] reads ''Far over the misty mountains cold'']]\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nFar over the misty mountains cold\nTo dungeons deep and caverns old\nWe must away ere break of day\nTo seek the pale enchanted gold.\n\nThe dwarves of yore made mighty spells,\nWhile hammers fell like ringing bells\nIn places deep, where dark things sleep,\nIn hollow halls beneath the fells.\n\nFor ancient king and elvish lord\nThere many a gleaming golden hoard\nThey shaped and wrought, and light they caught\nTo hide in gems on hilt of sword.\n\nOn silver necklaces they strung\nThe flowering stars, on crowns they hung\nThe dragon-fire, in twisted wire\nThey meshed the light of moon and sun.\n\nFar over the misty mountains cold\nTo dungeons deep and caverns old\nWe must away, ere break of day,\nTo claim our long-forgotten gold.\n\nGoblets they carved there for themselves\nAnd harps of gold; where no man delves\nThere lay they long, and many a song\nWas sung unheard by men or elves.\n\nThe pines were roaring on the height,\nThe winds were moaning in the night.\nThe fire was red, it flaming spread;\nThe trees like torches blazed with light.\n\nThe bells were ringing in the dale\nAnd men looked up with faces pale;\nThen dragon’s ire more fierce than fire\nLaid low their towers and houses frail.\n\nThe mountain smoked beneath the moon;\nThe dwarves, they heard the tramp of doom.\nThey fled their hall, to dying fall\nBeneath his feet, beneath the moon.\n\nFar over the misty mountains grim\nTo dungeons deep and caverns dim\nWe must away, ere break of day,\nTo win our harps and gold from him!\n</poem>\n\n\nLater that night, while Bilbo lay in bed trying to fall asleep, he could still hear Thorin humming in the next room over:\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nFar over the misty mountains cold\nTo dungeons deep and caverns old\nWe must away, ere break of day,\nTo find our long-forgotten gold.\n</poem>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''1977: [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1977 film)]]:'''\n:Parts of the song are sung by the dwarves of Thorin's Company when they meet Bilbo for the first time. They sing it again at Bag End, before Bilbo decides to join them on their quest. Finally, the song is reprised after the death of Smaug, during the dwarves' preparations for the defence of Erebor. The song is the last track on the official soundtrack and is titled \"[[Misty Mountains Cold]]\".\n\n\n'''1985: [[The Hobbit (1985 television film)|''The Hobbit'' (1985 television film)]]'''\n:The song is sang by the dwarves as they are walking through the forest, shortly before being captured by the goblins. Verses 3 through 7 are left out in that version.\n\n\n'''1989: [[Hobit (1989 Slovak radio series)|''Hobit'' (1989 Slovak radio series)]]:'''\n:This radio miniseries adapts the song in a heavily abbreviated version. The dwarves sing it several times throughout the radio play. The lyrics are also more of a loose translation or interpretation of the novel's original lyrics. They do not examine the backstory of the [[Sack of Erebor]] and the dwarves' exile from Erebor in-depth.\n\n'''2001 ''[[Summoning|Let mortal heroes sing your fame (2001 CD)- In hollow halls beneath the fells]]'':'''\n:Black metal tolkien-based band Summoning adapts the song in this title.\n\n'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''\n:A modified version of the song is sung by [[Thorin]] ([[Richard Armitage]]) and the [[Thorin and Company|rest of the Company]] during the unexpected party at [[Bag End]]. [[Neil Finn]] also sings a variation of the song entitled \"[[Song of the Lonely Mountain]]\" in the ending credits of the film.\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4koD_SN7QXA Performed by Clamavi De Profundis]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Erkv1-_xR7U Performed by Geoff Castellucci]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhqfiGLuWaY Über die Nebelberge weit gesammt] ''(Rendition from the late 1970s German radio adaptation of The Hobbit)''\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaMpnl4DrVM Performed by Rachel Hardy]  ''(Abbreviated version, using the lyrics of the 2012 motion picture *The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey*)''\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9dHIcRlsLI The version from the 1985 TV movie]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Poems in The Hobbit]]\n*[[The wind was on the withered heath]]\n\n[[Category:Poems in The Hobbit]]\n[[de:Zweites Lied der Zwerge in Beutelsend]]\n[[fi:Yli sumuisten kylmien vuorten noiden]]"}}}
