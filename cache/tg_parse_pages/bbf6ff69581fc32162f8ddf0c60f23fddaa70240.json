It was one of their primary shipyards, fed with their reckless cutting of trees.<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #69</ref>\n\nWithin a few centuries, the deforestation of the outlying regions [[Enedwaith]] and [[Minhiriath]] became cataclysmic, angering the [[Pre-Númenóreans|local native population]], and they began to fight back with increasing ferocity, destroying the haven several times, and frequently burning the great wood-stores in \"hit-and-run\" attacks.<ref name=\"6d\">{{UT|6d}}</ref>\n\nBy the time of the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]] in the middle of the [[Second Age]], this 'New Haven' had become very well established, and its name had shifted over the intervening one thousand years to '''Lond Daer''', the \"Great Haven\". As such, it was one of the two beachheads of the Númenórean forces in [[Eriador]] that were used to support the [[Elves]] around {{SA|1700}}.<ref>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>\n\nIts shipyards were starved of timber following the war, as the forces of [[Sauron]] had burnt almost all of what remained in Enedwaith and Minhiriath. Once its shipbuilding yards were no longer practicable, it declined in importance, and the Númenórean hunger for ever more wealth shifted focus to the establishment of newer havens to the south, [[Pelargir]] and [[Umbar]]. Following this, the haven was now one of several major ports in Middle-earth, and was known as '''[[Lond Daer Enedh]]''', or \"Great Middle Haven\". Despite this, Númenor still maintained traffic on the [[Gwathló]] as far as the city of [[Tharbad]].<ref name=\"6d\"/><ref group=note>[[Christopher Tolkien]] identifies Vinyalonde with Lond Daer, the different names appearing in different texts. He considers that the new name refers to a much later time, after the building of Pelargir.</ref>\n==Etymology==\n''Vinyalondë'' is [[Quenya]] for \"New Haven\",<ref name=Wife /> clearly a compound of ''[[vinya]]'' (\"new\") + ''[[londë]]'' (\"haven\").\n{{references|n}}\n[[Category:Cities, towns and villages]]\n[[Category:Harbours]]\n[[Category:Quenya locations]]\n[[de:Lond Daer]]\n[[fi:Vinyalondë]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/villes tours et forteresses/eriador/vinyalonde]]"}}}
