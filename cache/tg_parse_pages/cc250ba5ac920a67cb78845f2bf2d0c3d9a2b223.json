Like all the animals in the isle, they were friendly and easy to tame. [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] women were fond of them, and sometimes squirrels lived nearby the houses to visit them.<ref>{{NM|P3xiii}}, pp. 335-6</ref>\n\nIn [[Mirkwood]], the squirrels were black in colour.<ref>{{TT|IV5}}</ref> During their journey through Mirkwood, [[Thorin]] and his company killed a black squirrel for food, but found it to be inedible.<ref>{{H|8}}</ref>\n\n==Nature of the black squirrels==\n[[John D. Rateliff]] has suggested that the black squirrels are \"''dark in coloration''\" (like the other animals the company meet in Mirkwood), \"''no doubt from protective camouflage in a dimly lit environment''\".<ref>{{HM|MB}}, \"VIII. Mirkwood: Text Notes\", p. 317</ref> Henry Gee, discussing the topic of [[Wikipedia:Melanism|melanism]] in [[Middle-earth]], accepts the complexity of the subject (as black creatures often can be said to having been created or used by [[Morgoth]] and [[Sauron]]), but concludes that dark creatures ''per se'' are not \"evil\" in the works of Tolkien: \"''black creatures, whether swans, butterflies or squirrels, are remarkable only inasmuch as there are light-colored forms with which they can be contrasted.''\"<ref>Henry Gee, \"[http://greenbooks.theonering.net/guest/files/081104_01.html Melanism in Middle-earth]\", as of 21 September 2010</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations== \n'''1995: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''\n:Black squirrels are described and given role-playing statistics.
