Mike Campbell and Luke Potter were commissioned during the 1990s to write the supplement. But as the publisher [[Iron Crown Enterprises]] lost the exploitation license to ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'' in September 1999, Campbell and Potter stopped working on the Inland Sea project around 1999/2000.\n\nThe manuscripts of MERP the Inland Sea (including several maps) were in the end published free of charge by [[Chris Seeman]] (from the fanzine [[Other Hands]]). They can be reached through the Yahoo Fan modules web site on Internet (now located at [http://groups.io/g/merp-fan-modules MERP Fan Modules]). The present state of these manuscripts is that of a playable supplement.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://groups.io/g/merp-fan-modules/files/Yahoo%20Groups/MERP%20-%20The%20Inland%20Sea.pdf MERP - The Inland Sea.pdf] (NOTE: registration is free, and you must be a member to access files @ merp-fan-modules)\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Unpublished books]]\n[[Category:MERP]]"}}}
