The inscription in Book XII reads:\n\n:\"''This is the last volume of the work of Christopher Tolkien in which he has collected a great part of all that his father John Ronald Reuel Tolkien wrote of Middle-earth and Valinor. In this book is traced the devising of the history of the later ages in the Northwest of Middle-earth after the [[War of Wrath|Great Battle]] and the Fall of [[Morgoth]].''\"\n\n==From the publisher==\n{{blockquote|The concluding volume of The History of Middle-earth series, which examines the Appendices to The Lord of the Rings.<br>\nThe Peoples of Middle-earth traces the evolution of the Appendices to The Lord of The Rings, which provide a comprehensive historical structure of the Second and Third Ages, including Calendars, Hobbit genealogies and the [[Westron]] language. The book concludes with two unique abandoned stories: [[The New Shadow]], set in Gondor during the Fourth Age, and the [[Tal-Elmar|tale of Tal-Elmar]], in which the coming of the dreaded Númenórean ships is seen through the eyes of men of Middle-earth in the Dark Years.<br>\nWith the publication of this book, the long history of J.R.R.
