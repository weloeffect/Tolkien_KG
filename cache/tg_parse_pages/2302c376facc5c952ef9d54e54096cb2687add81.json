When Ælfwine was nine years old, his father sailed off with his ship [[Éarendel]] and never returned.<ref>{{SD|2d}}</ref>\n\nBecause of the attacks of the [[Wikipedia:Danes|Danes]], his mother fled with him from [[Wikipedia:Somerset|Somerset]], where they lived, to [[Wikipedia:Cornwall|West Wales]], where she had her kindred.\n\nHe was a long way descendant of [[Eärendil]], and had, like all of Eärendil's descendants, [[sea-longing]] in his blood.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}</ref> He was a sailor and a minstrel. \n\nHaving grown up to full manhood and learned the [[Welsh|Welsh language]] and much sea-craft he returned to Somerset to serve King [[Éadweard]]'s [[thain#Etymology|thegn]] [[Odda]] in the wars. In the service of Odda he sailed and visited both [[Wikipedia:Wales|Wales]] and [[Ireland]] many times. On his journeys he always sought tales of the sea, and thus came to hear the Irish legends of [[Wikipedia:The Voyage of Máel Dúin|Maelduin]] and [[Saint Brendan]], who both set out to sea, and came to \"many islands in succession, where they encountered marvel upon marvel\".<ref>{{HM|LR}}</ref> He heard also of a great land in the west which had been cast down. The survivors of the disaster had settled on Ireland and dwindled there; and the successors of these men all had the sea-longing in their blood, so that many sailed off west and never returned. Ælfwine thought he might be one of these descendants.\n\nAround the year [[Seventh Age 914|914 AD]], in autumn, the Danes attacked [[Wikipedia:Porlock|Porlock]]. They were at first driven off and Ælfwine's company managed to capture a Danish [[Wikipedia:Knarr|cnearr]] at night. At dawn Ælfwine told his closest friend, [[Tréowine]], he intended to sail off westward, perhaps to the country of the legendary king [[Wikipedia:Sceafa|Sheaf]]. Tréowine agreed to accompany him at least as far as to Ireland. They got two other companions: [[Ceola]] of Somerset and [[Geraint]] of West Wales.\n[[File:Janet Georgiou - Ælfwine glimpses Valinor.jpg|thumb|left|\"Ælfwine glimpses Valinor\" by [[:Category:Images by Janet Georgiou|Janet Georgiou]]]]\nMany days after they passed Ireland the voyagers were exhausted. A \"dreamlike death\" seemed to come over them, and soon they passed out. The last that is known of the journey is that Tréowine saw the world plunge down under them, while sailing the [[Straight Road]].\n\nWhen Ælfwine woke up, he found himself lying on a beach of [[Tol Eressëa]] and a group of [[Elves]] pulling up his ship on the shore. He came to [[Tavrobel]], where lived [[Pengolodh]] who told him the [[Ainulindalë]],<ref>{{HM|MR}}</ref> and he was shown the ''[[Lammas]]'',<ref>{{LR|Lhammas}}</ref> the ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', the [[Golden Book]],<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}</ref> the ''[[Narn i Chîn Húrin (tale)|Narn i Chîn Húrin]]'',<ref>{{WJ|Aelfwine}}</ref> and the [[The Annals of Aman|Annals of Aman]] and [[Annals of Beleriand|Beleriand]]. \n\nÆlfwine learned much of this lore. When he returned to England, he translated the Silmarillion, the Annals and the ''Narn'' into Old English, giving explanations on the many names.\n\nDescendants of Ælfwine of the present time [[Atlantis-haunting|experienced memories or visions]] of their ancestors around the [[Downfall of Númenor|fall]] of [[Númenor#Inspiration|Atlantis]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''Ælfwine'' simply means \"[[Elf-friend]]\" in [[Old English]],<ref>{{SD|66}}, p. 235</ref><ref>{{HM|N}}, entry '''Elf-friend''', p. 756</ref> and is the equivalent of the names ''[[Elendil]]'' and of course ''[[Elfwine]]''. It is possibly intended as a cognate of ''[[Alboin]]'' and ''[[Alwin Lowdham|Alwin]]''.\n\n== Other names ==\n{{stub}}\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | ELE |ELE=[[Elendil]]<br/><small>''{{SA|3119}} - {{SA|3441|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree | |:| |}}\n{{familytree | |:| |}}\n{{familytree | |:| |}}\n{{familytree | OSW |OSW=[[Óswine (grandfather of Ælfwine)|Óswine]]<br/><small>''fl.

Ælfwine is a later version of a figure Tolkien first named as [[Ottor Wǽfre]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. Ælfwine/Eriol acquired lore from the Elves of Eressea, or translated existing Elvish works into [[Old English]]. Ælfwine is described as hailing from the north-west of England and his texts are in Tolkien's favourite dialect, the Mercian, a dialect which extended as far north as the Ribble Valley in Lancashire. \n\nAs a literary device, Ælfwine/Eriol was intended as an in-universe explanation about the origin of the [[legendarium]]. On the other hand, ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' suggests that [[Bilbo Baggins]] is the originator of the narratives, through his [[Red Book]] and his [[Translations from the Elvish]] which he compiled in [[Rivendell]] (which supposedly included Elvish lore including the ''Ainulindale'' and the ''Quenta Silmarillion''). Ælfwine, or the idea of any real-world narrator or chronicler, may have been eventually abandoned in favor of this style of \"in-character\" narration by Bilbo and his role in the legendarium; even the name \"Elf-friend\" was given directly to him by [[Thranduil|King Thranduil]].\n\nStill, in some of the writings of Tolkien written after ''The Lord of the Rings'', Ælfwine is still referred to and it is hinted that he may not have fully abandoned the idea of Ælfwine's translations, since the two frameworks (Red Book of Westmarch and Ælfwine) are not necessarily mutually exclusive.\n\nChristopher Tolkien decided to remove all references of Ælfwine while compiling ''The Silmarillion'' since it could make the work too complex or complicated. However traces of Ælfwine's 'translations' remain, such as the archaic English 'translations' \"[[Mickleburg]]\" and \"[[Nogrod|Hollowbold]]\".\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Eriol]]\n*[[Alwin Arundel Lowdham]]\n*[[Alboin|Alboin Errol]]\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://youtu.be/QlSkzCpEAsA Video on the History of Ælfwine] by [http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoV0XB2O-7saKLxGqvSOIPw/about Ælfwine's Road on YouTube]\n*''[http://www.forodrim.org/gobennas/chron_en.html The Chroniclers of Arda]'' by [[Måns Björkman]]\n\n{{references|notes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aelfwine}}\n\n[[Category:Anglo-Saxons]]\n[[Category:Characters from the later Ages]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Chroniclers of Arda]]\n[[Category:The Lost Road]]\n[[Category:Mariners]]\n[[Category:The Notion Club Papers]]\n[[Category:Old English names]]\n[[de:Ælfwine]]\n[[fi:Ælfwine]]"}}}
