It was first released in December [[2002]]. The latest version, Dragon Flame 2.0 for Windows, was from December [[2003]], and Dragon Flame 2.0.1 for Linux from July [[2004]].\n\nThomas Deniau contributed a complete rewrite for Mac OS systems in [[2004]], under the name '''Hesperides'''.\n\nBoth software were distributed with their source code, under the terms of the [https://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-2.0 GNU General Public License].\n\nIt should be noted that much material has been published since then. Dragon Flame and Hesperides both embed fairly old versions of the Sindarin lexicon (respectively v0.993 from 2003 and v0.994 from 2004) and were not updated. The authors have no plans of releasing new versions of these programs and do not recommend relying on them for any serious work.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/index.html Dragon Flame for Windows and Linux]\n* [https://github.com/thomasdeniau/Hesperides Hesperides for Mac OS]\n\n[[Category:Linguistic websites]]\n[[fi:Hiswelókë's Sindarin dictionary]]"}}}
