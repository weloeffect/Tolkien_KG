It is only in ''[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]'' that he makes a direct appearance.\n\n==History==\nGuilin was lord of one of four kindreds within Nargothrond, and considered among the most noble of name. His folk were notable contributors to the building of deep mansions of Nargothrond, and they resided to its west on the slopes of [[Taur-en-Faroth]], the Hunters' Wold. He had at least two sons, Gelmir and Gwindor, and his children were renown for their valour, being the first chosen for duties such as watchtowers commanders and keepers of the wold. His son Gwindor was born in Nargothrond, and was a childhood playmate of the princess [[Finduilas]], to whom Gwindor became betrothed.<ref name=failivrin>{{LB|1d}}</ref>\n\nAround {{FA|455}}, during the [[Dagor Bragollach]], Guilin lost his son Gelmir. At the subsequent [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] in {{FA|472}}, Gelmir, who had been taken captive, was presented and slain before [[Fingon|Fingon's]] host; Gwindor was present within that host, leading a company from Nargothrond, and this prompted him into a reckless charge where his forces were eventually trapped and Gwindor himself lost.\n\nIn {{FA|490}}, Gwindor, who had been taken captive and managed to escape, returned to Nargothrond, bringing with him a [[Man]] who identified himself as ''[[Túrin|Agarwaen]]''.<ref>{{GA|267}}</ref> Guilin hastened forth on learning of Gwindor's return, and after beholding him, held him in sweet embrace.<ref name=failivrin />\n\nA great feast was then held within Guilin's halls for Gwindor's homecoming. Yet mirth was mixed with tears as Gwindor's long bondage and torment within [[Angband]] had left him crippled, and bent and haggard like an aged mortal, and chilled the laughter that was once in his eyes and lips. During this feast Guilin poured his dear-hoarded mead into a great ancient silver cup that had come from [[Valinor]]; Guilin seldom filled this cup, save in pledge of love to proven friend. At this feast Guilin further offered for ''Agarwaen'' to dwell within his halls, which ''Agarwaen'' accepted. While ''Agarwaen'' resided there, he learned much of lore and the secrets of the lands.<ref name=failivrin />\n\nNothing further of Guilin's fate is known. In {{FA|495}} however, Orodreth and Gwindor perished in the [[Battle of Tumhalad]], and shortly after [[Fall of Nargothrond|Nargothrond fell]].<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Guilin'' is [[Sindarin]], but the meaning is not glossed.<ref>https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-4141555233.html</ref> It was suggested by [[David Salo]] that the second element may be ''[[lind]]'' (“song”).<ref>[[David Salo]], ''[[A Gateway to Sindarin]]'', p. 351</ref>\n\nIn [[Noldorin]] ''guil'' is a phonological change for the word representing \"Gnome\" (ŋōloi [>] gūlī [>] guil); \"guilan\" and \"guilain\" are the genitive and genitive plural forms respectively.<ref>{{PE|13}}</ref>{{rp|117}} Another interpretation is that it may be related to a soft mutation of the element ''cuil'' (\"life, quality of being alive, lifetime\"),<ref name=encyc>https://www.glyphweb.com/arda/g/guilin.php</ref> such as seen in \"[[Dor Firn-i-Guinar]]\".\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| | | GUI | | | |GUI='''GUILIN'''<br /><small>''b. {{FA}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| |,|-|^|-|.| | |}}\n{{familytree| GWI | | GEL | |GWI=[[Gwindor]]<br /><small>''d. {{FA|495}}''</small>|GEL=[[Gelmir (son of Guilin)|Gelmir]]<br /><small>''d. {{FA|472}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn ''[[Turambar and the Foalókë]]'', from ''[[The Book of Lost Tales: Part Two]]'', he appears only indirectly as '''''Duilin''''', the father of ''Flinding'' (Gwindor) and of an ancient house of the Gnomes.<ref>{{LT2|II}}</ref> His name takes the form ''Dhuilin'' when the patronymic is prefixed (ex. \"Flinding son of Duilin\" vs. \"Flinding bo-Dhuilin\"). Instead of dwelling with Guilin, Túrin dwells with [[Galweg]], father of ''Failivrin'' (Finduilas).<ref>{{LT2|IIn}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Lays of Beleriand]]'' he is named ''Fuilin''. When Túrin arrives in Nargothrond, he is immediately known to all as the son of the renowned hero [[Húrin]], to which Fuilin hails him. His people are stated to have built Nargothrond,<ref name=failivrin/> something latter attributed to both the [[Petty-dwarves]] and the [[Dwarves of the Blue Mountains]].\n\n{{references|notes}}\n[[Category:Calaquendi]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Noldor]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n\n[[de:Guilin]]\n[[fi:Guilin]]"}}}
