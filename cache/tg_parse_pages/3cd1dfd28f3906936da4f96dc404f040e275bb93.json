The bulk of the letter was published in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'': \"Prologue, 3 (I: 12).

After the excerpt, the second paragraph of letter 289 follows].''\n\n\"In O[ld] N[orse], ''[[wikipedia:myrkviðr|myrkviðr]]'' is often found, mainly in Eddaic verse as a proper name. The best known examples are ''[[wikipedia:Völundarkviða|Völundarkviða]]'' 'Lay of Wayland' line 2 where swanmaidens are said to fly from the south through Mirkwood (''meyjar flugu sunnan Myrkvið ígegnum''). The legend and the lay are not of ultimately Norse origin, but derived from the area whence the English came. No doubt *''Mircwudu'' would have appeared in it. The other is in ''[[wikipedia:Atlakviða|Atlakviða]]'' ['Lay of Atli'], the long and corrupt lay dealing with the way in which Atli (Ætla, Attila) got the brothers of Guðrún to come and visit him and then murdered them. Among the many gifts and territories that he promised to give them in stanza 5 is mentioned ''hrís þat et mæera es menn Myrkvið kalla'' 'that renowned forest that men call Mirkwood'.\"\n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Letters to Michael George Tolkien|Letters to Michael George Tolkien]]\n{{references}}\n{{title}}\n[[Category:Letters|Tolkien, Michael George (1966-07-29)]]\n[[Category:Letters to Michael George Tolkien]]"}}}
