It stood a little away from the others, and its conical top was flattened.<ref name=\"Knife\">{{FR|Knife}}</ref>\n\nOf old, it formed the boundary between [[Arthedain]] and [[Rhudaur]].\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nThe Weather Hills lay at the centre of [[Arnor]], near the [[East Road]] that split [[Eriador]].<ref>{{RK|Maps}}</ref>\n\nA tower had stood on the hill since the days of [[Elendil]], and he had stored the ''[[Palantíri|palantír]]'' in its chambers. It is said that before the [[War of the Last Alliance]], Elendil stood at the hill watching the hosts of [[Gil-galad]] coming to join his forces.<ref name=Knife />\n\nAfter King [[Eärendur (King of Arnor)|Eärendur]] passed and the kingdom was split in three, all of his sons coveted the hill, or rather the [[Amon Sûl-stone|Stone]] inside. It lay on the exact tri-state point, but eventually passed to [[Arthedain]], the realm of [[Amlaith]], the eldest son of Eärendur, although it already possessed the [[Elostirion-stone|other]] [[Annúminas-stone|two]] Stones.<ref name=\"Eriador\">{{App|Eriador}}</ref>\n\n===Destruction===\n[[File:Fall of Amon Sul RotWK.png|left|thumb|The Fall of Amon Sûl in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'']]\nIn the days of [[Argeleb I|Argeleb]], the royal lines of [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]] had failed. Argeleb therefore claimed both realms as his own, hoping to reunite [[Arnor]], but the claim was resisted by Rhudaur, where the Dúnedain had dwindled and the land was now largely ruled by hillmen, who were driven by the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]].\n\nAs tensions with Angmar increased, Argeleb fortified his border. A great bastion arose on Weathertop, and the East Road and lower Hoarwell were fortified also. For nigh half a century, the line held, though Argeleb lost his life in battle with the Hillmen. The Witch-king did not trouble the Men, and had sent his troops further East, to the [[Second Siege of Imladris]]. But in {{TA|1409}}, he came forth with such a force from Angmar that no army could stop him. He [[Fall of Amon Sûl|razed]] Amon Sûl and brought its mighty walls down.<ref name=\"Eriador\"/> [[Arveleg I|Arveleg]], son of Argeleb, was slain,<ref name=\"TA\">{{App|TA}}</ref> as well as the [[last prince of Cardolan]],<ref>{{HM|RC}}, \"Fog on the Barrow-downs\", pp. 144-5; Index, 'Cardolan, [[Last prince of Cardolan|last prince of]]'</ref> but the Lord of the Nazgûl failed to retrieve the ''palantír''. It was secured and brought back to [[Fornost Erain]].<ref name=\"Eriador\"/>\n\n===In ruins===\n[[File:Alan Lee - Weathertop.jpg|thumb|right|''Weathertop'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]\nFor many centuries, the once great fortress stood in ruins on the hill. The locals paid little heed to it. It faded back into obscurity, and it was not until {{TA|3018}} the hill reappeared in the chronicles and annals. In early October, it was the scene of two fights involving the [[Nazgûl]]; one with [[Gandalf]] on [[3 October|October 3]] and one with [[Frodo Baggins|the Ring-bearer]] [[6 October|three days later]].<ref name=\"Chief\">{{App|Chief}}</ref> Gandalf on [[Shadowfax]] was secretly chased by the Ringwraiths until the night of October 3, when six<ref>{{HM|RC}}, \"Flight to the Ford\", pp. 187-189</ref> or nine<ref>{{HM|RC}}, \"The Council of Elrond\", pp. 251-3</ref> Black Riders, led by the [[Witch King]], attacked him. They were repulsed after a violent fight which burnt the hilltop, and [[Frodo]] and [[Aragorn]] saw the lights of that battle from their camp at the [[Midgewater Marshes]].<ref>{{HM|RC}}, \"A Knife in the Dark\", pp. 167-9</ref> The Witch King and [[Khamûl]] remained watching Weathertop (waiting for the Ring Bearer to come) for two days thereafter, along with three other Wraiths.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, \"A Knife in the Dark\", pp. 169</ref> After fleeing from Bree, [[Aragorn|Strider]] and the [[Travellers|Hobbits]] avoided the main road and approached Weathertop from the north. At the top they discovered a cairn with a message from Gandalf, and spotted the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]] approaching in the distance along the road. That night, the Ringwraiths attacked their camp in a dell below the summit, stabbing [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] with a [[Morgul-knife]], but were driven off by the others.<ref name=\"Knife\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Amon Sul.mp3|Ardamir}}\n\"Weathertop\" is a translation of the [[Sindarin]] ''Amon Sûl'', although it also can be translated as \"Hill of the Wind\", being a combination of ''[[amon]]'' (\"hill\") and ''[[sûl]]'' (\"wind\").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 778</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Weathertop in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:War in Middle Earth - Amon Sûl.png|''[[J.R.R.

The bastion is protected by five mystical Mallorn trees: one generates a solar flare that incinerates enemies, one heals damaged buildings, one creates lush Elvish pastures (that boost the Men's armor and damage), one stuns targeted enemies and one summons a battalion of archers. The mission is completed when either all five mallorns are destroyed, or the tower falls.\n\n:Additionally, two maps of Amon Sûl are available in Skirmish mode: one with the tower, which is identical to the mission save for the Mallorn trees, and one with the tower in ruins and all other buildings removed.\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Weathertop is the most prominent landmark of the [[Lone-lands]] region. After the passing of [[Aragorn]] and the Hobbits, the Ranger Candaith sets up a camp at its foothold, the player later helps him defend the summit of Weathertop against two enemy assaults.\n\n'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''\n:Weathertop is the meeting place between [[Azog]] and his lieutenants. Azog kills [[Yazneg]] for his failue to capture or kill [[Thorin and Company]].\n\n==External links==\n*[http://middle-earth.xenite.org/2013/11/06/how-high-was-weathertop/ How High Was Weathertop?] by [[Michael Martinez]]\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Eriador]]\n[[Category:Hills]]\n[[de:Amon Sûl]]\n[[fi:Amon Sûl]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/reliefs/eriador/amon sul]]"}}}
