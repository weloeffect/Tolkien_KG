They were brought before the Great Goblin, who accused them of spying, and was enraged when he found that Thorin was carrying [[Orcrist]], a sword the Great Goblin remembered from [[Gondolin]]. With the help of [[Gandalf]], the Great Goblin was slain and Bilbo and the Dwarves escaped, pursued by a force of Orcs.<ref>{{H|Hill}}</ref>\n\n== Portrayal in adaptations ==\n'''1977: [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1977 film)]]:'''\n:Goblin-town is, like in the book, a set of tunnels and caverns.\n\n'''1989: [[The Hobbit (comic book)|''The Hobbit'' (comic book)]]:'''\n:Goblin-town is, like in the book, a set of tunnels and caverns.\n\n'''2003: [[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|''The Hobbit'' (2003 video game)]]:'''\n:Goblin-town is a giant Dwarven mining complex with many lifts, bridges and train carts to spice up the action of the level.\n\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Goblin-town.jpg|thumb|250px|Goblin-town in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:One of the first new additions to the game after the initial release, Goblin-town proper is a large network of tunnels and caverns accessible from the eastern part of the [[Misty Mountains]] region. It is a labyrinthine network of hallways, bridges and caves with many side passages. Great Goblin's Throne Room and [[Gollum's lake|Gollum's Cave]] are two of the natural endpoints of the exploration. Goblin-town was revisited in the \"Seat of the Great Goblin\" group instance that greatly streamlined the layout with the focus on the Throne Room. Another version of Goblin-town is accessible from the eastern entrance in the [[Vales of Anduin]] region. This version also contains the Throne Room, with all three versions of it being slightly different from one another.\n\n'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''\n:Goblin-town is portrayed as a giant system of caverns with sprawling wooden walkways. The goblins have a central hub of dwellings, with the Great Goblin's throne being in the center.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Clap!
