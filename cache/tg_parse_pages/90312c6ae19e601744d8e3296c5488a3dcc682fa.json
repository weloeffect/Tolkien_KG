Sharing tenure at Oxford and authorship of fantasy, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] was hastily compared with Carroll by some early reviewers of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref>{{HM|OFS}}, p. 96</ref> The reviewers of ''The Hobbit'' comparing it to the ''Alice'' stories, appear to have \"relied overmuch on the publisher's blurb\",<ref>{{CG|RG}}, p. 398</ref> which stated that:\n\n{{quote|The birth of ''The Hobbit'' recalls very strongly that of ''Alice in Wonderland''. Here again a professor of an abstruse subject is at play.<ref name=L15>{{L|15}}</ref>}}\n\nTolkien offered comments about the \"abstruse subject\" and the comparison with ''Alice in Wonderland'' in his [[Letter 15]]. Concerning the latter point, Tolkien wrote that ''The Hobbit'' \"is more comparable to Dodgson's amateur photography, and his song of Hiawatha's failure<ref group=note>The \"song of Hiawatha's failure\" can be found within Carroll's ''[[Wikipedia:Rhyme? and Reason?|Rhyme? and Reason?]]'', entitled ''Hiawatha's Photographing''.</ref> than to ''Alice''\". He did, however, concede  that \"the compliment to ''The Hobbit'' is rather high\" and, if the comparison is to be maintained, that Carroll's ''Through the Looking-Glass'' \"ought to be mentioned\" as it \"is much closer in every way\".<ref name=L15/>\n\n===On Fairy-Stories===\nAt the beginning of his essay ''[[On Fairy-Stories]]'', Tolkien separates the \"genuine fairy-story\" from other forms of fantastical tales. Literary genres sometimes (but erroneously or carelessly, according to Tolkien) defined as fairy-stories include travellers' tales (e.g., [[Wikipedia:Jonathan Swift|Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Wikipedia:A Voyage to Lilliput|A Voyage to Lilliput]]''), [[Wikipedia:Beast fable|beast-fables]], and dream-stories. Pertaining to the latter, Tolkien names Carroll's ''Alice'' stories, which he describes as \"successful and amusing\". However, the ''Alice'' stories are only an illusion found within the frame of a dream, and do thus not touch on the notion of [[Faerie#Inspiration|Faërie]] — the primary and defining characteristic of the fairy-story.<ref>{{HM|OFS}}, pp. 32-37</ref><ref>{{CG|RG}}, p. 684</ref>\n\n===Other mentions===\nWorking for the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', Tolkien suggested \"''for future addition ... at least a quotation from'' [[Wikipedia:Sylvie and Bruno|Sylvie and Bruno]] ''by Lewis Carroll, illustrating the word smirkle''\".<ref>{{CG|RG}}, p. 727</ref>\n\n[[Christina Scull]] and [[Wayne G. Hammond]] have noted that Tolkien:\n{{quote|...was amused by Lewis Carroll's ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' (1865) and ''Through the Looking Glass'' (1872); later in his life he was also fond of Carroll's ''Sylvie and Bruno'' (1889) and ''Sylvie and Bruno Concluded'' (1893), and occasionally recited verses from them.<ref>{{CG|RG}}, p. 815</ref>}}\n\nTolkien's friend [[Roger Lancelyn Green]] was founder of the Lewis Carroll Society, and edited and wrote an introduction for ''The Works of Lewis Carroll'' (1965).\n\n[[John D. Rateliff]] has suggested that Tolkien's creation of the word [[The Book of Ishness|''ishness'']] might have been inspired by a passage in chapter 7 of ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'': \"did you ever see a thing as a drawing of a muchness!\".<ref>{{HM|AI}}, p. 65 (note 13)</ref>\n\nTolkien once wrote a translation [[Wikipedia:Jabberwocky|Jabberwocky]] into [[Old English]] which he had entitled as ''[[Bealuwérig]]''.<ref name=collectedpoems>{{CP|A5}}</ref>\n\n==External links==\n*{{WP|Lewis Carroll}}\n\n{{references|n}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carroll, Lewis}}\n\n[[Category:Authors]]\n[[Category:British people]]\n[[Category:People by name]]"}}}
