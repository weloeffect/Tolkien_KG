The upper part of the North Undeep also bordered the [[Field of Celebrant]] and was where the [[Limlight]] joined the Great River.<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref> Both of the Undeeps had many shallows and wide shoals that afforded an easy crossing for an army.<ref>{{UT|6c}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn {{TA|1899}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> messengers from [[Marhwini]] of the [[Northmen]] warned King [[Calimehtar (King of Gondor)|Calimehtar]] of [[Gondor]] that the [[Wainriders]] were plotting to invade [[Calenardhon]] by crossing the Undeeps. The messengers also revealed that Northmen previously enslaved by the Wainriders were preparing to revolt if war broke out. Calimehtar soon led an army north from [[Ithilien]], which drew the Wainriders towards him. The king feigned to withdraw to the [[Dagorlad]] where he engaged the enemy. As the battle raged cavalry from Gondor crossed the Undeeps, joined with Marhwini, and struck the Wainriders in the flank and rear. One third of the Wainriders died and the rest were harried northward by Marhwini's riders.<ref name=\"Northmen\">{{UT|Northmen}}</ref>\n\nDuring the reign of King [[Ondoher]] the Wainriders were still a deadly threat, but forts along the Anduin north of [[Sarn Gebir]] were sufficiently manned to prevent any incursion across the Undeeps.<ref name=\"Northmen\"/>\n\nAs time wore on the river forts were neglected during the [[Watchful Peace]]. When [[Cirion]] became the [[Ruling Steward]] of Gondor he was aware of the danger in the north and established a few men in the old forts to watch the Undeeps. Spies were sent into the east and soon Cirion learned that the [[Balchoth]] were mustering south of [[Mirkwood]]. In {{TA|2510|n}} Cirion sent riders to seek aid from the [[Éothéod]], the descendants of Marhwini's Northmen, and then led what strength he could north into Calenardhon. The Balchoth drove the army of Gondor north over the Limlight; Cirion's force were then assailed by [[Orcs]] who had descended from the [[Misty Mountains]].\n\nSuddenly [[Eorl]] the Young, having received the summons, arrived and saved the men of Gondor. They had crossed the Undeeps and the Limlight, and then charged the enemy's rear.<ref>{{UT|Ride}}</ref>\n\nAfter victory at the [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant]], Cirion granted the land of Calenardhon to Eorl and the Éothéod. The Undeeps then became part of the border of the new realm of [[Rohan]].<ref>{{UT|Eorl}}</ref>\n\nIn [[February]] {{TA|3019|n}} the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] rode boats down the Anduin and traversed the Undeeps on their journey to the south. On [[11 March]] eastern Rohan was invaded from the north, with the invaders crossing at the Undeeps. Their stay was short-lived; the [[Ents]] defeated them the next day.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''\n: The Undeeps (the Northern and the Southern) of Anduin have an average water depth of 4 feet.
