It was then that two [[Elves]] came to King [[Orodreth]]: [[Gelmir (messenger of Círdan)|Gelmir]] and [[Arminas]] they were who had journeyed long from [[Círdan]] at the [[Mouths of Sirion]] who sent message from [[Ulmo]]; for the Lord of Waters had said peril draws near to Nargothrond. ''Shut your [[Doors of Felagund|doors]]'' he had bidden and ''cast down [[Bridge of Nargothrond|Narog's bridge]]''. \n\nBut Orodreth turned to [[Túrin]] [[Mormegil]] for counsel, who in his pride would not heed the words sent from Círdan, who, Túrin said, hid from wars in the furthest place of [[Beleriand]], far from the shadow of [[Morgoth]].\n[[File:Alan Lee - Fall of Nargothrond.jpg|left|thumb|''The Fall of Nargothrond'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]\nNow autumn came, and indeed Morgoth unleashed a great horde long prepared and at its head was [[Glaurung]], [[Father of Dragons]]. In the northern vale of [[Sirion]] was [[Eithel Ivrin]] defiled and the [[Talath Dirnen|Guarded Plain]], [[Talath Dirnen]] was burned. There came Túrin and Ordoreth, ahead a host of Nargothrond, but the multitude from [[Angband]] was greater and none but Túrin guarded by his dwarf-mask could withstand the dragon.\n\nThe soldiers of Nargothrond were withered and beaten; and Gwindor in death said, ''\"Haste to Nargothrond and save [[Finduilas]]\"''. But Túrin came too late, for Glaurung and a host of [[Orcs]] were before him, and the [[Bridge of Nargothrond|bridge over the Narog]] proved a ruin for they came upon the Doors in force and all the halls were taken and ruined.\n\nIn that sack, Túrin came to the wrecked [[Doors of Felagund]] and Glaurung awaited him, so that Túrin was bewitched by the dragon's eye. There Túrin stood as stone as Finduilas amongst the thralls were led away to torment in Angband by a horde of Orcs. And Glaurung held [[Húrin]]'s son to wound him with the cries of those innocents so they would trouble him thereafter.\n\nWith the passing of that dreadful company, Túrin was loosened; but once more Glaurung taunted him, and seemingly released him in pity. As he gave Túrin his freedom, he said to hasten to [[Dor-lómin]] to his mother and sister, and not tarry with the fate of Finduilas.\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fall of Nargothrond}}\n[[Category:The Children of Húrin chapters]]\n[[fi:Nargothrondin tuho (HLT)]]"}}}
