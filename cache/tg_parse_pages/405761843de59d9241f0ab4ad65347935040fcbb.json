Duinhir is absolutely broken when both of his sons die during the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] but nevertheless joins the march of the Host of the West towards the [[Black Gate]]. Upon entering the [[Dagorlad]], his will fails completely and he becomes one of the faint-hearted, men who leave the main host with [[Aragorn]]'s permission. Duinhir then leads those men towards [[Cair Andros]], where they liberate the island from the forces of [[Mordor]].\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Gondorians]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n\n[[de:Duinhir]]\n[[fi:Duinhir]]\n[[fr:encyclo:personnages:hommes:3a:dunedain:gondoriens:duinhir]]"}}}
