This scene was extended in the latter edition.\n\n==Synopsis==\nAs [[Treebeard]] talks with [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] about a family of field mice who used to ''\"tickle him awfully\"'', the two [[Hobbits]] stare at the desolation of south [[Fangorn Forest|Fangorn]]. Treebeard stops short and stares as he sees that much of the greenery surrounding [[Isengard]] has been destroyed. He mourns for the loss of the trees, saying ''\"Many of these trees were my friends. Creatures I had known from nut and acorn. They had voices of their own.\"'' While Merry looks around and Pippin tries to comfort him, Treebeard's gaze falls upon Isengard, and he says in anger, ''\"[[Saruman]]. A [[Wizards|wizard]] should know better!\"''\n\nHe summons [[Ents]] and [[Huorns]] out of Fangorn Forest with a great cry. Pippin notices that trees in the distance are moving. Treebeard says that their business is with the [[Orcs]], but that his business is with Isengard. A host of Ents emerges from the forest to join him, and they begin their approach to Isengard; Treebeard remarks to the two Hobbits that this could be their doom, and that it is likely to be the last march of the Ents. \n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers scenes|56]]"}}}
