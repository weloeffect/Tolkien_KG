Years later, Thráin too set out into Middle-earth, seeking to recover Erebor himself, and taking with him the Map to guide his way. He was captured in the Wild by the servants of [[Sauron]], but Sauron captured Thráin for one of the [[Seven Rings|Seven]] [[Rings of Power]] he bore, and so overlooked the Map he carried too. This proved to be a serious oversight, because [[Gandalf]] secretly entered Sauron's lair at [[Dol Guldur]] while Thráin was a prisoner there, and managed to escape with the Map and the key that opened the secret door.<ref name=Party>{{H|1}}</ref>\n\nUsing Thrór's Map, his grandson [[Thorin]] was able to lead [[Thorin and Company|a small group of Dwarves]] (and one [[Hobbits|Hobbit]], a certain [[Bilbo Baggins]]) on his own quest to refound the ancient Dwarf-realm.<ref name=Party /> Through many adventures, they were able to recover Erebor and bring about the destruction of Smaug, dealing Sauron a serious reverse.<ref>{{H|14}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\nAs was traditional among the [[Dwarves]], it was drawn with East at the top of the map and showed the [[Lonely Mountain]] of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], the [[River Running|Running]] River that flowed from it, and the lands about. It also contained mention of a [[Back Door|secret entrance]] to the Mountain, and (written in secret [[Moon-letters]]) instructions as to how it might be opened.\n\nThe Map's Runes are written in Anglo-Saxon [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_runes Futhorc] however it is spelt out in modern English, not in [[Khuzdul]].\nThe small text on the left, below the hand, reads.\n\nfive<br>\nfeet high<br>\nthe door an<br>\nd three may<br>\nwalk abre<br>\nast.<br>\nTh.
