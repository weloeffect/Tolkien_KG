The Dwarves passed over the [[Blue Mountains]] into Beleriand and established the cities [[Nogrod]] and [[Belegost]]. They came in contact with the [[Sindar]] and a friendship grew between the two races. [[Melian]], having the foresight of the [[Maiar]], advised [[Thingol]] that the peace of [[Arda]] would not last forever. Thus, Thingol set out to build a strong dwelling for himself and his people in case evil would awaken again in [[Middle-earth]]. Together with the Dwarves, they built [[Menegroth]], the Thousand Caves.<ref name=\"Sindar\" /> \n\nLater the Dwarves came to Thingol and told him of the sighting of evil creatures roaming far and wide in [[Beleriand]], learning the ways of the land and awaiting the return of their lord. Thingol then ordered his people to be armed and the Dwarves smithied weapons and armour for the Elves. Together they drove out the evil creatures, and for a time there was peace.<ref name=\"Sindar\" /> \n\nEast of the Blue Mountains in [[Eriador]] dwelt some of the [[Nandor]] that wandered around the [[Anduin]]. They were troubled by the fell beasts of the north so [[Denethor (son of Lenwë)|Denethor]], son of [[Lenwë]], led much of the Nandor west across the Blue Mountains after hearing rumour of the might of Thingol's realm. Thingol welcomed them as long lost kin and they dwelt in [[Ossiriand]].<ref name=\"Sindar\" /> \n\nAfter Melkor served three ages of imprisonment, he was released, but soon turned to evil again, and destroyed the [[Two Trees]] with the aid of [[Ungoliant]]. While the [[Noldor]] still toiled through [[Araman]] Morgoth had returned to Middle-earth with the [[Silmarils]] and rebuilt his old fortress of [[Angband]].\n\n==History==\n===Prelude===\nShortly before the [[Return of the Noldor]] to Middle-earth, Morgoth launched his attack upon Beleriand, thinking to gain the mastery of the land quickly. The Orcs had long been breeding and multiplying and Morgoth filled them with purpose. From the gates of Angband issued a great army, it broke into two hosts which passed west between [[Sirion]] and [[Narog]] and east between [[Celon]] and [[Gelion]].<ref name=\"Sindar\" /> Some of the bands even climbed the passes of [[Anach]] and [[Aglon]], for the [[Orcs]] were said to have \"passed silently into the highlands of the north.\"<ref name=\"Sindar\" />\n\n===Battle===\nIn [[West Beleriand]], the bulk of the western host camped on the plain between Narog and Sirion, hurrying throughout West Beleriand; and Thingol was cut off from Círdan at [[Eglarest]].<ref name=\"Sindar\" /> Led by Círdan, the [[Elves of the Havens]] countered but were driven back within their walls and besieged.<ref name=\"Sindar\" />\n\nIn East Beleriand, King Thingol took the offensive, leading out the Sindar of Menegroth and the Forest of [[Region]].<ref name=\"Sindar\" /> He called upon Denethor who led a host of Elves from Ossiriand. The eastern host of Orcs were assailed on both its sides by the Eldar and a battle ensued north of the [[Andram]]. The [[Orcs]] prevailed over Denethor and encircled him on [[Amon Ereb]], where he fell before he could be rescued by Thingol's host, for the lightly-armed [[Elves of Ossiriand]] were no match for the iron-clad and heavily-armed Orcs.<ref name=\"Sindar\" /> When help arrived, the Elves routed the Orcs of Morgoth and of the few Orcs who escaped, most fell later to the axes of the [[Dwarves of the Blue Mountains|Dwarves of Mount Dolmed]].<ref name=\"Sindar\" />  \n\n===Aftermath===\n[[File:Steamey - Making the Girdle of Melian.jpg|250px|right|thumb|\"Making the Girdle of Melian\" by [[:Category:Images by Steamey|Steamey]]]]\nThe western host overran West Beleriand and the [[Falas]], while the eastern host of [[Morgoth]] was destroyed.<ref name=\"Sindar\" />\n\nAfter the battle, Thingol withdrew his people into [[Neldoreth]] and Region, and Melian used her power to encircle this dominion with an invisible wall of shadows and bewilderment known as the [[Girdle of Melian]].<ref name=\"Sindar\" />  The land of [[Eglador]] was thereafter called [[Doriath]], the Guarded Realm.<ref name=\"Sindar\" /> The Orcs of Morgoth remained free to wander Beleriand, except in the [[Falas]] and Doriath.<ref name=\"Sindar\" />\n\nThe death of Denethor in this battle led the Elves of Ossiriand to pledge to never again name a king or participate in the wars between other Elves and Morgoth.<ref name=\"Sindar\" /> After that time, many of Denethor's people left Ossiriand for the guarded forests of Doriath: these settled in [[Arthórien]] and became known as the [[Guest-elves]], others merged with the [[Sindar]].<ref name=\"Sindar\"/><ref name=UT>{{UT|2d}}</ref><ref name=WJP1>{{WJ|P1}}, pp. 112-3</ref> Those few that remained took up a secretive existence, camouflaging themselves in green. From that time on, they were known as the [[Laiquendi]], the Green-elves.<ref name=\"Sindar\" />\n\nThe [[Havens of the Falas]] were besieged for a few months until the Return of the Noldor forced the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]] and the Orcs withdrew to fight the Noldor under [[Fëanor]] (which occurred shortly after).<ref name=\"S|Return\">{{S|Return}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nAn early description of the battle first appears in ''[[The Earliest Annals of Valinor]]'', though it was pencilled hastily later on the manuscript.<ref>{{SM|2}}</ref> In the later development of the story it is part of ''[[The Later Annals of Valinor]]'' and ''[[Quenta Silmarillion (Lost Road)|Quenta Silmarillion]]''.<ref>{{LR|P2VI}}</ref> \n\nThe battle was never considered to be one of the 'major battles' in the [[Wars of Beleriand]] until later it was mentioned as so in ''[[The Grey Annals]]''.<ref>{{GA|38}}</ref> The first [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath|encounter between the Orcs and Noldor]] in Beleriand was originally considered to be the 'First Battle of Beleriand', however, Tolkien seems to have changed this idea overtime and had Morgoth's battle with the Sindar in Beleriand, before the Return of the Noldor, as the 'First Battle' which would retroactively move the Dagor-nuin-Giliath (Battle-under-Stars) as the second battle.<ref>{{GA|36|note}}</ref> It is unclear whether Tolkien was considering having a name for the new 'First Battle' or overlooked it but it is notable that an alternative name is absent when compared to the other battles. In ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' Christopher simply left it as it is.\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{warsofbeleriand}}\n\n[[Category:Conflicts of the First Age]]\n[[Category:Sieges]]\n[[de:Erste große Schlacht von Beleriand]]\n[[fr:encyclo/evenements/aa/guerres/premiere bataille de beleriand]]\n[[fi:Beleriandin Sotien ensimmäinen taistelu]]"}}}
