It is said that she could speak with birds.\n\n==History==\nShe was named Elwing, \"which is Star-spray, for she was born on a night of stars, whose light glittered in the spray of the waterfall of [[Lanthir Lamath]] beside her father's house.\"<ref name=\"Doriath\">{{S|22}}</ref>\n\nWhen Elwing was very young, her father Dior inherited the throne of [[Doriath]], along with the [[Silmaril]] reclaimed by her renowned grandfather [[Beren]], a [[Men|Man]] of the [[Edain]]. Then she and her twin-brothers, Eluréd and Elurín, moved with their parents, Dior and Nimloth, to the caves of [[Menegroth]] in Doriath. In {{FA|506}}, the [[sons of Fëanor]], driven by their terrible [[Oath of Fëanor|Oath]], [[Second Kinslaying|attacked Menegroth]] and slew her parents (the King and Queen of Doriath) and took her elder brothers in captivity to starve in the wild. She escaped the [[Second Kinslaying]] with the Silmaril and fled to the [[Havens of Sirion]].<ref name=\"Doriath\" /> There she met and married [[Eärendil]] and gave birth to twins [[Elrond]] and [[Elros]].\n[[File:Elena Kukanova - The Seagull.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''The Seagull'' by [[Elena Kukanova]]]]\nIn {{FA|538}} the remaining sons of Fëanor attacked the Havens of Sirion to reclaim the Silmaril in her possession. They captured Elwing's sons but as they came for her she cast herself into the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]].\n\nThrough the power of the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Ulmo]], she took the form of a white bird and came to her husband in his ship [[Vingilótë]] with the Silmaril upon her breast.<ref name=\"Earendil\">{{S|24}}</ref>\n\nElwing sailed with her husband on his great voyage to the [[Aman|West]] and, unlike the crew of his ship, refused to be separated from him when he sought the [[Valar]] in [[Valinor]]. While he spoke to them, she went to [[Alqualondë]] and told the [[Falmari]] (who, as [[Teleri]], were of Thingol's kin) there about the tumultuous history of [[Beleriand]], and later persuaded them to sail their ships for the [[Host of Valinor]]. When the Valar allowed Eärendil and Elwing, both being Half-elven, to choose which of the races they would be members of, Eärendil let her make the choice for them. Because of what had happened to her grandmother [[Lúthien]], Elwing decided to be counted among the Elves, as did her husband for her sake. \n[[File:Roger Garland - Earendil and Elwing.jpeg|200px|thumb|right|''Earendil and Elwing'' by [[Roger Garland]]]]\nElwing was given a white [[Elwing's tower|tower]] northward upon the borders of the [[Sundering Seas]], and there she helped seabirds that came to her windows. Eventually she learned their language, and was able to fly with white wings, and she still flies to meet Eärendil whenever he returns from his voyages through the sky. \"Then the far-sighted among the Elves that dwelt in the Lonely Isle would see her like a white bird, shining, rose-stained in the sunset, as she soared in joy to greet the coming of Vingilot to haven.\"<ref name=\"Earendil\">{{S|24}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Elwing'' means \"Star-spray\" in [[Sindarin]], composed of ''[[êl]]'' (\"star\") + ''[[wing]]'' (\"foam, spray\").<ref>{{S|Index}}, entry ''Elwing''</ref><ref>{{PM|XI4}}, pp. 349</ref><ref>{{PM|Ros}}, pp. 369-70</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | ELU |y| MEL | | BEO | | | |ELU=[[Thingol|Elu Thingol]]|MEL=[[Melian]]|BEO=[[Bëor]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | |!| | | | | |:| | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | LUT |~|y|~| BER | | | |LUT=[[Lúthien]]|BER=[[Beren]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | DIO |y| NIM | | |DIO=[[Dior|Dior Eluchíl]]|NIM=[[Nimloth of Doriath|Nimloth]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree | EAR |y| ELW | | ELD | | ELN |EAR=[[Eärendil]]|ELW='''ELWING'''|ELD=[[Eluréd]]|ELN=[[Elurín]]}}\n{{familytree | |,|-|^|-|.| | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | ELR | | ELS | | | | | | | | |ELR=[[Elrond]]|ELS=[[Elros]]}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Gnomish names]]\n[[Category:Half-elven]]\n[[Category:Noldorin names]]\n[[Category:Sindar]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n\n[[de:Elwing]]\n[[fi:Elwing]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/elfes/semi-elfes/elwing]]"}}}
