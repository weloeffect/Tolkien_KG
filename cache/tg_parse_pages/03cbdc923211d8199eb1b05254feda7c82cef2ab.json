Their capital was [[Ost-in-Edhil]] ({{SA|750}}<ref>{{App|B1}}</ref>).\n\nNoldor and [[Dwarves of Khazad-dûm|Dwarves]] cooperated for about a thousand years, and their rare friendship was the closest between [[Elves]] and [[Dwarves]] in history. Celebrimbor helped to construct the famous and magical [[Doors of Durin|West-gate of Moria]]. The Gwaith were said to be the most talented artisans to have worked since the time of [[Fëanor]] himself (who was Celebrimbor's grandfather). \n\n[[Sauron]], after failing with [[Gil-galad]] and [[Elrond]], targeted the Gwaith. In the guise of [[Annatar]] the \"Lord of Gifts\" in {{SA|1200}} he presented himself as an agent of the [[Valar]] and taught them how to forge the [[Rings of Power]]. The Gwaith were easily tempted since they wanted to bring to [[Middle-earth]] the joys of Valinor.<ref>{{S|V}}</ref><ref name=\"L\">{{L|131}}</ref> The Rings would prevent or slow the decay of the mortal world, preserve what was desired or loved and also enhance the natural powers of a possessor even if that would mean disrupting the natural course of the mortal world.<ref name=\"L\"/><ref>{{L|181}}</ref><ref>{{L|154}}</ref>\n\nThe Gwaith together with \"Annatar\" made several rings in {{SA|1500}}. Because of their friendship with the Dwarves, Celebrimbor presented King [[Durin III]] with [[Ring of Thrór|a Ring of Power]].<ref>{{App|A3}}</ref> When Annatar had left (actually for [[Mordor]]) about {{SA|1590}} Celebrimbor made the [[Three Rings]]<ref>{{FR|I2}}</ref> partly using the teachings of \"Annatar\".\n\nThen Sauron betrayed them and forged [[the One Ring]]. However, the Gwaith realized his plan and denied to hand him their Rings, resulting in the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]]. Eregion was devastated in {{SA|1697}} and the survivors of the Gwaith followed [[Elrond]] and retreated to [[Rivendell]].\n\n==Etymology==\n''Gwaith-i-Mírdain'' means \"Brotherhood of Jewel-smiths\" in [[Sindarin]] (from ''[[gwaith]]'' = \"host, people\" and ''[[mírdain]]'' = \"jewel-smiths\").\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gwaith-i-Mirdain}}\n\n[[Category:Organizations]]\n[[Category:Sindarin demonyms]]\n[[Category:Smiths]]\n[[de:Gwaith-i-Mírdain]]\n[[fr:encyclo:personnages:elfes:noldor:gwaith-i-mirdain]]\n[[fi:Gwaith-i-Mírdain]]"}}}
