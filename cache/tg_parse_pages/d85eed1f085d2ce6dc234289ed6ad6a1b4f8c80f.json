Hooker]]. It refers to the lexicological study of place and person's names derived from first world languages.\n\n==Overview==\nAs a sub section of [[Tolkien linguistics]] in general, Hooker says that the word ''Tolkiennymy'' \"describes a branch of Tolkienian Linguistics which studies the lexicology of place and personal names in Tolkien’s Legendarium derived from, and often intended to be perceived as names in first-world languages. It focuses on the etymology, history, and lore of real-world names used in Tolkien’s works, because as Tolkien noted, the Shire map is 'based on some acquaintance with English toponymical history' (L.250).\"<ref>Review by Hooker in [[Beyond Bree]], April 2012, p. 8.</ref>\n\nOne of the most important texts is Tolkien's own ''[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings|Nomenclature]]''.\n\nOne of the goals of ''Tolkiennymy'' is to provide readers with an acquaintance with the history of English toponyms used in Tolkien's works.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word is formed on an analogy of ''[[wikipedia:Toponymy|toponymy]]'', the lexicological study of place names.\n\n{{References}}\n* [[Mark T.
