So, what language would the music of Rhûn be sung in? Rhûn is a large, mostly unexplored area in Tolkien’s published works, left intentionally vague. Tolkien scholars working on our series dug through Tolkien’s unpublished notes and used them to build the foundation of a Rhûnic language, one that has never been heard before by fans. Helping to expand one of Tolkien’s lesser-known languages into a vibrant musical culture was a true honor.|}}\n\n==Inspiration==\nIt is possible that Rhûnic is based on J. R. R.
