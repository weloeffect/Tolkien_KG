The average lifespan of an Orc is unknown, but it is conceivable that he was one of those sent to Moria by [[Sauron]] in about {{TA|2480}}.<ref name=\"TA\">{{App|TA}}</ref> He had one son, Bolg, who succeeded him after his death.<ref name=\"Burst\" />\n\n[[File:Steamey - Azog and Nár.jpg|thumb|left|''Azog and Nár'' by [[:Category:Images by Steamey|Steamey]]]]\n\nAzog entered history in the year {{TA|2790|n}} due to [[Kings of Durin's Folk|King]] Thrór's desire to revisit and perhaps refound the lost realm of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], in whose mighty ruins Azog dwelt.<ref name=\"TA\">{{App|TA}}</ref> He entered the [[Great Gates]], but Azog and his orcs captured and slew him, and branded his hewn head with his own name, \"AZOG\". He flung the head at [[Nár]] who waited outside, then a money purse containing \"few coins of little worth\", warning that he would tolerate no future Dwarf beggars entering his domain at Moria.\n\nWhen news of this reached Thrór's heir [[Thráin]], he was greatly angered, and mustered a force of [[Dwarves]] to seek revenge on Azog. So the War of the Dwarves and Orcs began: the [[Durin's Folk|Longbeards]] hunted Azog, and many battles were fought beneath the earth. After nine years of constant warfare, the climactic Battle of [[Dimrill Dale|Azanulbizar]] was fought before the gates of Moria itself in the year {{TA|2799|n}}.<ref name=\"TA\" />\n\nKing Thráin II and his son [[Thorin]] were in that battle, near the end of which, Azog emerged from the inner gate with his guards, Náin was exhausted and half blind with rage. He tried to swing as hard as he could, but Azog darted aside and Náin missed, splintering his mattocks on the ground. The orc kicked him in the leg when he dodged the Dwarf's blow, making him stumble, at which point Azog attempted to thrust and behead him, succeeding only in breaking Náin's neck because of the strong mail he was wearing. At this point, Azog noticed his retreating forces and retreated back inside. As he did, Dáin II chased him up the steps and beheaded him with a single mighty strike, which became forever known as a deed of great valour considering Dáin's young age. Azog's head was impaled on a spike, with the same coin-filled purse stuffed in his mouth that he had flung at Nár after he killed Thrór nine years before.<ref name=\"App\" />\n\nAzog's underground dominions in the north, though greatly reduced in the War, fell to his son Bolg, who held them for almost 150 years until he too met his end at the [[Battle of Five Armies]] in the year {{TA|2941|n}}.<ref name=\"Burst\" /><ref name=\"TA\" />\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Azog.mp3|Ardamir}}\nThe meaning and origin of the name ''Azog'' is unknown.

He is a white-skinned Orc, known as the Pale Orc or Azog the Defiler. According to [[Balin]], he is from [[Gundabad]]. In the films, the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] appears in a flashback. [[Thrór]] is still alive at this time and is beheaded by Azog during the battle. [[Thorin]] fights with Azog and cuts off his left forearm, and the Pale Orc is dragged off by a few fellow [[Orcs]]. Thorin believes Azog to have died from his wounds, but, unlike in the book, he actually survived the battle and serves as Thorin's nemesis. The Pale Orc is also portrayed as a committed and trusted general of [[Sauron|the Necromancer]] - whereas in the source material his allegiance to the [[Dark Lord]] can only be assumed as a likelihood - and he is therefore tasked by his master first with hindering Oakenshield's quest and later with conquering the [[Erebor|Lonely Mountain]].\n\n:In the films, Azog speaks exclusively in [[Orkish]], whereas his literary counterpart was also known to use the [[Common Speech]]. He rides a gigantic [[Warg Matriarch|white warg]]. He also lacks the iron-clad head he featured in the books.\n\n'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''\n:Azog leads a pack of Orcs on Wargs in hunting down [[Thorin and Company]] to wipe out the [[House of Durin|Line of Durin]] and to take his revenge on Thorin for his wound - even putting out a bounty on Thorin's head. In the film, it is his pack (not the Orcs of [[Goblin-town]]) that catch up to the Company on the other side of the [[Misty Mountains]]; after a brief fight with Thorin, he loses them when they are rescued by the [[Eagles]].\n\n'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''\n:While still in pursuit of Thorin and Company as they come down from the [[Carrock]] and make their way to [[Beorn]]'s house, he is summoned to [[Dol Guldur]] by the Necromancer himself. Though annoyed that yet again he is unable to track down Oakenshield, Azog submits to his master and agrees to lead his armies to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], sending his son Bolg to pursue the Company in his stead. He later leads an unsuccessful attack on [[Gandalf]] when the [[Wizards|Wizard]] enters the fortress prior to the army's departure.\n\n'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''\n:In this movie, Azog's appearance is changed, as he now wears plate armor, and he replaced his claw arm with one that looks similar to a sword. Azog is first seen marching on Erebor. When [[Bolg]] tells him of the [[Elves of Mirkwood|Elven]] Army, he orders him to Gundabad for more troops. From [[Ravenhill]], Azog commands the Orcs in the [[Battle of Five Armies]]. Thorin, [[Fíli]], [[Kíli]] and [[Dwalin]] go to kill Azog, in order to leave the Orcs leaderless. But Azog captures Fíli and kills him in front of Thorin. Azog finally battles Thorin on a frozen lake and is knocked underwater. However, he breaks through the ice and stabs Thorin, mortally wounding him. Despite this, the Dwarf leader manages to stab Azog through the chest with [[Orcrist]] - finally killing the Pale Orc - shortly before succumbing to his own wounds.\n\n===Games===\n'''2021: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Azog appears in an extended flashback depicting the beginning and the end of the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]]. Azog's youngest son \"Komog\" is slain in the halls of [[Gundabad]], while his eldest son \"Urro\" is killed by [[Thorin]] during the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] in the same engagement that earns him the name \"Oakenshield\". [[Bolg]] survives as his only heir by escaping into [[Moria]] shortly before Azog is killed by Dáin.\n\n:In the present day, Azog's descendants continue to plague Durin's Folk. Bolg's son \"Mazog\", Lord of Moria, is the major antagonist of the ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria|Mines of Moria]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Siege of Mirkwood|Siege of Mirkwood]]'' expansions. Bolg's other son \"Gorgar the Ruthless\", Lord of Gundabad, is the chief antagonist of the ''War of Three Peaks'' expansion.\n\n{{references}}<br />\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n| name=Azog\n| race=orc\n| house=\n| born=Before {{TA|2790}}\n| died={{TA|2799}}\n}}\n{{seq\n| prev=Unknown\n| list=[[Orc]]-chieftain\n| dates=Unknown - {{TA|2799}}\n| next=[[Bolg]]\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n{{hobbitfilms}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Azog}}\n[[Category:Black Speech words]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Hobbit]]\n[[Category:Orcs]]\n[[Category:Pronounced articles]]\n[[Category:Rulers in Middle-earth]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[de:Azog]]\n[[fr:/encyclo/personnages/orques/azog]]\n[[fi:Azog]]"}}}
