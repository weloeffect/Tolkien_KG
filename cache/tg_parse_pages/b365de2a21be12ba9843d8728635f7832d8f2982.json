King Dáin, and his second son [[Frór]], were killed by a great [[Cold-drake]] outside the doors to his halls.<ref name=\"Durin\"/>\n\nFollowing the death of their king, most of [[Durin's Folk]] abandoned the Grey Mountains. In {{TA|2590|n}},<ref name=\"AppB\"/> King [[Thrór]] and his uncle [[Borin]] returned to Erebor with the [[Arkenstone]] to re-establish the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]].
