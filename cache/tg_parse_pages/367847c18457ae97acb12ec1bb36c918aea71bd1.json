It is possible that if flowed northwestward into the river [[Isen]], which is the nearest river from the northern end of the Westfold Vale. However, it is also possible that it flowed northeastwards into the river [[Entwash]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe element Deeping in the name Deeping-stream means that the stream belongs to the deep,<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 768</ref> out of which it flows.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2013: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Deeping-stream originates inside the [[Glittering Caves]] and forms a small pool with an island in the middle before flowing out through the [[Deeping Wall]]. After flowing into [[Westfold]], the stream turns east and joins the river ''Swiftwater'', originating in the [[White Mountains]], before eventually flowing into [[Entwash]].\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Rivers of Rohan]]\n[[Category:Streams]]\n[[de:Klammbach]]\n[[fi:Syvänteenvirta]]"}}}
