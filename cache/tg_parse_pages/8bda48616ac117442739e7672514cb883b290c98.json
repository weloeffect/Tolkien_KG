The Ringwraiths from Dol Guldur informed their fellow Ringwraiths from Minas Morgul that Gollum had escaped and vanished.

In their interpretation, he was born as Komûl in {{SA|1744}} and was heir to the [[Womaw]] kingdom in the East. His mother died when he was young, and he was raised by his manipulative stepmother, an Elf named Dardarian. She instilled in him a constant longing for immortality.\n\n:By {{SA|1994}}, Komûl's people faced increasing pressure from their distant Númenórean cousins, who were establishing trade and military outposts in the East. To counter this threat, Komûl turned to his stepmother, Dardarian, who was in secret a servant of Sauron. By {{SA|1996}}, Komûl had accepted her gift, a [[Nine Rings|Ring of Power]], and came under the Dark Lord's sway. Komûl was ultimately forced to abdicate a year later in favour of a Numenorean-supported faction led by his popular cousin.\n\n:He resurfaced at Barad-dûr in {{SA|2000}}. From then on he was known as Khamûl.<ref group=note>Noted to be the Black Speech pronunciation of his given name.</ref> When Sauron was imprisoned by [[Ar-Pharazôn]], he fled to his mother's people, the Shay. After the [[Downfall of Númenor|Downfall]] he returned to Mordor, but passed into the shadows as Sauron was defeated during the [[War of the Last Alliance]].\n\n:Khamûl reappeared around {{TA|1050}}, briefly residing with Sauron at Dol Guldur in Mirkwood. From there, he sought to gain influence over the peoples of southeastern Middle-earth, often working with [[Third of the Nazgûl|Dwar]] and contending with the [[Blue Wizards]]. During the [[Watchful Peace]], he lived at Minas Morgul but frequently traveled to Dol Guldur. During one of these visits, he captured [[Thráin]], taking his [[Seven Rings|Ring]] but failed to extract useful information from him.\n\n:Khamûl wore a distinctive blue dragonhelm, and wielded several weapons in addition to his [[Morgul-knife]]:<ref name=ICE>{{ICE|8003}}, pp. 92-94</ref>\n* ''Water-skimmer'', a Cuivac-wooden killing-[[Wikipedia:Bolas|bola]].<ref>{{ICE|2010}}, pp. 49</ref>\n* ''Stinging Tongue'', a [[Mallorn]]-inlaid blowgun.<ref>{{ICE|2010}}, pp. 49</ref>\n\n'''2001-: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game]]'':'''\n:Khamûl received two named miniatures in the game, one depicting his cloaked form and the other his armored appearance as seen in ''The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies''. The latter explicitly identifies Khamûl as the Ringwraith with a more ornate version of the Easterling helmets seen in ''The Lord of the Rings''.\n\n'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)]]'':'''\n:During the nighttime section of the Shire level, Frodo overhears the conversation between Khamûl and [[Gaffer Gamgee]] just as he is about to deliver the [[Bag End]] key to Number 3, Bagshot Row. The conversation plays out as it does in the novel except that Khamûl's lines are audible. Instead of simply walking back down the path after the conversation ends, Khamûl (who is mounted on his horse) intimidates the Gaffer by rearing his steed while letting out a ghastly wail, before galloping back down the road. No voice actor is specified for the role.\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Nazgûl in charge of Dol Guldur is known simply as \"The Lieutenant of Dol Guldur\", formerly \"The Cursed Rider\". He is said to have been an Easterling chieftain who wielded the Ring \"Orôm, the Warmonger\".\n[[File:Andrea Piparo - The Black Easterling.jpg|thumb|250px|\"The Black Easterling\" by [[:Category:Images by Andrea Piparo|Andrea Piparo]]]]\n'''2024: ''[[War of the Ring: The Card Game]]'':'''\n:Khamûl appears in \"The Black Easterling\" card and is illustrated by [[:Category:Images by Andrea Piparo|Andrea Piparo]].\n{{References|note}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Khamul}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:Easterlings]]\n[[Category:Nazgûl]]\n[[Category:Second Age characters]]\n[[Category:Servants of Sauron]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[de:Khamûl]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/hommes/3a/nazgul/khamul]]\n[[fi:Khamûl]]"}}}
