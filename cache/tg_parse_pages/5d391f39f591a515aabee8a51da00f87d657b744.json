Most were of the Brandybuck family, who colonized the land. Buckland was thus technically not part of the Shire itself, and was effectively a tiny independent country.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Matěj Čadil - Brandy Hall.jpg|left|thumb|[[Matěj Čadil]] - ''Brandy Hall'']]\n740 years after the founding of [[the Shire]], in {{TA|2340}},<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2340 of the Third Age</ref> [[Gorhendad Oldbuck]] crossed the River [[Brandywine]] from the [[Eastfarthing]] and started the building of [[Brandy Hall]] in [[Buck Hill]], in a land hitherto unpopulated by hobbits.<ref name=\"Brandybucks\">{{FR|Conspiracy}}, fourth paragraph</ref>\n\nAs Gorhendad's family grew, the Hall also expanded, and soon there was a flourishing community in the land between the River and the Old Forest. From that time, Buckland was ruled by the [[Brandybuck Family|Brandybuck]]s (as Gorhendad renamed his family to reflect their new relationship with the river). Gorhendad became the first '[[Master of Buckland]]'.<ref name=\"Brandybucks\" />\n\nThe village of [[Bucklebury]], lying close by [[Buck Hill]], was Buckland's chief village,<ref name=\"Brandybucks\" /> but with the expanding population, many other villages soon grew up in the region, the largest of which were [[Newbury]], [[Crickhollow]] and [[Standelf]].<ref name=\"Part\" /> The growing power of the Master of Buckland gained respect from those close by in the Eastfarthing, too; the lands of the [[Marish]] between [[Stock]] and [[Rushey]] also acknowledged themselves under the sway of Brandy Hall.<ref>{{FR|Conspiracy}}, fifth paragraph</ref>\n\nThe Bucklanders soon found themselves threatened by the strange trees of the Forest, and so built a vast hedge, the [[High Hay]], stretching twenty miles along the eastern border of their land.<ref>{{FR|Conspiracy}}, sixth paragraph</ref> This was not the only danger to threaten Buckland - in {{TA|2911}}, the year of the [[Fell Winter (Third Age)|Fell Winter]], the Brandywine froze<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2911 of the Third Age</ref> and Buckland was invaded by [[white Wolves]].<ref>{{FR|Knife}}, seventh paragraph</ref><ref>{{FR|South}}</ref>\n[[File:Matěj Čadil - Crickhollow.jpg|thumb|[[Matěj Čadil]] - ''Crickhollow'']]\nBuckland was also the childhood home of [[Frodo Baggins]],<ref>{{FR|Party}}, sixteenth paragraph</ref> who returned here on his journey to [[Bree]] in {{TA|3018}}.<ref name=\"Conspiracy\">{{FR|Conspiracy}}</ref> He bought a house in Crickhollow, and claimed that he would be living there,<ref>{{FR|Three}}, seventeenth paragraph</ref> but instead entered the [[Old Forest]] through the old private<ref name=\"Conspiracy\" /> gate of the Brandybucks through the High Hay, and left the Shire.<ref>{{FR|Forest}}</ref>\n\n==Status==\nBuckland was technically not part of the Shire (as granted by the [[King of Arthedain]]), and was indeed formed over 300 years after [[Arthedain]] ceased to exist.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1976 of the Third Age</ref> Buckland may actually have been in what used to be considered part of [[Cardolan]] and may never have belonged to Arthedain, further making its colonization an independent action by the Hobbits. Thus, Buckland was essentially a small independent country of Hobbits, mostly of the Brandybuck family.<ref name=\"Brandybucks\" />  \n\nHowever, it was effectively not much different from other Hobbit family homelands (such as the [[Tookland]], which the [[Took Family|Tooks]] were effectively controlling). Authority in the Shire had become so bucolic and decentralized that no one took the time to assert these rival claims. Parts of the Marish, part of the Shire-proper, acknowledge the authority of the Master of Buckland and not the [[Thain]] of the Shire.\n\nIn practice, Hobbits from the Shire-proper seem to have considered Buckland an odd frontier of \"the Shire\" more than as a separate country.\n\n==Culture==\nThe Bucklanders did have certain peculiarities. There was an ubiquitous sentiment in other regions of the Shire (such as [[Hobbiton]] and [[Bywater]]) that \"there's queer folk in Buckland\".\n\nDue in part to the [[Fallohides|Fallohidish]] blood of the Brandybucks, they were somewhat more adventurous than their cousins in the Shire (while still conservative by the measure of many other races in Middle-earth). The Bucklanders are characterized as being of predominantly [[Stoors|Stoor]] ancestry, and were thus a people accustomed to riversides. They enjoyed boating, an activity frowned upon by Shire-hobbits, and some of them could even swim. Due to the often muddy nature of the land near the river, it was not uncommon for Bucklanders to wear boots, making them the only Hobbits known to wear shoes.\n\nWhen the [[Bree-folk]] ventured to the Shire, Buckland was their usual destination (though some ventured as far as the Eastfarthing), and so was rather more cosmopolitan (in hobbit terms) than the rest of the land.\n\nLiving under constant danger from the Old Forest, the Bucklanders were hardier and more suspicious than the usual Shire-hobbit. They were organised to deal with danger (through the famous [[Horn-call of Buckland]]), and they kept their doors locked at night, which was unusual in the Shire.\n\nThere were some minor linguistic regional differences between Buckland and the Shire (perhaps also in the accents) as the Bucklanders, being descended from the Stoors, inherited the [[Stoorish]] linguistic features. Also, Hobbits of Stoorish blood are noted as being the only Hobbits who are known to normally grow facial hair.\n\n==Part of the Shire?==\n{{rewrite}}\nIn the \"[[Prologue Concerning Hobbits, and other matters]]\" in the ''[[Fellowship of the Ring]]'' [[Tolkien]] states:\n{{Blockquote|Outside the Farthings were the East and West Marches: the Buckland''';''' and the [[Westmarch]] added to the Shire in {{SR|1452}}.<ref name=EastMarch>{{FR|Ordering}} p. 12</ref>}}\n\nEarlier editions do not have the semicolon and give the year as {{SR|1462|n}}.\n\nWithout the semicolon, the sentence seems to imply that not only Westmarch, but also Buckland was added to the Shire in {{FoA|31}} (or {{FoA|41}} according to the old edition). \n\nSeveral reference works interpret the phrase in such a way, and refer to it as \"Eastmarch\", although Tolkien used the spelling \"East March\",<ref name=\"EastMarch\" /> and the area is still typically referred to as \"Buckland\".\n\n[[Robert Foster]] says: ''Buckland was officially added to [the Shire] by the gift of [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] in FA 42 and was then known as the East March''.<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 57 entry \"Buckland\"</ref> Note also that his dating of FA 42 mirrors the earlier uncorrected date of the \"Prologue\".\n\n[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] also says: ''Two adjacent areas were added to the Shire: the Eastmarch (Buckland) and...''<ref>[[Karen Fonstad]], ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'', p. 69, The Shire</ref>\n\nThe semicolon in the above quote, which separates Buckland from Westmarch, was added to show that only \"the [[Westmarch]] added to the Shire\". That is consistent with various other references, such as that the [[Appendix B]] mentions the creation of the Westmarch in {{FoA|31}}, but there is no reference to Buckland or an \"Eastmarch\" under that year.<ref>{{App|Later}}, entry for the year 1452 in the Shire Reckoning (S.R.)</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''[[Wiktionary:buck|buck]]'' means \"goat\" or \"deer\", and comes from the family name [[Oldbucks]].\n\n''Buckland'' and ''Little Buckland'' are real places in England, located just to the south of [[Evesham]].<ref>[[Mark T. Hooker]], ''[[The Hobbitonian Anthology]]'', pp. 97, 112</ref> The etymology of these towns comes from ''book'' (i.e. The Bible), referring to a land that was owned by a church or a written charter.<ref name=\"Nomen\">{{HM|N}}, p. 754</ref> There is a Buckland in the former county of [[Wikipedia:Brecknockshire|Brecknockshire]] (modern day Powys), Wales in the parish of Llan-sant-ffraid. The gloss for this Welsh ''Buckland'' exactly matches Tolkien's instructions in ''[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings|Nomenclature]]'' for translating the name ''Buckland''. It means the \"land of the deer\".<ref>[[Mark T. Hooker]], ''[[Tolkien and Welsh]]'' pp. 18-19</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nTolkien mentioned that the survival of traces of the older language of the Stoors and the Bree-men resembled the survival of [[Celtic]] elements in England.<ref>{{App|Translation}}, twelfth and thirteenth paragraphs</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Buckland.jpg|thumb|250px|Buckland in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Although the entirety of Buckland's as defined by the [[Old Forest]]'s border is present in the game, the southern section is fenced off and is inaccessible.\n\n{{References}}\n\n{{masters}}\n\n[[Category:Buckland]]\n[[de:Bockland]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/regions/comte/pays de bouc]]\n[[fi:Bukinmaa]]"}}}
