As such, the island housed [[Gondorian]] fortifications at various points in history.\n\n==History==\nHistorians in [[Gondor]] believed that the [[Drúedain]] were the first men who crossed the Anduin in the late [[First Age]].  They believed that they came from lands south of Mordor, turned north into Ithilien and probably crossed the Anduin near Cair Andros before settling in the vales of the [[White Mountains]] and the wooded lands at their northern feet.<ref>{{UT|12b}}</ref>\n\nUpon the establishment of the realm of Gondor, the island grew in strategic importance. Gondor took steps to fortify the island, too.  In {{TA|1248}} [[Minalcar]], [[Regent of Gondor|regent]] to King [[Narmacil I]], defeated the [[Easterlings]] and upon his return fortified the west bank of the Anduin up to the [[Limlight]],<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Minalcar, p. 1046</ref> which may have included the fortification of Cair Andros. \n\nThe island was also manned at the time of King [[Ondoher]]'s fall<ref>{{UT|Northmen}}</ref> in {{TA|1944|n}}.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Ondoher, p. 1049</ref>\n\nAfter the granting of [[Calenardhon]] to the [[Éothéod]] in {{TA|2510}} (who created the realm of [[Rohan]])<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2510, p. 1087</ref> Cair Andros remained a vulnerable crossing-point for the [[Gondorians]] who took Cair Andros' risk seriously. [[Amon Dîn]], the first of the [[Warning beacons of Gondor|Beacon-hills]], was set up originally to keep watch over any attempt by enemies to cross the Anduin at or near Cair Andros and to warn the citizens of [[Minas Tirith]] with its beacon.<ref>{{UT|8e}}, Note 51</ref>\n\nCenturies later, [[Túrin II]] fortified the island again in about the year {{TA|2901|n}}<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2901, p. 1088</ref> to protect Anórien.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}, entry for Steward Túrin II, p. 1054</ref>\n\n===War of the Ring===\nOn the same day that the [[Witch-king]] rode from [[Minas Morgul]] with the armies that would [[Siege of Gondor|besiege Minas Tirith]], Sauron released a smaller force (more than 6,000 Orcs and Men) from the [[Morannon]]. They overwhelmed the Gondorian defences of Cair Andros on [[10 March]], {{TA|3019}} and used the island to cross into Anórien.<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019, March 10, p. 1093</ref> This force blocked the eastward progress of the [[Rohirrim]] as they rode to Gondor's aid.<ref>{{RK|Siege}}, p. 821</ref> \n\nHowever, the Rohirrim used the secret ride down [[Stonewain Valley]]<ref>{{RK|Ride}}, pp. 832-4</ref> and, after the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], three thousand riders of the Rohirrim under the command of [[Elfhelm]]<ref>{{RK|Debate}}, p. 882</ref> chased that force down and pushed them back out of Anórien so that it fled towards Cair Andros.<ref>{{RK|Gate}}, p. 883</ref> Apparently the island was held by that force for some days.<ref name=Gate>{{RK|Gate}}, p. 886</ref> \n\nOn [[23 March]],<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019, March 23, p. 1094</ref> in his march on Mordor, [[Aragorn]] gave a leave to one thousand scared young men from Rohan and [[Lossarnach]] from his main army, with orders to retake the island if necessary.<ref name=Gate/> They must have succeeded, because many ships lay by its shores, as glimpsed by [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] from the [[Field of Cormallen]] on [[8 April]].<ref name=Cormallen/> After many days of camping in the Field of Cormallen, the Captains of the West went aboard the ship with all their men and sailed from Cair Andros down Anduin to Osgiliath.<ref>{{RK|Cormallen}}, p. 957</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Cair Andros'' is [[Sindarin]] for \"Ship of Long Foam\",<ref name=\"Stewards\"/> from ''[[cirya|cair]]'' (\"ship\") + ''[[and]]'' (\"long\") + ''[[ros]]'' (\"foam\").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entries ''[[and|an(d)]]'', ''[[ros]]''</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Cair Andros.jpg|thumb|right|Cair Andros in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2015: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n: The Lord of Cair Andros Gilgír and two of his sons were killed when the island was overrun, but his wife Dúneth and his youngest son Tolwin escaped to the west and survived.
