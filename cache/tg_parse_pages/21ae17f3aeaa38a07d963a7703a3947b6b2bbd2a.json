''Carn Dûm'' loc.|website=Eldamo|accessed=30 March 2021}}</ref> [[David Salo]] also favours the Sindarin interpretation, giving it as \"Red Valley\", a compound of ''[[caran|carn]]'' + ''[[tum|tûm]]''.<ref>{{HM|GS}}, pp. 102, 371</ref> \n\nAnother suggestion, is that the name roughly translates as \"mountain fortress\" in [[wikipedia:Gaelic|Gaelic]]; although Tolkien uses [[Celtic]] elements for some translated [[Mannish]] names, this would have been the only instance where he uses Gaelic. It is unknown whether this is just coincidence or not.<ref>[http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/c/carndum.html ''Carn Dûm''] at the [[Encyclopedia of Arda]]</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Carn Dûm.jpg|thumb|right|Carn Dum in ''The Lord of the Rings Online'']]\n'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king]]'':'''\n:Carn Dûm is the capital of [[Angmar]].
