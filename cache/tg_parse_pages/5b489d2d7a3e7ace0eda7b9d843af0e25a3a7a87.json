Gordon]] and [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] when the two were professors at [[University of Leeds|Leeds University]] in the 1920s. At meetings of the club students and faculty would gather to read [[Old Norse|Old Icelandic]] sagas and drink together in an informal setting. Members of the club also invented original songs and poems in [[Old English]], [[Gothic]], [[Old Norse]] and other extinct Germanic languages. A collection of these works was privately published as ''[[Songs for the Philologists]]''.\n\nSimilar groups have continued at Leeds University since the time of Tolkien and Gordon. As of [[2015]] the successor of the Viking Club was known as the Old Norse Reading Group, and associated with Gordon's distant successor, Alaric Hall.<ref>[https://www.leeds.ac.uk/news/article/3678/collection_highlights_jrr_tolkiens_time_at_the_university_of_leeds Collection highlights JRR Tolkien's time at the University of Leeds].
