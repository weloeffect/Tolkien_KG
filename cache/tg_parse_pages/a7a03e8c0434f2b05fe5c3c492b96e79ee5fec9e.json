The city lay on the south-east shore of [[Lake Evendim|Lake Nenuial]], near the source of the [[Baranduin]] river.  To the south and west of Annúminas rose the [[Hills of Evendim]].<ref>{{UT|West}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe city was founded by [[Elendil]] in {{SA|3320}} shortly after his arrival in [[Lindon]] following the destruction of [[Númenor]].<ref>{{PM|Second}}, p. 176</ref>  With the establishment of Arnor the city became the capital of the realm for several centuries; and was home to the [[Annúminas-stone]], one of the three ''[[palantíri]]'' of the North-Kingdom,<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref> and the [[Sceptre of Annúminas]], originally the rod of office of the [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] [[Lords of Andúnië]], the heirloom of and symbol of kingship in Arnor.<ref name=Eriador>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>\n\nDue to losses in the war against [[Sauron]] and the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]], the number of the [[Dúnedain of Arnor]] began to dwindle, until eventually Annúminas was deserted and [[Fornost Erain]] became the capital.<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref><ref group=note>[[Robert Foster]], in ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', suggested that the city was deserted sometime between {{TA}} 250<!--Do not add a link to TA 250--> and {{TA|861|n}}.  The latter date is when the kingdom of Arnor fractured into three separate successor kingdoms.</ref> After {{TA|861}} the ruins of Annúminas belonged to the petty Arnorian successor kingdom of [[Arthedain]].\n\nThe two relics which had been housed in Annúminas survived the city: The ''palantír'' remained for more than a millennium after the loss of its city, but was ultimately drowned with [[Arvedui]] in the [[Icebay of Forochel|cold northern seas]].<ref name=Eriador/>  The silver Sceptre of Annúminas would have been removed to Fornost by the Kings, and eventually came to be kept by [[Elrond]] in [[Rivendell]].<ref>{{App|Tale}}</ref>\n\nAt the time of the coronation of [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] at the end of the [[Third Age]] Annúminas had lain in ruins for more than two thousand years. Yet Aragorn soon set his mind to preparing a place to stay in the ancient city. Aragorn sometimes came North to his house in Annúminas restored and stayed for a while beside Lake Evendim, and when that happened everyone in [[the Shire]] was said to be glad.<ref name=Eriador/>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Annúminas'' is [[Sindarin]] from ''[[Annûn|annún]]'' (\"west\") and ''[[minas]]'' (\"tower\"): \"Tower of the West\".<ref>{{S|Index}}, entry \"Annúminas\"</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nEarly names for Annúminas were Tarkilmar,<ref>{{TI|VII}}, p.144</ref> or Westermanton. Torfirion is an Elvish name appearing in the [[The 1943 Map of The Lord of the Rings]] and on the western part of the [[The First Map of The Lord of the Rings]].\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n[[File:Annúminas LOTRO.jpg|200px|thumb|A view of Annúminas in ''The Lord of the Rings Online'']]\n:The city of Annúminas is available for exploration and adventuring in its entirety. It is partially submerged in the waters of the lake and is overrun by servants of Angmar, who invaded the city looking for instructions to operate its palantír. A group of the Dúnedain of the North, calling themselves Wardens of Annuminas, strives to preserve the ancient city of their ancestors and its rich history, taking fight against Angmar forces, Tomb-Robbers seeking to plunder ancient relics and even the forces of nature itself when necessary. The city is situated on the hill slope and as such is presented as a multi-levelled place akin to [[Minas Tirith]]: travellers are constantly going either uphill or downhill to reach their destination. Inside the city are several market places, living quarters, pools, gardens and other artefacts of everyday life. At the highest point is the King's Seat of power - the chamber of Ost Elendil. To the east of the city lies the Way of Kings - a row of tombs where Kings of Arnor reside, including a ceremonial Tomb of Elendil, where some of his belongings are buried in memory of the city's founder.\n\n[[File:ArdaCraft Annúminas.png|200px|thumb|left|The ruins of Annúminas on [[ArdaCraft]]'']]\n'''2017: ''[[ArdaCraft]]'':'''\n:As part of their effort to re-create all of Middle-earth, [[ArdaCraft]] built Annúminas in the late Third Age, long after it had been abandoned. It drew inspiration from Roman, Byzantine and Babylonian ruins.\n\n{{references|notes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Annuminas}}\n[[Category:Arnor]]\n[[Category:Cities, towns and villages]]\n[[Category:Pronounced articles]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[de:Annúminas]]\n[[fi:Annúminas]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/villes tours et forteresses/eriador/annuminas]]"}}}
