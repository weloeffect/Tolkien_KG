Crafted by [[Dwarves]] using gems brought from [[Valinor]], it was of great grace and beauty and bestowed these qualities upon its wearer. Despite being loaded with gems, it sat lightly on the neck.<ref name=\"return\" />\n\nIt later incorporated the [[Silmaril]] retrieved by [[Beren]] from [[Morgoth]]'s [[Iron Crown]], which made it more beautiful than anything ever before seen in [[Arda]]. Because of the Silmaril it was coveted by the [[Sons of Fëanor]] and became entangled in the [[Doom of the Noldor]]. \n\n==History==\nThe Nauglamír was a golden necklace made for [[Finrod Felagund]] by the [[Dwarves]] of [[Nogrod]] and [[Belegost]], in which were set countless gems that Finrod had brought from [[Valinor]].<ref name=\"return\">{{S|Return}}</ref> Despite this, the carcanet weighed no more than if it was made of straw. It was Finrod's most prized treasure in [[Nargothrond]] and the most famed Dwarven work of the [[Elder Days]].<ref name=\"doriath\">{{S|Doriath}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pete Amachree - Húrin finds the Nauglamír, in the ruins of Nargothrond.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Húrin finds the Nauglamír, in the ruins of Nargothrond'' by [[:Category:Images by Pete Amachree|Pete Amachree]]]]\nAfter the [[Fall of Nargothrond]],<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref> the Nauglamír remained forgotten in the hoard of [[Glaurung]]. [[Húrin|Húrin Thalion]] later found it and brought the famed treasure to the Kingdom of [[Doriath]]. He threw it on the floor before [[Thingol]],  scornfully thanking the elven king for fostering [[Turin Turambar|Turin]], his son, and [[Morwen]], his wife. [[Melian|Queen Melian]] spoke to Húrin, seeking to calm his anger, and looking long into her eyes he at last perceived the truth of how Morgoth had twisted all that he had made him see to further his woe. Picking up the Nauglamír, he offered it to Thingol: \n\n{{blockquote|‘Receive now, lord, the Necklace of the Dwarves, as a gift from one who has nothing, and as a memorial of Húrin of Dor-lómin. For now my fate is fulfilled, and the purpose of Morgoth achieved; but I am his thrall no longer.’|''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', \"[[Of the Ruin of Doriath]]\"}}\n\nAfter Húrin left Doriath, Thingol sought to have the treasure remade to include the [[Silmaril]] of [[Lúthien]] and [[Beren]] that he had grown to love fiercely, so that he may wear it day and night. For this he employed the [[Dwarves of Nogrod]] who had been invited to [[Menegroth]].<ref name=\"doriath\" />\n\nThe Dwarves were enthralled by the beauty of the Nauglamír and the Silmaril, and desired to possess them for themselves but agreed to the task. After they completed their work, they refused to hand the treasure to Thingol, who had come alone into their smithy to receive it. They claimed that the Elven king had no right to the Nauglamír, since their fathers had made it for [[Finrod Felagund]] alone, and that it was stolen by Húrin from the halls of [[Nargothrond]]. Thingol understood well that they only wished to possess the Silmaril and answered with scorn: \n {{blockquote|‘How do ye of uncouth race dare to demand aught of me, Elu Thingol, Lord of Beleriand, whose life began by the waters of Cuiviénen years uncounted ere the fathers of the stunted people awoke?’|''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', \"[[Of the Ruin of Doriath]]\"}}\nAfter this, he called for them to leave Menegroth without payment. The Dwarves, enraged by his words, slew the king as he stood among them and took the Nauglamír for themselves, carrying it off towards their home in the mountains. Yet as they fled eastwards, they were pursued and killed by the avenging Elves, who returned the Nauglamír to Doriath. However, two of Thingol's murderers had managed to slip through the Elves' grasp and returned to [[Nogrod]], where they lied about the cause for the slaying of their kinsmen, saying that Thingol had ordered them killed to cheat them of their payment. This news roused the [[Dwarves of Nogrod]] to war, and they marched against Doriath, which now lay open to its enemies- the [[Girdle of Melian]] protected the realm no longer, for Melian had left Middle-Earth soon after Thingol's death and returned to the [[Undying Lands]]. As a result, the army of the Dwarves overwhelmed the Elves, and they ransacked Menegroth during a [[battle in the Thousand Caves]], stealing the entire treasure of Doriath, including the Nauglamír. Following their victory, the Dwarves were waylaid by [[Beren]] and a host of [[Green-elves]] of [[Ossiriand]] at [[Sarn Athrad]], who had been informed of what had befallen in Doriath by a messenger. The Dwarves were all [[Battle of Sarn Athrad|slain]], and the treasure was cast into the [[Ascar|River Ascar]], except for the Nauglamír, which Beren bore back to Lúthien at [[Tol Galen]].<ref name=\"doriath\" /> \n\n[[File:Peter Xavier Price - The Request of Thingol.jpg|thumb|''The Request of Thingol'' by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]]\nLúthien wore the Nauglamír for the rest of her life, their combined beauty being the fairest sight east of Valinor. After her second death, a lord of the [[Green-elves]] brought it to Doriath to her son, [[Dior]]. When the [[Sons of Fëanor]] heard about its whereabouts, compelled by the [[Oath of Fëanor]], they demanded the [[Silmaril]] from Dior, who gave no answer; and so the [[Sons of Fëanor]] attacked Doriath, resulting in the [[Second Kinslaying]] and the death of Dior. But their attempt to reclaim the Silmaril failed, as Dior's daughter [[Elwing]] had fled beforehand to the [[Havens of Sirion]], carrying the Nauglamír with her.<ref name=\"doriath\" />\n\nThe Sons of Fëanor continued their pursuit of the Silmaril and attacked the Mouths of Sirion, leading to the [[Third Kinslaying]], but Elwing cast herself into the sea to escape them, wearing the Nauglamír around her neck. While it is unknown what happened to the Nauglamír itself after this, Elwing and the Silmaril were saved by [[Ulmo]], who brought her in the form of a great white bird to her husband [[Eärendil]] aboard his ship, ''[[Vingilot]]'', in the middle of the night. Elwing was returned to her human form by morning, and together they sought the undying lands of [[Aman]]. Guided by the light of the Silmaril, which Eärendil bound to his brow, they pierced through the [[Shadowy Seas]], and found their way to [[Valinor]].<ref>{{S|24}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Nauglamír'' is formed from the words ''[[naug]]'' (\"dwarf\") + ''[[mîr]]'' (\"jewel\").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entries ''mîr'', ''naug''</ref>\nIn the [[The Etymologies|''Etymologies'']] the word ''nauglamîr'' is listed as [[Doriathrin]],<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 373, entry \"[[MIR|MIR-]]\")</ref> while the true [[Noldorin]] idiom is said to be ''Mîr na Nauglin'' or ''Nauglvir'' (-> ''Nauglavir'').<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 375, entry \"NAUK-\" (note that [[Christopher Tolkien]] uses the capitalized form of ''Mîr'' in the Index, cf. p. 442)</ref>\n\nThe necklace was also known as '''''Sigil Elu-naeth''''' (\"Necklace of the Woe of Thingol\").<ref>{{WJ|I}}, p. 258</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n===Early legendarium===\n====''The Book of Lost Tales'' and associated texts====\nIn ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', the '''''Nauglafring''''' is made by the Dwarves directly for Thingol and specifically for the Silmaril, it is crafted from gold, which was given to Thingol by [[Úrin]] from the sacking of [[Rodothlim]].<ref>{{LT2}} pp. 114, 115, 227, 228</ref>\nThe Nauglamír more directly causes the death of Thingol as it gets caught behind a tree branch when Thingol is riding outside the [[Girdle of Melian]] and is attacked by the Dwarves.
