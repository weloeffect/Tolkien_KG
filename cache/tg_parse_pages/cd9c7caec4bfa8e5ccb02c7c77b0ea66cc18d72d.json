A note suggests that it was one of the sources of [[Aelfwine]], who had seen the work. ''Lhammas'' is actually composed of two versions of the same revised text. The later and third form of the text, having the title ''Lammasethen'', is shorter and deviates from the ''Lhammas'' at some points.\n\nThe essay represents an old linguistic view of the [[Languages]] of [[Middle-earth]] (which was later dropped) in which all languages belonged to either the [[Valarin]], [[Oromëan]], [[Aulëan]], or [[Melkian]] phylums:\n\n*The ''Valarin'' phylum is the origin of all other phylums and led to [[Valarin]] (the language of the [[Valar]].)\n*''[[Oromëan]]'' is named after the Vala [[Oromë]] and is used for all languages of the [[Elves]], because Oromë taught the Elves language. Most languages of [[Men]] also belong to this phylum.\n*''[[Aulëan]]'' is named after the Vala [[Aulë]], father of the [[Dwarves]], and is the origin of the [[Khuzdul]] language. It has had some influences on the tongues of Men.\n*''[[Melkian]]'' is named after the fallen Vala [[Morgoth|Melkor]] (or Morgoth), and is the origin of the [[Black Speech]] of the [[Orcs]] and other evil beings.\n\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] later revised and simplified the linguistic history of his world, and some elements cannot be applied to the later languages of Middle-earth. However, Tolkien in later writings still held that [[Rúmil (elf of Tirion)|Rúmil]] wrote '''''L'''ammas'', but himself never wrote an \"updated\" form that would be coherent with his later mythology.\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''lhammas'' is [[Noldorin]] and roughly means \"assortment of languages\" (cf. [[Quenya]] word ''[[lambë]]''). When Tolkien revised the history of the languages and Noldorin became [[Sindarin]], he renamed the word as ''lammas'' (initial ''lh'' changed to ''l''. See also: [[Noldorin]]).\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[The Tree of Tongues]]\n\n[[Category:Linguistics]]\n[[Category:The Lost Road and Other Writings chapters]]"}}}
