They were mainly used as guard-posts and watch-towers around the edges of [[Lothlórien]].<ref name=\"Loth\">{{FR|Lorien}}</ref> \n\nIn [[Caras Galadhon]], however, ''telain'' were more common and served more of a ceremonial function: it was on a house built on a ''talan'' that the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]] met with [[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]].<ref name=\"Mirror\">{{FR|Mirror}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Flet'' is an archaic English word referring to the floor of a house or a flat.\n\nThe [[Sindarin]] word ''talan'' or ''tâl'' (\"flat space, platform\"; pl. ''telain'') is a descendant form of [[Common Eldarin]] ''talam-''. The [[Quenya]] form is ''talma'' or ''talan'', pl. ''talami''.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 52</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''\n:''Telain'' were retained in the film, although there were no moveable plaited screens or rope-ladders visible. In ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' the meeting with [[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]] took place inside a large hall built on a ''talan'',<ref name=\"Mirror\">{{FR|Mirror}}</ref> whereas in the film it took place on an open ''talan''.\n\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Caras Galadhon2.jpg|thumb|250px|Telain of Caras Galadhon in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2008: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:All Telain outside of Caras Galadhon have open sides and perform mostly defensive function, although some are recreational. Within Caras Galadhon itself, the larger telain are enclosed from the outside, while the wooden platforms themselves still provide an open walkable area.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Buildings]]\n[[Category:Forests]]\n[[Category:Nandor]]\n[[Category:Sindarin nouns]]\n[[de:Flett]]\n[[fi:Talan]]"}}}
