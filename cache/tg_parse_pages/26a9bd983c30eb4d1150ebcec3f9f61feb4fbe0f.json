In the centre of the [[Ring of Isengard]] stood the stone tower of [[Orthanc]].<ref name=\"FRCouncil\"/>\n\n==Description==\nThe fortress of Isengard was located in a valley at the southern tip of the [[Misty Mountains]]; the [[Ring of Isengard]] was a great wall of stone that ran out from the mountain-side and then back again. The only entrance to Isengard was found delved into the southern wall of Isengard. One entering Isengard would pass through its only gate, travel down the long tunnel and pass through the iron doors to come to the plain of Isengard. In the centre of the plain, half a mile from the gate, stood the looming tower of [[Orthanc]]. For most of its history the lands of Isengard were green and a river ran from the mountains to form a lake. However after the treason of Saruman all green things that grew were removed and the river was dammed. The inner-ring was riddled with houses which cut into the walls. About the plain great shafts had been dug deep and many stone-flags paved the roads of the surface.<ref name=\"TTFlotsam\"/><ref name=\"TTRoad\">{{TT|Road}}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|A great ring-wall of stone, like towering cliffs, stood out from the shelter of the mountain-side, from which it ran and then returned again. One entrance only was there made in it, a great arch delved in the southern wall. Here through the black rock a long tunnel had been hewn, closed at either end with mighty doors of iron. They were so wrought and poised upon their huge hinges, posts of steel driven into the living stone, that when unbarred they could be moved with a light thrust of the arms, noiselessly. One who passed in and came at length out of the echoing tunnel, beheld a plain, a great circle, somewhat hollowed like a vast shallow bowl: a mile it measured from rim to rim.|''[[The Two Towers]]'', \"[[The Road to Isengard]]\"}}\n\n==History==\n===Second Age===\n[[File:Rob Alexander - Isengard.jpg|thumb|''Isengard'' by [[Rob Alexander]]]]\nIt is unknown exactly when Isengard was first established. However it must have been built between {{SA|3320}}, the year in which the realms of [[Gondor]] and [[Arnor]] were established, and {{SA|3430}}, the year in which the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] was formed to resist [[Sauron]]'s tyranny.<ref>{{App|B1}}</ref> The [[Ring of Isengard]], and the tower of [[Orthanc]] therein, were built by the [[Dúnedain]], the Exiles of [[Númenor]], as a fortress on the north-western tip of Gondor. Within Orthanc was placed one of the seven seeing stones, the ''[[palantíri]]''.<ref name=\"SV\"/> This stone would hence be referred to as the [[Orthanc-stone]].<ref name=\"TTP\">{{TT|Palantir}}</ref>\n\n===Third Age===\n[[Calenardhon]], a region never densely populated, suffered greatly at the hands of the {{TA|1636}} [[Great Plague]]. [[Orthanc]] was thus closed and its keys were sent to [[Minas Tirith]].<ref name=\"UTP\">{{UT|Palantiri}}</ref> The fortress of Isengard, however, remained manned by a small garrison led by a hereditary Gondorian chieftain. This company grew more secretive as time progressed; its chieftain became known as the \"[[Lord of Isengard]]\" and they were believed to meddle in dark [[magic]] by the [[Rohirrim]].<ref name=\"UTIsen\"/>\n\nThe attention of the [[Stewards of Gondor]] eventually turned eastwards and their emissaries to Isengard eventually ceased completely. In their neglect they  did not realise that the line of Gondorian chieftains had failed. The people had long intermingled with the [[Dunlendings]], enemies of the Rohirrim, and became more friendly to them than to the 'wild Northmen'. [[Hill-men]] of [[Dunland]] were allowed to settle in and around Isengard. They seized control of the fortress and slew any of the ancient Isengard guards who were unwilling to merge with them. During the reign of [[King of Rohan|King]] [[Déor]] they became openly hostile to the Rohirrim. Déor could not besiege Isengard and [[Egalmoth]], the Steward of Gondor, was unable to send help. Instead Déor kept a strong force of riders in the north of the [[Westfold]].<ref name=\"UTIsen\"/> The occupation lasted through the reign of King [[Gram]].<ref name=\"AppA2\"/>\n\nAt the time of King [[Helm]]'s reign in {{TA|2758}}, the exiled lord [[Wulf]] led the Dundlendings into a great invasion of Rohan. Despite impressive victories, they were eventually defeated by the Rohirrim. The Dunlendings who occupied Isengard suffered considerably in the [[Long Winter]]. They capitulated and were driven out by Helm's nephew, [[Fréaláf]] (soon to be the new King of Rohan) near the end of {{TA|2759}}.<ref name=\"UTIsen\"/><ref name=\"AppA2\">{{App|A2}}</ref>\n\n====Saruman's domain====\nWhen the [[Istari|Wizard]] [[Saruman]] returned from his travels into the east of [[Middle-earth]], he offered to make Isengard his home and to lend his help  in defending the West. As both Gondor and Rohan suffered from the Long Winter and wars, the Wizard Saruman was welcomed by King Fréaláf and Steward [[Beren (Steward of Gondor)|Beren]] alike with open arms. In {{TA|2759}},<ref name=\"AppStewards\">{{App|Stewards}}</ref> The valley in which Isengard resided soon became known as \"[[Nan Curunír]]\", the \"Valley of Saruman\" or the \"Wizard's Vale\".<ref name=\"TTTreebeard\">{{TT|Treebeard}}</ref><ref name=\"TTRoad\">{{TT|Road}}</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|2953}},<ref group=\"note\">''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', entry \"Isengard\" incorrectly gives the date {{TA|2963}}.</ref> following the last meeting of the [[White Council]], the Wizard took Isengard for his own as [[Lord of Isengard]], and fortified it.<ref name=\"AppStewards\"/><ref name=\"AppTA\">{{App|TA}}</ref> Around {{TA| 2990}}, [[Orcs]] began mustering and breeding in muddy pits tunneled within the ringed walls.<ref name=\"UTP\"/> With the corrupted Wizard suborned by the [[Dark Lord]] through the ''[[palantír]]'',<ref name=\"AppTA\">{{App|TA}}</ref> Isengard became a nominal fiefdom of [[Mordor]], as Saruman wished to share in Sauron's power by either aiding his victory or retrieving the [[One Ring]] first.<ref name=\"FRCouncil\">{{FR|Council}}</ref>\n\nOn [[10 July]], {{TA|3018}}, Gandalf arrived at Isengard, having been summoned there by Saruman.<ref name=\"AppGreat\">{{App|Great}}</ref> The corrupted Wizard revealed his true colours and demanded that the Grey Pilgrim submit to him or to the Dark Lord. Gandalf refused both choices and was imprisoned atop [[Orthanc]]. From the pinnacle of the tower Gandalf could see that Isengard had been transformed; in place of trees and grass were pits and forges, and Saruman was assembling  [[Orcs of Isengard|his Orcs]] and [[Wolves]] into an army both in service and in rivalry of Sauron.<ref name=\"FRCouncil\">{{FR|Council}}</ref> On [[18 September]], {{TA|3018}}, Gandalf was borne away by [[Gwaihir]] the [[eagles|eagle]].<ref name=\"AppGreat\"/>\n\nBelieving that Saruman knew the location of the One Ring, Sauron sent the [[Nazgûl]] to Isengard. The [[Witch-king]] arrived at the gate of Isengard two days after Gandalf's escape (or, according to a different account, on the very day of his escape). But the Lord of [[Minas Morgul|Morgul]] and his company did not have the strength to assault Isengard. The Nazgûl departed after Saruman told them that he believed Gandalf knew the whereabouts of the Ring and suggested they seek him out.<ref name=\"UTHunt\">{{UT|Hunt}}</ref>\n\nIsengard became Saruman's base of operations during the [[War of the Ring]]. His war with [[Rohan]] began on [[25 February]], {{TA|3019}}, with the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]]. The forces of Isengard were victorious and the Wizard Saruman's main objective, the killing of Prince [[Théodred]] (son of King [[Théoden]]), was achieved. With another victory at the [[Second Battle of the Fords of Isen]] on [[2 March]], the legions of Isengard won passage into the plains of Rohan and marched onwards to [[Helm's Deep]], suffering utter defeat in the [[Battle of the Hornburg]] (on [[3 March]]).<ref name=\"UTIsen\"/><ref name=\"AppGreat\"/>\n\n[[File:Jef Murray - After the Flood.jpg|thumb|[[Jef Murray]] - ''After the Flood'']]\n{{Blockquote|My business is with Isengard tonight, with rock and stone.|[[Treebeard]]<ref name=\"TTFlotsam\"/>}}\n\nOn 2 March, the [[Battle of Isengard]] began when the [[Ents]] of [[Fangorn Forest]] began their attack on the unprotected Isengard.<ref name=\"AppGreat\"/> They overran the Orcs and vile Men therein, but were unable to assail the tower of Orthanc.<ref name=\"TTFlotsam\"/>\n\nOn [[5 March]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], now the \"doorwardens\" of Isengard, welcomed [[Théoden]], [[Éomer]], [[Gandalf]], [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], and [[Gimli]].<ref name=\"TTRoad\"/> They parleyed with Saruman, but he refused to co-operate and was so left locked in Orthanc until the defeat of his master, Sauron.<ref name=\"TTVoice\">{{TT|Voice}}</ref>\n\nOn [[22 August]], {{TA|3019}},<ref name=\"AppB3\">{{App|B3}}</ref> Treebeard, now in charge of what remained of the ringed fortress,<ref name=\"TTRoad\"/> allowed Saruman and [[Gríma]] to depart from Isengard. Before they went, they handed over the keys of Orthanc. This Treebeard told to Gandalf and company when they travelled through Isengard on their journey home.<ref name=\"RKPartings\">{{RK|Partings}}</ref>\n\n====Treegarth and the Fourth Age====\n{{main|Treegarth of Orthanc}}\nFollowing the Battle of Isengard in which the [[Ring of Isengard]] was destroyed, the Ents filled the land with gardens of orchards and trees. A stream ran into a small clear lake, in the middle of which stood the black-stone tower of Orthanc. Whilst the Treegarth of Orthanc became part of the [[Reunited Kingdom]], [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] granted the Ents complete self-governance of what was formerly Isengard.<ref name=\"RKPartings\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Isengard'' means \"Iron-enclosure\" in [[Old English]] (see also [[Isen]]): \"''It was so called because of the great hardness of the stone in that place and especially in the central tower of Orthanc.''\"<ref name=\"Nomen\">{{HM|N}}, p. 772</ref>\n\n''Isen'' is a variant form of Old English ''iren'' 'iron.' 'Gard' is a modernization of Old English ''geard'' meaning 'enclosure,' which occurs in Old English ''Middangeard'', the equivalent of Old Norse ''Midgard'', both of which mean the world of Men. Through misunderstanding, ''Middangeard'' became ''Middanerd'' > 'Middle-earth.' The name ''Isengard'' represents a [[Westron]] translation of [[Sindarin]] ''Angrenost''.<ref name=\"Nomen\"/>\n\n'''''Angrenost''''' is [[Sindarin]] for \"Iron Fortress\",<ref name=\"SIndex\">{{S|Index}}, entry \"Angrenost\"</ref> from ''[[anga|angren]]'' (\"of iron\") + ''[[ost]]'' (\"fort, stronghold, enclosure\").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entries ''[[anga]]'', ''[[ost]]''</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Isengard in Adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"225px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:War in Middle Earth - Orcs and Uruk-hai at Isengard.png| Isengard in ''[[J.R.R.
