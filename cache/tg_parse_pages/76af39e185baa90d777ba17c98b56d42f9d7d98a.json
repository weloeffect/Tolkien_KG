Ha!''' is the second track on ''[[The Hobbit: The Complete Original Soundtrack]]'', with its reprise being the twelfth track. They were respectively adapted from the poems \"[[O! What are you doing,]]\" and \"[[The dragon is withered]]\" from ''[[The Hobbit]]''. While sung by [[Glenn Yarbrough]] on the soundtrack, the version that appears in the [[1977]] [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|film adaptation]] is sung by the cast members. The reprise, however, is sung by the cast members in both the film ''and'' on the soundtrack.\n\n==Lyrics==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nOh, what are you doing,\nAnd where are you going?\nYour [[Ponies|ponies]] need shoeing,\nThe river is flowing!\nOh, tra-la-la-lally\nHere down in [[Rivendell|the valley]], ha! ha!\n\nOh, where are you going\nWith beards all a-wagging?\nNo knowing, no knowing,\nWhat brings [[Bilbo Baggins|Mr. Baggins]],\nAnd [[Balin]] and [[Dwalin]]\nIn June? in the valley, ha! ha!\n\nOh, will you be staying,\nOr will you be flying?\nYour ponies are straying!\nThe daylight is dying!\n\nTo fly would be folly,\nTo stay would be jolly.\nTra-lil-lil-lil-lolly, ha! ha!\n\nOh, what are you doing,\nAnd where are you going?\nYour ponies need shoeing,\nThe river is flowing!\nOh, tra-la-la-lally\nHere down in the valley, ha! ha!\n</poem>\n\n'''REPRISE:'''\n\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\n[[Smaug|The dragon]] is withered,\nHis bones are now crumbled.\nHis armour is shrivered,\nHis splendour is humbled!\nOh, tra-la-la-lally\nHere down in the valley, ha! ha!\n\nThough sword shall be rusted,\nAnd throne and crown perish\nWith strength that [[Men]] trusted,\nAnd wealth that they cherish,\nOh, tra-la-la-lally\nHere down in the valley, ha! ha!\n\nThe stars are far brighter\nThan gems without measure,\nThe moon is far whiter\nThan silver in treasure\n\nThe leaves are yet swinging,\nAnd [[Elves]] are yet singing,\nCome back to the valley, ha! ha!\n\nOh, where are you going,\nSo late in returning?\nThe river is flowing,\nThe stars are all burning!\nOh, tra-la-la-lally\nHere down in the valley, ha! ha!\n</poem>\n\n[[Category:The Hobbit (1977 film) soundtrack]]"}}}
