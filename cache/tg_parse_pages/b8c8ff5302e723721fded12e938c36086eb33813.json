''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]'') and the later (''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''). \n\nFor example the theory suggests that the ''Book of Lost Tales'' should be understood to have happened in the Middle Ages, long after the prehistorical happenings of the books; the [[Qenya]] and [[Gnomish|Goldogrin]] words and names are medieval evolution of the \"earlier\" [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]] of the [[Elder Days]].\n\nAll inconsistencies can be dismissed by crediting them to errors or misunderstandings of the copyists, including [[Eriol]].\n\n==External links==\n*[http://lambenore.free.fr/downloads/jrrtgt.pdf Essay] by David Giraudeau\n[[Category:Debates]]\n[[Category:Fanon]]\n[[Category:Tolkien studies]]"}}}
