Merry told them how the whole forest had marched to Isengard and torn up the gates. Pippin then told them how [[Saruman]] had almost managed to escape but had been spotted in time and taken refuge in the stronghold of [[Orthanc]] that even the iron-tearing ents could not destroy. He also told them how [[Gandalf]] had come by and asked for [[Treebeard]]'s help, which he had given. Pippin told them how [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]] had come to give Saruman a message, but seeing the destruction he had wanted to leave. At that point Treebeard had captured him and that was how he had come to be cloistered with Saruman.\n==Composition==\nTolkien wrote this chapter, along with the five final chapter of Book III were writen as a whole (not in consequence) during his spare time in summer and autumn [[1942]]. He wrote three versions of Merry's monologue on [[pipe-weed]]. Eventually, while making a fair copy, much of Merry's speech was removed to form a separate text, \"[[Concerning Pipe-weed]]\".<ref>{{CG|CG}}, p. xxiv</ref>\n{{references}}\n[[fi:Hylkytavaraa (TSH)]]\n[[Category:The Two Towers chapters]]"}}}
