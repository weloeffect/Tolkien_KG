He worried that he was a burden to the Rohirrim, and he felt unwanted and small. While the group rested, the Riders encountered the [[Drúedain|Woses]], the Wild Men of the Woods. Troubled by [[Orcs]], the Woses offered their services to [[Théoden]]. They were a little-known yet ancient people, stumpy and brutish. The Woses' leader [[Ghân-buri-Ghân]], informed [[Théoden]] that all roads to Minas Tirith were blocked, save the secret ways the Woses knew. The Wild Men promised to show the Riders through these paths, though they would not fight alongside [[Rohan]].\n\nThe Riders emerged from the forest just north of Minas Tirith, and the Woses bade them farewell and vanished. To Théoden's dismay, the Riders discovered two dead bodies, one of them the earlier messenger from [[Gondor]], still clutching the red arrow.<ref>{{RK|Muster}}</ref> Apparently, Minas Tirith did not know the Riders were coming to its aid. Dernhelm, still carrying Merry, broke rank and drew closer to Théoden as the Riders reached the out-walls of Gondor.\n\nThéoden looked sadly upon the destruction of Minas Tirith.<ref>{{RK|Siege}}</ref> Suddenly, a great flash of light sprang from the city with a booming sound. Reinvigorated, Théoden commanded his Riders into battle with a great cry: \"More clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve.\" The singing Rohirrim routed the Orcs and armies of Mordor. The Darkness dissipated with a fresh wind from the sea.\n\nAt the arrival of the Rohirrim, the [[Witch-king]] sensed the Darkness fading and the tide of battle turning. He vanished from the city gate to enter the fray. Meanwhile, Théoden rode in fury ahead of the Rohirrim. The chieftain of the [[Haradrim|Southrons]]—allies of [[Mordor]]—led his men against Théoden. Though outnumbered, Théoden and [[Éomer]] charged through the line of enemy scimitars handily, striking down the Southrons’ chieftain.\n{{references}}\n[[Category:The Return of the King chapters|Ride of the Rohirrim]]\n[[fi:Rohirrimin ratsastus (TSH)]]"}}}
