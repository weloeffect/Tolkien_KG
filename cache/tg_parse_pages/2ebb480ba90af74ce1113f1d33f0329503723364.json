He was with his captain when the ship [[Vingilot]] made its epic journey into the distant [[Aman|West]], to reach the [[Blessed Realm]] itself. \n\nWhile [[Eärendil]] and [[Elwing]] journeyed ashore, Falathar remained aboard the ship with his fellows [[Erellont]] and [[Aerandir]]. After Eärendil had delivered his embassy to the [[Valar]], their emissary [[Eönwë]] came to the three mariners and set them in another boat. The Valar sent a wind out of the west to blow Falathar and his companions back across the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] and, presumably, they landed again somewhere in [[Middle-earth]], though their ultimate fate is not recorded.<ref>{{S|24}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Falathar'' contains [[Sindarin]] ''[[falas]]'' (\"shore, line of surf\").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}</ref> The ending is not explained, but a relationship to ''[[thar-]]'' \"across, over, beyond\" is not inconceivable.\n\n== Theories ==\n[[J.R.R.
