They are described as \"crystals hung in a fine chain net, the crystals being ever shining with an inner blue radiance\". The lamps were created in [[Valinor]] and the flame could not be extinguished by wind or water. The [[Noldor]] were famous for the flames, but unfortunately the craft was lost with them. [[Gelmir (messenger of Círdan)|Gelmir]] possessed one of these lamps when he met [[Tuor]].<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>\n\nSome of the Noldor who had been captured by [[Morgoth]] and put to work in his mines had Fëanorian lamps with them. [[Gwindor]] was one of these enslaved Elves, and when he escaped he took with him one of these lamps.<ref name=\"CH9\">{{CH|9}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Tuor, Gelmir, and Arminas.jpg|thumb|right|190px|\"Tuor, Gelmir, and Arminas\" by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\n\nIn the [[Third Age]], the [[Galadhrim|Elves of Lothlórien]] used similar devices: small lamps that gave out slender silver beams.<ref>{{FR|Lorien}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nThe lamps were part of the [[legendarium]] from very early stages, but [[Christopher Tolkien]] did not mention them in the published ''[[Silmarillion]]''. For example, in one version of the story, [[Túrin Turambar]] recognised the face of [[Beleg]] whom he had slain by the light of Gwindor's lamp;<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}, p. 51, note 2</ref> yet in the version included in the ''Silmarillion'', it was lightning which revealed Beleg's face to Túrin.<ref name=\"CH9\"/>\n\nA detailed description of the nature of the lamps is described in the early ''[[Lay of the Children of Húrin]]'', when Beleg finds Gwindor in the forest of [[Taur-nu-Fuin (Dorthonion)|Taur-nu-Fuin]] after seeing his lamp shining in the distance:\n\n{{blockquote|But little lanterns &nbsp;&nbsp;of lucent crystal<br />\nand silver cold &nbsp;&nbsp;with subtlest cunning<br />\nthey strangely fashioned, &nbsp;&nbsp;and steadfast a flame<br />\nburnt unblinking &nbsp;&nbsp;there blue and pale,<br />\nunquenched for ever. &nbsp;&nbsp;The craft that lit them<br />\nwas the jewel-makers' &nbsp;&nbsp;most jealous secret.<br />\nNot Morgoth's might, &nbsp;&nbsp;nor meed nor torment<br />\nthem vowed, availed &nbsp;&nbsp;to reveal that lore;<br />\nyet lights and lamps &nbsp;&nbsp;of living radiance,<br />\nmany and magical, &nbsp;&nbsp;they made for him.<br />\nNo dark could dim them &nbsp;&nbsp;the deeps wandering;<br />\nwhose lode they lit &nbsp;&nbsp;was lost seldom<br />\nin groundless grot, &nbsp;&nbsp;or gulfs far under.|''[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]'', II.
