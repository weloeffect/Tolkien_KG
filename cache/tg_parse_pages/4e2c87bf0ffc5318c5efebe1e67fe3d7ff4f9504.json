[[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] rejected this idea because the Ruffians could too easily hem them in and then smoke them out. Eventually the [[Hobbits]] decided on more direct action.<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn the manuscript for ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' Sam's suggestion to take the South Lane to the Cotton's farm was accepted. The Travellers went to the farm and the wary Cottons let them in. A fight broke out and six ruffians were killed. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] rewrote this episode so that no ruffians were killed at the farm, instead the hobbits were trapped and planned to burst out. At this point [[Christopher Tolkien]] said his father realized that he had taken a wrong turning; there was no credible way for the hobbits to burst out unscathed.<ref name=\"Scouring\"/>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''\n:The Cotton family live on 3 South Lane, a house near the edge of Bywater.\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Roads and streets]]\n[[Category:The Shire]]\n[[fi:Eteläkuja]]"}}}
