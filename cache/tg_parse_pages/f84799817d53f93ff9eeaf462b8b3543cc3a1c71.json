They existed throughout the history of [[Middle-earth]] among different peoples and cultures.\n\n==History==\n===First Age===\nThe [[Noldor]] used horsed archers during the [[First Age]]. [[Fingon]], the prince of [[Hithlum]], rode against the young [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Glaurung]] with a company of horse archers and forced him to flee back to [[Angband]].<ref>{{Cite DTP|S QS.13.033}}</ref> Later horsed archers of Fingon pursued [[orcs]], that had been defeated in the battle in Hithlum, into the [[Iron Mountains]].<ref name=\"Fingon\">{{Cite DTP|S QS.18.028}}</ref> [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]] also had many horsed archers. They were defeated in the [[battle of the Pass of Aglon]],<ref>{{WJ|P1}}: §145-148</ref> but the hosts of [[Morgoth]] suffered great casualties in that battle.<ref name=\"Fingon\" />\n\n===Second Age===\nThe [[Númenóreans|Númenóreans]] shot bows from horseback as a sport and pastime during the [[Second Age]],<ref>{{Cite DTP|UT 2.01.015}}</ref> but they did not ride on horses to war. However, units of light-armed horsed archers (often of non-Númenórean origin) existed within Númenórean armies.<ref>{{Cite DTP|UT 3.01}}</ref>\n\nDuring the same time period [[Northmen]], who were skilled and fearless riders, well-armed due to a close [[Alliance of Dwarves and Men|alliance]] with [[Dwarves]], used great forces of horsed archers to fight against [[Orcs|Orc]] raids.<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref>\n\n===Third Age===\nIn the [[Third Age]] horsed archers were used by the [[Éothéod|Éotheod]] and by their descendants, the [[Rohirrim]]. The great [[Éoherë|''éoherë'']] led by [[Eorl]] to the [[battle of the Field of Celebrant]] included several hundreds of horsed archers. After the battle some companies of horsed archers remained in [[Calenardhon]] to deal with bands of enemies that might still lurk there.<ref>{{Cite DTP|UT 3.02.03}}</ref> During the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen|First battle of the Fords of Isen]] [[Théodred|Théodred]] had at least one company of horsed archers.<ref>{{Cite DTP|UT 3.05.005}}</ref> Some riders of [[Éomer|Éomer]]'s ''[[éored]]'' were skilled at shooting from a running horse. They were able to shoot many Orcs during the pursuit of [[Uglúk|Uglúk]]'s company.<ref>{{Cite DTP|LR 3.03.091}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[War of the Ring]], [[Frodo]] saw a vision from [[Amon Hen]] of horsed archers among the armies of the [[Easterlings]].<ref>{{Cite DTP|LR 2.10.055}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Military]]"}}}
