It appears only in [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s ''[[Eärendillinwë]]'' at [[Rivendell]],<ref>{{FR|II1}}</ref> and so the term may have been meant as Bilbo's own invention. In the poem, it's described as being a land of hills and fountains.\n\n[[Galadriel's Song]] mentions a similar term: ''Beneath the stars of Ever-eve in [[Eldamar]] it shone.''\n\nThe name seems to be a reference to the land of [[Valinor]],<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry \"Evereven\"</ref> though its precise identity is difficult to pin down. \n==Meaning==\nIn the original conception, Eärendil undertook an epic journey carrying him on a cycle from Evereven through [[Evernight]], [[Evernoon]] and [[Evermorn]]. Much of this was lost from the final form of the song, so that while the names Evereven and Evernight both survived into [[The Lord of the Rings]], their context and meaning have become difficult to identify.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Regions]]\n[[Category:Aman]]\n[[fi:Iki-ilta]]"}}}
