The object from [[Faery]] was eaten by [[Smith Smithson]].\n\nYears later, [[Nokes]], who had been the [[Master Cook]] at that feast, speculated about who had swallowed the Fay-star. He remembered Molly, the Miller's daughter, claiming that she had been greedy and bolted down her food, and later had become as fat as a sack. [[Alf]], who had been Nokes' apprentice, disputed this.  He noted that Molly had found two trinkets in her slice and therefore could not have eaten the star.<ref>{{SOWM|Smith}}</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Smith of Wootton Major]]"}}}
