Steve Walker, a Professor of English at [[wikipedia:Brigham Young University|Brigham Young University]] explores the fiction, essays, and letters of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] to explore the variations on Tolkien's prose and mastery of language.\n==From the publisher==\n{{Blockquote|'''Shortlisted for the 2011 Mythopoeic Scholarship Award for Inklings Studies''' <br><br>\n\nTolkien's unparalleled popularity has been largely attributed to his gifts as a storyteller and his thematic currency. But [[The Lord of the Rings]] may have become a modern classic for a deeper reason than we've noticed: Tolkien is a first-rate stylist. The Power of Tolkien's Prose illuminates the multifaceted appeal of Tolkien's prose style in dimensions ranging from his fantastic realism to his revitalizing imagery to his dynamic narrative to his expansive characterization to his engaging language. Viewed through the lens of Steve Walker's stylistic appreciation, Tolkien's fiction emerges as a new dimension of perception.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7816016-the-power-of-tolkien-s-prose?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=mQFHxqHQHy&rank=1|articlename=The Power of Tolkien's Prose: Middle-Earth's Magical Style|dated=|website=[https://www.goodreads.com/?ref=nav_hom Goodreads]|accessed=}}</ref>}}\n\n{{references}}\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Publications with contribution by J.R.R.
