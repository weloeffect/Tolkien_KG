In {{YT|1115}}<ref name=\"Annals\">{{AA|60-2}}</ref> the Elves travelled through [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]] and reached the river [[Anduin]]. The [[Teleri]] stayed on the eastern side of the river for a long time and were afraid of the [[Misty Mountains]]. The [[Vanyar]] and the [[Noldor]] crossed the river and travelled over passes of the Misty Mountains with help from [[Oromë]]. A numerous part of the Teleri under the leadership of [[Lenwë]] abandoned] the march to the west, went [[Sundering of the Elves|away]] south down the river and became known as the [[Nandor]]. The rest of the Teleri continued their march to the west and passed over the Misty Mountains.<ref>{{S|Captivity}}</ref>\n\nAfter the awakening of the Elves the ancestors of the [[Longbeards|Longbeard]] [[Dwarves]] awoke at [[Mount Gundabad]] at the northern end of the Misty Mountains. They expanded east to the [[Iron Hills]] where they mined for iron-ore and southwards down the [[Vales of Anduin]] where they founded their chief underground city [[Moria]] further south in the Misty Mountains. They also considered the Grey Mountains and the east vales of the Misty Mountains as their territory.<ref name=relations>{{PM|Relations}}, pp. 302-303</ref>\n\nAfter they had [[Awakening of Men|awakened]] in [[Hildórien]] in the far east of Middle-earth, some groups of [[Men]] travelled through Rhovanion on their way to the west of Middle-earth until they reached Greenwood the Great and then split into different groups. Some of them passed between the northern edge of Greenwood the Great and the Grey Mountains. Others passed south of the southern edge of Greenwood the Great until they reached the river Anduin and then migrated to the north up the Vales of Anduin. Only a small part of them moved on to Eriador and Beleriand. Most of those Men that remained in the north of Rhovanion were related to the House of Hador and became known as the Northmen. They were skilled riders and mostly lived in scattered farms, villages and small townships, which were fortified by wooden fences and dikes at best. The Longbeard Dwarves soon started to trade tools, weapons, arms and other items that required a lot of skill or were costly was well and their services as builders, miners and roadmakers in exchange for food produced by Men as farmers and herdsmen.<ref name=relations/>\n\nThe [[Orcs]] stopped harassing the region when most were concentrated to the [[Battles of Beleriand|War of the Jewels]] in [[Beleriand]], and Rhovanion existed in relative peace;<ref name=relations/> it was not otherwise mentioned until the [[Second Age]].\n\n=== Second Age ===\nAfter the destruction of [[Angband]] in the [[War of Wrath]], large well-armed hordes of Orcs fled to the east in search of new homes and attacked the Longbeard Dwarves. Initially the Men of Rhovanion were only lightly armed, primarily with bows, because they had little metal and only had few unskilled smiths. Early in the Second Age, the Longbeard Dwarves who were outnumbered by the Orcs formed an alliance with the Men of Rhovanion and provided them with arms and armour made from metal in exchange for the aid in the fight against the Orcs. The Men of Rhovanion acted as mounted scouts that kept watch for the movements of Orcs. Whenever they discovered groups of Orcs they gathered a large troop of mounted archers, surrounded them and destroyed them.<ref name=relations/> For many lives of Men the territory of the Longbeards included the east side of the Misty Mountains to the edge of [[Lothlórien]], the Grey Mountains, the [[Lonely Mountain]] and the Iron Hills. Then Men of Rhovanion lived adjacent to them all the way to the south to the [[Old Forest Road]] that led through Greenwood the Great to the Iron Hills.<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, note 30</ref>\n\nRhovanion played host to two [[Silvan Elves|Silvan]] Elf kingdoms ruled by [[Sindar]]in lords: Northern Greenwood and Lórinand (or [[Lothlórien|Lórien]]).\n\nThe great battlefield (or [[Dagorlad]]) of the [[War of the Last Alliance]] against the host of [[Sauron]] lay in the south of Rhovanion, and in the [[Gladden Fields]] of the Great River the High King of Gondor and [[Arnor]], [[Isildur]], son of [[Elendil]], was killed.\n\n=== Third Age ===\nSometime around {{TA|1050}}, due to the darkness around [[Dol Guldur]], the [[Harfoots]] left the [[Vales of Anduin]] westwards, beginning the [[Wandering Days]]. The [[Fallohides]] would follow, but the [[Stoors]] remained until {{TA|1150}}. Some Stoors would continue to dwell in the vales of the Anduin until at least the late Third Age.\n\nIn the mid-13th century there were many northern princes, the most prominent of them being [[Vidugavia]], who ruled between [[Mirkwood]] and the [[River Running]], although he called himself \"[[King of Rhovanion]]\"<ref name=\"AppGondor\">{{App|Gondor}}</ref> About this time [[Regent]] [[Minalcar]] of [[Gondor]] led a great expedition into Rhovanion in {{TA|1248}} and utterly defeated the [[Easterlings]], with substantial help from the [[Northmen]] and from Vidugavia in particular. Vidugavia became Gondor's strong ally.<ref name=\"AppGondor\"/>\n\nIn {{TA|1248}}, [[Rómendacil II]], who as Minalcar served as Regent to his uncle of [[Atanatar II]] of Gondor, destroyed all camps of the Easterlings even beyond the [[Sea of Rhûn]], and a strong alliance with Rhovanion was forged. The King of Rhovanion at this time was [[Vidugavia]] - ruling the lands between [[Mirkwood]] and the [[River Running]]<ref name=\"AppGondor\"/> - and Prince [[Valacar]] of Gondor served in his army and integrated with their culture. Vidugavia's daughter [[Vidumavi]] married Valacar, and their son Vinitharya became King [[Eldacar (King of Gondor)|Eldacar]] in {{TA|1432|n}}, which led to the [[Kin-strife]] in {{TA|1437|n}}. Eldacar fled to Rhovanion, and with a Rhovanion army, he reclaimed his Kingdom in {{TA|1447|n}}.\n\nIn {{TA|1636}}, the [[Great Plague]] devastated Rhovanion, killing more than half its people. This left Rhovanion weakened, and in {{TA|1851|n}} the [[Wainriders]] overran and enslaved Rhovanion. For 43 years Rhovanion was enslaved, but in {{TA|1899|n}} Rhovanion revolted, while Gondor attacked the Wainriders from the west. Rhovanion was freed but left extremely weakened. Many Men of Rhovanion left for Gondor, where they were welcomed as distant relatives.\n\nIn {{TA|1851}}, the [[Battle of the Plains]] was fought by Gondor and the Northmen against the Wainriders; [[Narmacil II|King Narmacil II]] of Gondor and the Northman [[Marhari]] (a descendant of Vidugavia)<ref name=\"Cirion\">{{UT|Northmen}}</ref> were both killed in this battle.<ref group=note>The [[Lord of the Eotheod|Lords of the Eotheod]] claimed descent from the '...kings of Rhovanion, whose realm lay beyond Mirkwood before the invasions of the Wainriders...' according to Appendix A to ''''The Lord of the Rings''''.</ref> Refugees from this defeat were reorganized as the [[Éothéod]] on the other side of Mirkwood in the lower [[Vales of Anduin]], under the leadership of [[Marhwini]], son of Marhari.<ref name=\"Cirion\"/> Many of the Northmen remained in their old lands as a subject people of the Wainriders. Others fled north, with some mingling with the [[Men of Dale|people of Dale]].<ref name=\"Cirion\"/>\n\n====Later history====\nIn the later Third Age, in the north lay the [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] kingdoms of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] and the Dwarf halls in the Ered Mithrin, the kingdom of [[Dale]], and in the north of the great river [[Anduin]] lay the realm of the [[Éothéod]]. In the north of Greenwood lived the Silvan Elves ruled by [[Thranduil]], and in the south of Greenwood and across the river in Lórinand ruled [[Amdír]] and later [[Amroth]]. In the far south, near the great falls of [[Sarn Gebir]], watched the northern guard of [[Gondor]], and in the valleys of the Anduin lived Stoors.\n\nIn around {{TA|2460}}, [[Sauron]] returned as the Necromancer he took residence at [[Dol Guldur]] in the south of Greenwood. And Greenwood became evil and was renamed Mirkwood. The Dwarves of Erebor and the Men of Dale were destroyed and scattered when the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Smaug]] took Erebor, and Gondor retreated from the Falls. Some Men still lived along the forest, notably the [[Beornings]] and the Men of [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]] upon the [[Long Lake]]. The Men of Éothéod removed south at the invite of Gondor and settled the plains of [[Calenardhon]], later [[Rohan]]. After being driven out of Erebor the Dwarves relocated, some went to the Iron Hills, but most went to the [[Ered Luin]] in [[Eriador]].\n\nAt the end of the Third Age, the Kingdoms of Erebor and Dale were restored as a result of the death of Smaug and the [[Battle of Five Armies]], and Sauron was removed from Mirkwood by the wizard [[Gandalf]]. During the [[War of the Ring]], it held off an invasion by Sauron's forces, and after Sauron was defeated Mirkwood was clean again, and renamed ''Eryn Lasgalen'', or \"Wood of Greenleaves\". Some time during the [[Fourth Age]], the [[Reunited Kingdom]] claimed large parts of it.<ref name=\"AppGondor\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Rhovanion'' (more correctly ''Rhovennian''<ref name=Rhoven>{{PE|23b}}, p. 136</ref>) is [[Sindarin]] for \"Wilderland\", consisting of ''[[rhovan]]'' (\"wild\")<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, p. 78, entry \"Rhovanion\"</ref> and the ending for names of regions ''[[-ion]]''.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 42, entry \"Eregion\"; and p. 37, entry \"Azanul-bizar\"</ref>\n\nMore specifically, the Sindarin term ''rhovan'' referred to large beasts, especially the great red [[deer]] who lived in the Vales of Anduin and western Mirkwood.<ref name=Rhoven/>\n\n''Wilderland'' is the translation of ''Rhovanion'' into the [[Common Speech]],<ref name=PE17/> which was also used by [[Hobbits]].<ref name=UI/> [[J.R.R.
