Your parcel arrived safely, but it arrived at a crowded time, and I was also unwell. In fact, I had to go away to recuperate, and only returned yesterday. It was on my conscience that I had gone off without either returning your books or letting you know. I will send them off, I hope on Friday. Why not at once? Well, because tomorrow [[Edith Tolkien|my wife]] and I celebrate our 40th or ruby wedding anniversary, and are preparing for the gathering of our children and children-in-law, which has not occurred complete for many years. I fear it will be a ceremony by [[The Shire|Shire]] standards ‘brief, moderate, simple, and jejune’ but there may be a speech!<br/><br/>Yours truly, J. R. R. Tolkien<br/><br/>P.S.
