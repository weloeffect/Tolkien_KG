The tower was carved out of the living rock of the mountain and stood upon a high eyrie. The [[Endless Stair]] led to the tower from the foundations of the mountain.<ref name=\"White\">{{TT|III5}}, p. 502</ref>\n\nBy the end of the [[Third Age]], Durin's Tower had long been lost. Some Dwarves believed it had been destroyed, while others thought it was only a legend. On [[23 January]] {{TA|3019}}, [[Gandalf]] and the [[Durin's Bane|Balrog]] climbed the Endless Stair to Durin's Tower. Upon the Silvertine they [[Battle of the Peak|fought]] until Gandalf defeated the [[Balrogs|demon]] [[25 January|two days later]].<ref>{{App|Great}}, p. 1092</ref> During the battle, the tower was destroyed and the entrance to the stair was blocked.<ref name=\"White\"/>\n\n{{references}}\n{{LegendLoc}}\n[[Category:Moria]]\n[[Category:Towers]]\n[[de:Durins Turm]]\n[[fi:Durinin Torni]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/villes tours et forteresses/monts brumeux/tour de durin]]"}}}
