Lewis]], [[Tolkien]] once told him that the historical people in a sense did not falsely claim to see \"[[nymphs]] in the fountains and woods and dryads in the wood\", since the production of food was closely connected to one's own land and territory: people came to internalize the nature surrounding them.<ref>[[C.S.
