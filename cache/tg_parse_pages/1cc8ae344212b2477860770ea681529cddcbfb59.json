The [[Noldor]] could hear their singing from across the river Gelion, and named the country [[Lindon]], the land of music.<ref>{{S|14}}</ref>\n\nThingol called upon Denethor for aid after being assailed by [[Orcs]], and Denethor led a group of Elves from Ossiriand and joined in the [[First Battle of Beleriand]]. Denethor's people were lightly armed and no match for the Orcs. Although the Elves had the victory, Denethor and many of the Elves that followed him from Ossiriand were slain. Those that returned to Ossiriand brought tidings of fear, and the Green-elves went never again to open war. Many fled to [[Doriath]] and joined Thingol's people there, and those remaining in Ossiriand took to secrecy and chose no more kings.<ref name=Sindar/><ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, p. 263 (§114)</ref>\n\n[[Finrod Felagund]], a lord of the [[Noldor]], visited Ossiriand at times, and befriended the Green-elves.<ref name=Sindar/> In the days of the [[Long Peace]], he crossed into Ossiriand and discovered a camp of [[Men]] in a valley there, led by [[Bëor the Old]]. Felagund went among them, and learned that more Men were also journeying westward. The Green-elves were troubled by the coming of Men into their land, and upon their request Felagund advised Bëor to relocate his people. The people of Bëor obliged and removed to [[Estolad]] in the lands of [[Amrod]] and [[Amras]].<ref>{{S|17}}</ref>\n\nIn the following centuries of the [[First Age]], Ossiriand suffered little from the [[Battles of Beleriand]]. Following the [[Dagor Bragollach]] and the breaking of the [[Siege of Angband]], some of the [[Grey-elves]] fled to Ossiriand. [[Caranthir]], Amrod, and Amras maintained a watch on [[Amon Ereb]] with the help of the Green-elves, and Orcs came not into Ossiriand.<ref>{{S|18}}</ref> After the return of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] from the dead, they crossed into Ossiriand and stayed in [[Dor Firn-i-Guinar]] on [[Tol Galen]], an island located in the river [[Adurant]].<ref>{{S|20}}</ref> After the death of [[Thingol]], the [[Dwarves of Nogrod]] tried to return home with the treasure of [[Menegroth]]; but they were waylaid by Beren, leading an army of Green-elves of Ossiriand. The Dwarves were slain, or fled and were driven by [[Ents]] into the woods of the [[Ered Luin]]. The treasure was cast into the River [[Ascar]].<ref>{{S|22}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the [[War of Wrath]], much of Beleriand sank, and the Ered Luin were broken, allowing the [[Great Sea|Sea]] to flow through and form the [[Gulf of Lhûn]]. Ossiriand, which remained above the sea, was ever afterwards called [[Lindon]].<ref name=Rings/>\n\nFor its later history, see '''[[Lindon]]'''.\n\n==Geography==\nThe Land of Seven Rivers lay between the River [[Gelion]] and the [[Blue Mountains]]. It was so named because Gelion and its six tributaries watered the lands. The Seven Rivers were, from north to south:<ref name=GA1350/>\n#River ''[[Gelion]]''\n#River ''[[Ascar]]'' or ''Rathlóriel''\n#River ''[[Thalos]]''\n#River ''[[Legolin]]''\n#River ''[[Brilthor]]''\n#River ''[[Duilwen]]''\n#River ''[[Adurant]]'', with [[Tol Galen]]\n\nNorth of Ossiriand lay the land of [[Thargelion]], and south of the river Adurant later lay [[Dor Firn-i-Guinar]]. Along the northern shore of the Ascar ran the [[Dwarf-road of Beleriand|Dwarf-road]] to [[Nogrod]].\n\n==Etymology==\n''Ossiriand'' is [[Sindarin]], meaning \"the Land of Seven Rivers\"<ref name=PE1781>{{PE|17}}, p. 81</ref> (alternatively \"Land of Seven Streams\"<ref>{{SM|Q10}}, p. 116</ref>).\n\n*Etymology: ''[[otso]]'' + ''[[sîr]]'' + ''[[-ian(d)]]''<ref name=PE1781/>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nEarly names used by [[J.R.R.
