It begins as six streams flowing into the Iron Hills from the nearby mountains, all shallow and rust-brown in colour. Across the Iron Hills, the streams eventually join into a single river, which then plummets down through several waterfalls into the area called \"the Barding-lands\", clearing it of sediment before it flows further to the south.\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Rivers]]\n[[Category:Rhovanion]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n\n[[de:Carnen]]\n[[fr:encyclo:geographie:eaux:rhovanion:carnen]]\n[[fi:Carnen]]"}}}
