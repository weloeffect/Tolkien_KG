Their flowers can be of many colours, but [[Goldberry]] the [[River-daughter]] seems to have had a particular interest in white lilies. [[Tom Bombadil]] travelled to the lower reaches of the [[Withywindle]] to gather white water-lilies for her, and it was while returning from a lily-gathering expedition that he discovered [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and his companions, and rescued them from [[Old Man Willow]].<ref>{{FR|I6}}</ref> Goldberry seems to have used her lilies to recreate her original home in the river: when Tom brought the [[Hobbits]] back to his house, they found a seated Goldberry surrounded by water-lilies floating in pots of earthenware.<ref>{{FR|I7}}</ref>\n\nLike many other types of plant and flower, water-lilies were also known to grow in the verdant lands of [[Ithilien]] by the River [[Anduin]]. Long after their adventure with Tom and Goldberry, Frodo and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] found their broad leaves floating in a quiet stream running down to the Great River.<ref>{{TT|IV4}}</ref>\n\nIn the poem ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil (poem)|The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'' it appears that Tom first met Goldberry when she pulled him by his beard under water-lilies in the Withywindle River.<ref>{{AB|Tom}}</ref>\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''1994: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]—[[Treasures of Middle-earth (2nd edition)|Treasures of Middle-earth]]''''' \n:'''''Sha''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''Ningalen'', [[Quenya|Q.]] ''Nellaica'') was a water lily from the bogs of the [[Ettendales]], whose powdered flowers enhanced the ability to see at the dark, though at the cost of it also being a strong laxative.<ref>{{ICE|2010}}, p. 182</ref><ref>{{ICE|2026}}, p. 134</ref>\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:'''''Marsh lilies''''' are a commonly featured plant, with the ones of [[Lossarnach]] being available as housing decoration.<ref>{{LOTROW|Item:Marsh Lily|8 September 2025}}</ref><ref>{{LOTROW|Item:Lossarnach Lily|8 September 2025}}</ref><ref>{{LOTROW|Item:Lossarnach Great-lily|8 September 2025}}</ref>\n\n'''2012: ''[[The One Ring (role-playing game)|The One Ring]]—[[Loremaster's Screen and Lake-town Sourcebook|Lake-town Sourcebook]]''''' \n:They are described as oval-leaved floating marsh plants, with white or yellow flowers.
