Sadoc was invented for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'' by [[Amazon Studios]], where he was portrayed by [[Lenny Henry]].<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9788618/fullcredits|articlename=Full Cast & Crew|dated=|website=IMDB|accessed=31 July 2022}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nNot much is known about Sadoc's past. At one point in time during the late [[Second Age]], he lost his wife, [[Daffodil Burrows]], to [[Wolves]] during a previous migration. Sadoc is in possession of a unique Star-book, which was handed down to him by previous Trailfinders. He uses it to aid his caravan in migrating from one seasonal haven to another.\n\nPrior to the beginning of autumn, Sadoc organized the [[Harvest Festival]] to prepare for the migration from the [[Norfield Glen]] to the [[Grove]].\n\nAround the time that [[The Stranger]] arrived, Sadoc began to notice a strange and peculiar [[Hermit's Hat|constellation]] in the sky.\n\nAfter [[Elanor Brandyfoot|Elanor Brandyfoot's]] rule-breaking was made known, Sadoc reluctantly forces the [[Brandyfoot family|Brandyfoot]] cart to follow at the back of the caravan, dooming them to the possibility of being left behind.\n\nDuring the migration, the Stranger proves himself trustworthy to Sadoc when he prevented three wolves from making a meal out of [[Malva Meadowgrass]], Elanor, and [[Poppy Proudfellow]]. However, despite attempting to heal the [[Grove]] from the debris of [[Mount Doom|Orodruin's]] eruption, the act very nearly harms Elanor and [[Dilly Brandyfoot]].\n\nLater, after the caravan's carts are burned to the ground by the [[Mystics]], who were attempting to pursue the Stranger, Sadoc organizes a company made up of Elanor, Poppy, and [[Marigold Brandyfoot]] to take revenge and warn the Stranger. However, despite defeating the Mystics at the [[East Bight]], the Nomad mortally wounded Sadoc. Though he did have enough time to slightly avenge himself before The Stranger banished the mystics. As the sun rose that morning, Sadoc died feeling it on his skin, believing in his heart that he would soon see his wife again.\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Hobbits from adaptations]]\n\n[[fi:Sadoc Burrows (televisiosarjan hahmo)]]"}}}
