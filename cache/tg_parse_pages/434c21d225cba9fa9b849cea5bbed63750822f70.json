Or maybe, as some say, alone in the waters, hungry and athirst, he fell into a trance and was granted a vision of that isle as it once had been, ere a [[West-wind]] arose and drove him back to [[Middle-earth]]. Of no other man is it reported that he ever beheld Eressëa the fair. Ælfwine was never again able to rest for long on land, and sailed the western seas until his death. Some say that his ship was wrecked upon the west shores of Erin and there his body lies; others say that at the end of his life he went forth alone into the deeps again and never returned.''<ref name=lostroad/>\n:''It is reported that before he set out on his last voyage he spoke these verses:<ref name=lostroad/>\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\n::þus cwæð Ælfwine Wídlást Éadwines sunu:\n:::Fela bið on Westwegum werum uncúðra,\n:::wundra and wihta, wlitescéne land,\n:::eardgeard ælfa and ésa bliss.\n:::Lýt ænig wát hwylc his langoð síe\n:::þám þe eftsíðes eldo getwæfeð.<ref name=notionclub>{{SD|66}}, p. 244</ref>\n</poem>\n''There is many a thing in the west of the world unknown to men; marvels and strange beings, [a land lovely to look on,] the dwelling place of the Elves and the bliss of the [[Gods]].
