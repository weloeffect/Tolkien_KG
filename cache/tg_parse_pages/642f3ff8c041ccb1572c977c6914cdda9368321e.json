Their position mirrors symmetrically the [[Yellow Mountains]] in the east.  This range was created when the [[Valar]] thrust [[Middle-earth]] eastward to give more protection to [[Valinor]].<ref>{{SM|5b}} p. 239</ref>\n\nSince no maps of the entire world exist after the [[First Age]], it is unknown if this mountain line still existed later. In any case they do not appear in the stories.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Mountain ranges]]\n[[de:Graues Gebirge (Hinnenlande)]]\n[[fi:Harmaavuoret (Esiajat)]]"}}}
