Sam informs Frodo that he promised [[Gandalf]] not to leave him, no matter what happens. They are interrupted when [[Merry]] and [[Pippin]] crash out of the corn, carrying stolen vegetables. More yelling is heard when [[Farmer Maggot]] approaches, chasing Merry and Pippin for stealing his crop. The four hobbits run from the enraged farmer and fall down an embankment onto the road. However, Frodo senses something approaching and implores the other hobbits to hide. Finding a tree root to hide under, they are startled by the approach of a [[Black Rider]] on horseback. The rider dismounts and begins sniffing for something. Frodo is almost overcome with the temptation to put on the [[The One Ring|Ring]] before Merry throws one of his stolen vegetables to distract the rider. The hobbits run away. Frodo looks down at the Ring, thinking the Riders are looking for it.\n\n==Differences==\n*Sam's promise is made to [[Gildor]] and the other elves,<ref>{{FR|Mushrooms}}, p. 87</ref> not Gandalf.\n*In the books, Farmer Maggot is a friendly character who helps Frodo reach [[Crickhollow]].<ref>{{FR|Mushrooms}}, pp. 95-7</ref> Pippin does not steal his crops and is on good terms with him.
