Its exact meaning is ambiguous: it appears in a passage that discusses Tuor's relationship with his descendants, the [[Númenóreans]], and so we have treated it here as an epithet for that division of Mankind.\n\nIt might conceivably, though, refer to the [[Valar]], though it seems unlikely that such a comparison would be made of a mortal Man.\n\n[[Category:Epithets]]"}}}
