He was present in the [[Council of Elrond]] representing Círdan. He asked about proofs that the ring of [[Frodo Baggins|the halfling]] was indeed the [[Great Ring]], and also inquired why [[Saruman]] was not with them. It was [[Gandalf]] who answered his questions, narrating his story on how he discovered the One Ring, and Saruman's treachery.\n\nIn a later point Galdor mentioned that he knew about the figure of [[Iarwain]], and he agreed with [[Glorfindel]] that he had not the power to defy [[Sauron]] and keep the Ring from him.\n\nThen, he agreed with Gandalf that not even the [[Sea]] could hide the Ring for ever. Galdor expected that the [[Ringwraiths]] (who were recently defeated in [[Bruinen]]) would soon return and [[Gondor]] could not stop Sauron from coming all the way to [[Lindon]] and reach the Sea. These were the last comments before Elrond decided that the only option is to destroy the Ring in [[Mount Doom]].<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn late writings, Tolkien speculated that this Galdor and the [[Galdor of the Tree|Galdor]] of ''[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]'' may have been the same,<ref>{{PM|Last}}, Glorfindel, pp. 387-388, note 1</ref> but he ultimately rejected the notion: if Galdor had remained behind, he would either have completely rejected the call of the [[Valar]], and thus have Fallen, or he would have had to leave and then return like [[Glorfindel]] did, which would make him a far more powerful person than his appearance in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' suggests.<ref>{{PM|Last}}, Glorfindel, p. 388, note 3</ref> For this reason Tolkien speculated that \"Galdor\" was simply a common [[Sindarin]] name.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Galdor in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game - Galdor, Councilor From the West.jpg|Galdor in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Galdor of the Havens.jpg|Galdor in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n\n'''2001-2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'':'''\n: A Decipher card identifies one of the Elves at the Council of Elrond in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' as Galdor.
