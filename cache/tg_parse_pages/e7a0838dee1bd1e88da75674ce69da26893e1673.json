When the [[Dwarves]] see a windlance outside their window, they recall the [[Sack of Erebor]], and Bain relates the story of how [[Girion]] managed to knock one of [[Smaug]]'s scales loose in the attack, though the Dwarves don't believe him. Just before being arrested, Bard instructs Bain to hide the last [[black arrow]] he has in his possession. When [[Bolg]]'s [[Orcs|Orc]] pack attacks [[Lake-town]], Bain assists [[Legolas]], [[Tauriel]], [[Fíli]], [[Kíli]], [[Óin]], and [[Bofur]] in fighting off the Orcs, and protects his sisters the best he can.\n\n'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''\n:Bain, Sigrid, and Tilda follow Tauriel and the Dwarves to evacuate Lake-town via boat while Smaug is destroying it. When he sees Bard making a last stand against the [[Dragons|Dragon]], Bain goes off to find the boat in which he hid the black arrow, and manages to deliver it to his father atop the bell tower. Bard constructs a large makeshift bow from the tower to fire the arrow at Smaug, using his son's shoulder to balance and aim the arrow. Bard urges him to stay calm as he fires the shot that ultimately kills the [[Fire-drakes|fire-drake]]. Later, as the [[Battle of Five Armies]] is getting underway, he and his sisters go into hiding in the ruins of [[Dale]] until the battle is over.\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n| race=northmen\n| died={{TA|3007}}\n}}\n{{seq\n| prev=[[Bard|Bard I]]\n| list=2nd [[King of Dale]]\n| dates={{TA|2977}} – {{TA|3007|n}}\n| next=[[Brand]]\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n{{hobbitfilms}}\n[[Category:Bardings]]\n[[Category:Kings of Dale]]\n[[Category:Norse names]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n\n[[de:Bain]]\n[[fi:Bain]]\n[[fr:encyclo:personnages:hommes:3a:hommes du nord:daliens:bain]]"}}}
