Nor would their tongue be heard again, unless the prophecy of [[Andreth]] the [[Wise-woman]] should prove true, that [[Túrin]] in the [[Last Battle]] should return from the Dead, and before he left the [[Circles of the World]] for ever should challege the Great Dragon of Morgoth, Ancalagon the Black, and deal him the death-stroke.<ref name=Andreth>{{PM|Ros}}, pp. 374-375, note 17</ref>}} \n\n[[Christopher Tolkien]] explains that this prophecy is in line with the different versions of the [[Dagor Dagorath|End of the World]] prophecies, as his father always used the term \"Last Battle\" to the apocalyptic event. However, he also notes that in the specific essay from which this quote is excerpted, the term \"Last Battle\" is clearly used to describe the battle at the end of the Elder Days, despite that in all previous texts it was Eärendil who destroys Ancalagon in the [[War of Wrath]].<ref name=Andreth>{{PM|Ros}}, pp. 374-375, note 17</ref>\n\n== Inspiration ==\nChristopher explains that Túrin slaying Ancalagon in Andreth's prophecy resembles [[:Wikipedia:Sigurd|Sigurd]] killing [[:Wikipedia:Miðgarðsormr|Miðgarðsormr]] in the ''[[Völuspá]]'', especially in the retelling his father made in the ''[[New Lay of the Völsungs]]''.<ref>{{SG|CV}}, \"Upphaf\", pp.?</ref>\n\n== In popular culture ==\nTwo animals are named after Ancalagon: ''Ancalagon'', a [[wikipedia:Cambrian|Cambrian]] [[wikipedia:Priapulida|priapulid]] by [[wikipedia:Simon Conway Morris|Simon Conway Morris]] in [[1977]], and ''Ankalagon'' by [[wikipedia:Leigh Van Valen|Leigh Van Valen]] in [[1980]], a [[wikipedia:Paleocene|Paleocene]] [[wikipedia:Mesonychid|mesonychid]] mammal.<ref>Chris Isaak, \"[http://www.curioustaxonomy.net/etym/fiction.html Names from Fictional Characters]\", ''[http://www.curioustaxonomy.net/index.html Curiosities of Biological Nomenclature]''</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n{{dragons}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:Dragons]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Noldorin names]]\n[[Category:Servants of Melkor]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n[[de:Ancalagon]]\n[[fr:encyclo:personnages:animaux:dragons:ancalagon]]\n[[fi:Ancalagon]]"}}}
