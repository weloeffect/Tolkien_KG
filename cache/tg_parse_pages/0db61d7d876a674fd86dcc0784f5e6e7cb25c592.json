Who shall call them\nfrom grey twilight,the forgotten people?\nthe heir of him to whom the oath they swore.\nFrom the North shall he come,need shall drive him.\nHe shall pass the door to the path of the dead.\n\nOn your knees...\nThe grey company is arriving now...\n</poem>\n[[Category:Songs by Summoning]]"}}}
