Though Legolas argues that [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] may very well be dead by now, Aragorn counters that the fate of the Ring-bearer is no longer in their hands: the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Company of the Ring]] has served its purpose. They chase the Orcs.\n\nThe Orcs have some distance on them. Merry and Pippin are forced to run with them, and are whipped along the way. Pippin falls, and an Orc captain berates him for it. He then asks [[Grishnákh]] for a drink, and when Grishnakh does not respond quick enough, knocks him over. He gives drink to the hobbits, who are less than pleased with the taste. The captain explains they will not get bed, or breakfast, until they reach [[Isengard]].\n\nAragorn finds the [[Elven brooches|brooch]], dropped by Pippin. He deduces that the troop of Orcs is almost a day ahead, and at least one of the Hobbits is still alive. He asks his companions whether to stay the night, or continue the hunt. Legolas favours continuing, Gimli favours a rest. When he learns they will not be resting, Gimli cries \"I cannot run all the way to Isengard!\"\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n! Role !!
