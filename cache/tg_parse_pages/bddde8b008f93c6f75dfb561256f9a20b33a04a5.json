Since in the Shire, [[The Rules]] were based solely on common sense and the ancient tradition, it was not broken. It was the Shirriffs' job to protect the Shire from various beasts more than anything. There were a total of twelve in all of the Shire, three in each [[Farthings|Farthing]], and they were distinguished from \"civilians\" by a feather worn in their caps.<ref>{{FR|Ordering}}</ref>\n\nA larger body of the Watch was the \"Special Constabulary\" power, where [[Hobbits]] were deputized into patrolling the borders, which were called [[Bounders]].\n\nThe number of Shirriffs was increased when [[Saruman]] had infiltrated the Shire, and had taken control, with the help of [[ruffians]] like [[Bill Ferny]]. Saruman had increased the number to suppress any revolts, and arrest anybody who broke the rules. They were assigned in companies such as the [[First Eastfarthing Troop]], though that was not enough to prevent [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], and others from liberating the [[Shire-hobbits|Shire-folk]]. After the Shire was retaken, Deputy-Mayor Frodo reduced their numbers to their original size.<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Teodort92 - Hobbit Shirriffs.jpg|thumb|''Hobbit Shirriffs'' by [[:Category:Images by Teodort92|Teodort92]]]]\n\n==Etymology==\nShirriff is an archaic rendition of \"sheriff\". Both mean \"shire-reeve\" ([[Old English]] ''scīrgerefa''). The archaism was made to make the connection to [[the Shire]] more obvious.\n\nShirriff is supposed to be a translation of a [[Hobbitish]] word, derived from their former language related to [[Rohan language|Rohirric]], not necessarily a [[Westron]] word.<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 763</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n\n'''2003: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''\n:The voice of an unnamed First Eastfarthing Troop shirriff is provided by Viliam Polónyi. The shirriff appears in the final episode of the series, in the part of the storyline that adapts the Scouring of the Shire.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Shirriff-house]]\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Organisations in the Shire]]\n[[de:Landbüttel]]\n[[fi:Toad Guards]]"}}}
