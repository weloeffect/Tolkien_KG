Wandering fold, the summons heed\nCome haste! Come haste! Across the waste\nThe king of friend and kin has need.\n\nNow call we over mountains cold\nCome back unto the caverns old\nHere at the gates the king awaits\nHis hands are rich with gems and gold\n\nThe king is come unto his hall\nUnder the mountain dark and tall\nThe worm of dread is slain and dead\nAnd ever so our foes shall fall\n</poem>{{References}}\n[[Category:Songs by Summoning]]"}}}
