Tolkien]]'s [[Dragons (lecture)|lecture on Dragons]]}}</center>\n\n'''Dragons''' also known as the '''Great Worms''' were creatures mostly seen in northern [[Middle-earth]] in the late [[First Age]]. They were greedy, cunning, seductive, and malicious servants of [[Morgoth]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Scouring the Mountain.jpg|thumb|left|''Scouring the Mountain'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\n===Origin and early history===\nIn {{FA|155}},<ref>{{GA|115}}</ref> when Morgoth saw how strong the [[Noldor]] were in battle, he realized that [[Orcs]] alone were insufficient for defeating his enemies. His solution, breeding a new race of monsters: Dragons.<ref>{{GA|115}}</ref><ref group=note>How this was done is unclear.</ref>\n\nThe Father of Dragons was [[Glaurung]], a mighty wyrm with cunning intellect and a powerful hypnotic gaze. Glaurung was integral in the fate of the Children of [[Húrin]]. Among his many misdeeds were the destruction of the Elf-realm of [[Nargothrond]], and the spell which stripped [[Nienor]] of her memory, which eventually led her to reunite with and marry her long-lost brother [[Túrin]]. When Nienor learned of Glaurung's plot, she committed suicide by jumping into [[Cabed-en-Aras]]. Glaurung was finally slain by Túrin, who after discovering Glaurung's plot committed suicide by stabbing himself with his black sword, [[Gurthang]].\n\nAt the [[Fall of Gondolin]], Morgoth's army included dragons, \"''many and terrible''\".<ref>{{S|23}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[War of Wrath]], Morgoth unleashed a new terror upon Middle-earth – the winged Dragons. Chief among these was [[Ancalagon | Ancalagon the Black]]. Eventually slain by [[Eärendil | Eärendil the Mariner]], Ancalagon's fall crushed the towers of [[Thangorodrim]]. Many of the dragons were slain but some fled and survived into the later [[Ages]].<ref>{{S|24}}</ref>\n\n===After the First Age===\nIt would appear that they fled to the [[Northern Waste]], far from the lands of [[Men]] and [[Elves]]. Though their number was lessened, over the centuries the race of Dragons continued to breed and repopulate, particularly in the [[Withered Heath]], an area in between two spurs of the [[Grey Mountains]]. Together with the Orcs, Dragons persisted as a threat to the race of [[Men]] throughout the [[Second Age|Second]] and [[Third Age]]s.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref><ref group=note>At the height of his power, Morgoth's successor, Sauron was said to have governed all foul things, possibly even a scarce few of the Dragons.</ref>\n\nIn the late [[Third Age]] the Dragons of the Withered Heath, stirred by the resurgence of all evil with [[Sauron|the One Enemy]]'s return, began to harass the [[Northmen]] and [[War of the Dwarves and Dragons|make war]] with the [[Dwarves]] around the year {{TA|2570}} ([[Dáin I]] and [[Frór]] of [[Durin's Folk]] were killed by a great [[Cold-drakes|Cold-drake]] in {{TA|2589|n}}).<ref>{{App|B2}}</ref><ref name=Durin>{{App|A3}}</ref> It was perhaps in these wars that Dragons swallowed four of the [[Seven Rings|Seven Dwarf-rings]].<ref name=Shadow>{{FR|Shadow}}</ref> \n\nThe most fearsome Dragon of the Third Age was [[Smaug]] the Terrible, who laid waste to the Dwarf-realm of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] and the nearby town of [[Dale]]. This devastated the area and sent [[Durin's Folk]] into exile. The [[Fire-drakes|Fire-drake]] remained in the abandoned halls of the Lonely Mountain for many years. Soon enough, the [[Istari|Wizard]] [[Gandalf]] became concerned that the Dark Lord Sauron could win the Dragon Smaug's allegiance and use him to devastate the North of Middle-earth. To prevent such a union, he encouraged and aided the expedition of [[Thorin and Company]] and their \"burglar\", the [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] [[Bilbo Baggins]]. This began a chain of events that led to Smaug's death at the hands of [[Bard]] the Bowman. \n\nAlthough Smaug was the greatest of the Dragons of his day,<ref name=Durin/> he seems not to have been the last of his kind as Gandalf told [[Frodo Baggins]] that \"''there is not now any dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough'' [to melt the Rings of Power]\",<ref name=Shadow/> indicating the presence of other, lesser dragons.<ref>{{L|144}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Dragons.jpg|thumb|Dragons by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]\nThe dragons were huge and longeval, with their lives spanning centuries. They shared a greed of treasure (especially gold), subtle intelligence, immense cunning, great physical strength, and their eyes and words had a hypnotic power called \"dragon-spell\". Those clever enough to avoid the spell never give direct information, but talked vaguely in riddles, since plainly refusing an answer would invite an immediate attack.\n\nApparently, dragons came from eggs.<ref>{{UT|9b}}: [[Glóin]]: \"dragonet new from the shell\"</ref>\n\nIt may be that dragons could sport horns.<ref>{{FR|Earendil}} where [[Eärendil]] wielded a [[bows|bow]] \"made of dragon-horn\"</ref>\n\nWhile dragons were armoured with iron scales, they had a soft spot underneath, in the region of the chest, which could be pierced by blades or darts.<ref>{{TT|Choices}}: \"But Shelob was not as dragons are, no softer spot had she save only her eyes.\"</ref><ref>{{H|12}}: \"dragons were softer underneath, especially in the region of the - er - chest\".</ref>\n===Means of locomotion===\nSome dragons ([[Glaurung]]) crawled like snakes, yet had four legs, like a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrapodophis Tetrapodophis].<ref>{{CH|14}}</ref><ref>{{S|20}}'</ref> These must have been the most common type of dragons in the late First Age, since the winged fire-dragons only first appeared during the [[War of Wrath]], while the winged [[Cold-drakes]] are only reported in ''[[Turambar and the Foalókë]]''. These (such as [[Ancalagon]] and [[Smaug]]) could both walk on four legs and fly using wings. Breeds of wingless dragons did survive into later Ages.\n\n===Fire breathing===\nThe ''[[Urulóki]]'' (singular ''Urulok&euml;'', Fire-drakes) could breathe fire. It is not entirely clear whether the term \"Urulóki\" referred only to the first dragons such as Glaurung that could breathe fire but were wingless, or to any dragon that could breathe fire, and thus include Smaug.  \n\nDragon-fire (of the Urulóki) was hot enough to melt [[Rings of Power]]: four of the [[Seven Rings]] of the Dwarves were consumed by Dragon-fire, although it was not powerful enough to destroy the One Ring itself.<ref name=Shadow/>\n\nThe dragons who could not breathe fire were known as [[Cold-drakes]]. Those were found mainly in [[Ered Mithrin]].\n\n== Individual dragons ==\n[[Image:John Howe - Smaug.jpg|thumb|''Smaug'' by [[John Howe]]]]\n* [[Glaurung]] &mdash; Father of Dragons, slain by [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]]. First of the Uruloki, the Fire-drakes of Angband.  He had four legs and could breathe fire, but didn't have wings.\n* [[Ancalagon]] the Black &mdash; first and mightiest of the Winged-dragons, slain by [[Eärendil]] in the [[War of Wrath]].\n* [[Scatha]] &mdash; Slain by Fram of the [[Éothéod]]. Apparently a cold-drake.  Described as a \"long-worm\", although this imprecise term seems to be more of an expression rather than a separate taxonomic group.  \n* [[Smaug]] &mdash; the last great dragon of [[Middle-earth]], slain by [[Bard]] of [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]]. A winged Urulokë.\n* [[Gostir]] &mdash; was one of the Dragons of Morgoth only known by name.\n* An unnamed dragon appears in [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] verse, said to have had red eyes, black wings and teeth like knives.<ref>{{AB|Hoard}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Dragon'' is derived from French; ''drake'' is an English word, from [[Old English]] ''draca'' (derived from Latin).<ref>{{HM|LT2}}, \"Short Glossary of Obsolete, Archaic, and Rare Words\", p. 350</ref>\n\nWords denoting \"dragon\" in [[Quenya]] are ''[[lókë]]'' and ''[[angulóke]]''. [[Sindarin]] has ''[[lhûg]]'' and ''[[amlug]]''.\n\nIn [[Gnomish]], \"dragon\" is ''fuithlug'' (\"a dragon who guards treasure\"), ''lingwir'' or ''ulug'' (plural ''ulûgin''; \"she dragon\" is ''uluch'', ''uluchnir'' or ''ulugwin'').<ref>{{PE|11}}, pp. 36, 54, 74</ref>\n\n==Other names==\nThe dragons were known by many different names:\n\n'''Worms''' referred to the race of dragons. It was used to refer to [[Glaurung]]<ref>{{CH|16}}</ref> as well as [[Smaug]].<ref>{{H|1}}</ref> In [[Gnomish]], one of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s early conceptions of an [[Elvish|Elven]] language, \"worm\" is ''gwem''.<ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 45</ref> ''Worm'' is also an actual old word for dragon,<ref>{{HM|OFS}}, p. 108</ref> derived from [[Old English]] ''[[wikipedia:European dragon|wyrm]]'', [[Old Norse]] ''ormr'' (\"[[serpents|serpent]]\").\n\n'''Long-worms''' referred to at least some dragons, although the only named example is related to [[Scatha]]:\n{{blockquote|[[Frumgar]], they say, was the name of the chieftain who led his people to [[Éothéod]]. Of his son, [[Fram]], they tell that he slew [[Scatha]], the great dragon of [[Grey Mountains|Ered Mithrin]], and the land had peace from the long-worms afterwards.|{{App|Eorl}}}}\n\n'''[[Serpents]]''' was used for dragons (properly great serpents),<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 370, entry \"[[LOK|LOK-]]\"</ref> as well as ordinary snakes.\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn the early [[The Book of Lost Tales|Lost Tale]] of \"[[Turambar and the Foalókë]]\", a legend among [[Men]] exists concerning dragons. Whoever tastes the heart of a dragon and can withstand its poisonous blood \"would know all tongues of Gods or Men, of birds or beasts, and his ears would catch whispers of the Valar or of Melko\".<ref>{{LT2|II}}, p. 85</ref>\n\nIn the \"[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|Fall of Gondolin]]\" it is told that Melko forged mechanical [[Iron Dragons]] to carry the armies of [[Orcs]] into the city.<ref name=Gondolin>{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|169}} However, along the battle there are many mentions of fire-drakes and beasts of unclear nature that resemble actual dragons, like the creature of fire with [[Balrogs]] in its back.<ref name=Gondolin>{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|181}}\n\n==Other fiction==\nA dragon named [[Chrysophylax]] appears in [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s story ''[[Farmer Giles of Ham]]''.\n\nIn the story ''[[Roverandom]]'', white dragons are among the creatures living on the moon. A dragon, called the Great White Dragon, attacks Rover and the moon-dog, and is said to be the origin of all white dragons. In Merlin's time, this dragon had been to the earth, and fought with the Red Dragon in Caerdragon. The Great White Dragon has wings and can breathe fire.<ref>{{HM|R}}, \"[Chapter] 2\"</ref>\n\nDragons also feature in ''[[Letters from Father Christmas]]''. In 1927 several were revealed to be living on the [[moon]].
