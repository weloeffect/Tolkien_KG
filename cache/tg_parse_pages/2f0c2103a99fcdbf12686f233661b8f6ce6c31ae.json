Tolkien]]. Tolkien corrected a few errors on the original map and supplied some additional place names and notes on nomenclature.<ref name=RC>{{HM|RC}}, pp. lxiv-lxvi</ref><ref name=TB>{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.tolkienbooks.net/php/details.php?reference=55350|articlename=A Map of Middle-earth|website=[http://www.tolkienbooks.net/ Tolkienbooks.net]}}</ref><ref>{{webcite|website=TS|articleurl=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/2015/11/tolkiens-annotated-map-of-middle-earth-transcribed|articlename=Tolkien’s annotated map of Middle-earth transcribed|dated=10 November 2015|accessed=11 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n\"New\" locations include: [[Dorwinion]], [[Eryn Vorn]], [[Andrast]], [[Drúwaith Iaur]], [[Undeeps]], [[Tumladen (Gondor)|Tumladen]]; the towns [[Framsburg]], [[Edhellond]], [[Lond Daer]]; and the rivers [[Adorn]], [[Glanduin]] and [[Swanfleet]] (labelled as a river). Other additions include wooded areas in Eryn Vorn, [[Enedhwaith]] and around the river [[Isen]], not indicated as such in earlier maps. The \"[[Éothéod]]\" are also labelled, indicating their original homeland (near [[Gundabad]]).\n\nThe name of the [[Grey Havens]] is labelled, but unlike in the earlier maps, their location is not indicated with an icon. [[Sarn Ford]] is labelled simply as \"Ford\". The [[Sea of Rhûn]] is now all occupied by water, whereas the earlier (as well as the [[The West of Middle-earth at the End of the Third Age|later]]) map by [[Christopher Tolkien]] indicated that it contained an island.\n\n==Publication history==\n[[Ballantine Books]] reproduced the map on the box of a set of a three-volume edition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (first printing 1970).<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://tolkien.skwishmi.com/guide/pbset.html|articlename=Ballantine and Del Rey Paperbacks|dated=|website=[http://tolkien.skwishmi.com/index.html The U.S. Tolkien Guide]|accessed=5 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nAt least 12 impressions of the trade edition poster-map (ISBN 0049120026) were issued:\n\n*1st impression 1970\n*6th impression 1974\n*7th impression 1974\n*8th impression 1975\n*12th impression 1986 (Unwin Books; printed by Henry Stone & Son (Printers), Banbury)<ref>Printer information from the collection of [[User:Morgan/Collection|Morgan Thomsen]].</ref>\n\nThe first print of the map had several mistakes, some being misreadings or misunderstandings of Tolkien's notes, and were brought to the attention of Christopher Tolkien. One mistake was \"Eryn Vor'''u'''\" instead of Eryn Vorn, and the label of \"R. [[Swanfleet]]\"/R. [[Glanduin]], applied to [[Isen]] in the south. Later printings of the map corrected such mistakes, including those of the original book map by C. Tolkien.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, pp. lxv-lxvi</ref>\n\nAfter the 7th impression, but not later than the 12th impression, a green border 17&nbsp;mm high was inserted between the top and bottom edges of the map and the illustrated borders.<ref name=TB/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[There and Back Again (map)]]\n{{references}}\n{{maps}}\n\n[[Category:Maps of Middle-earth]]\n[[fi:A Map of Middle-earth]]"}}}
