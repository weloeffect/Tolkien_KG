He appears on the marketplace of [[Bree]], where he sells several goods. He was asked by a [[Bree-men|man of Bree]], [[Otto Aster]], to sell weapons to him, so he could arm the towns of [[Bree-land]]. Grof originally refused, but after [[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]], [[Andriel]] and [[Farin (video game character)|Farin]] talked with him, on the request of Otto, he changed his view. Grof then returned to his home in the Blue Mountains to forge weapons for the [[Bree-landers]].<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], ''Forewarned is Forearmed''</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Images of Grof|Images of Grof]]\n*[[Otto Aster]]\n*[[Blue Mountains]]\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Dwarves from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: War in the North characters]]"}}}
