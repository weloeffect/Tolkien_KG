When the Witch-king stopped, Frodo feared they had been spotted; against his will, Frodo moves his hand towards the [[The One Ring|ring]]. Instead, he touched the phial - which he had forgotten - and the Witch-king continued on his way. The next morning, he made use of the phial again while leaving [[Minas Morgul]] behind.<ref name=Stairs>{{TT|Stairs}}</ref>{{rp|706–708}}\n\nFrodo used the phial to fend off the attacks of [[Shelob]], but he was eventually poisoned by her.<ref name=Lair>{{TT|Lair}}, p. 720-722, 725</ref> Sam could defeat the spider thanks to the Phial, and escaped her [[Shelob's Lair|lair]] after taking the star-glass with him, excusing himself to Frodo's body.<ref>{{TT|IV10}}, pp. 729-731</ref> Sam and Frodo later used it to overcome the will of the [[Two Watchers]] at the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]].<ref>{{RK|Tower}}, pp. 902, 915</ref> Sam also attempted to use the light in the [[Cracks of Doom|Crack of Doom]], but the light from the glass faded because they were in the heart of [[Sauron]]'s domain.<ref>{{RK|Doom}}, p. 945</ref>\n\nUpon Frodo's departure from [[Middle-earth]], the light from the phial faded as it reached the shores of [[Eldamar]].<ref>{{RK|Havens}}, p. 1030</ref>\n\n===Relation with Eärendil===\nGaladriel explained that her phial contained the [[light]] of the [[Star of Eärendil]] as reflected in her [[Mirror of Galadriel|Mirror]].<ref name=\"Farewell\"/> As Sam remembered to Frodo, the light of this star was the same [[Silmaril]] recovered by [[Beren]], now hold by [[Eärendil]].
