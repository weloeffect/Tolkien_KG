It held a special power of healing in the hands of the [[Kings of Gondor]].\n\n==History==\nDuring the [[First Age]] ''athelas'' was perhaps growing in [[Beleriand]]. [[Huan]] had found ''athelas'' to heal [[Beren]] of his wounds.<ref name=\"Canto10\">{{LB|C10}}</ref>\n\n''Athelas'' most notably grew on the island of [[Númenor]] and was brought to [[Middle-earth]] by the [[Númenóreans]].<ref name=\"Flight\">{{FR|I12}}</ref> It grew sparsely in [[Eriador|the North]] and only in places where the Men of Westernesse had camped or lived. By the end of the [[Third Age]] only the [[Rangers of the North]] retained the knowledge of its healing properties. \n\nIn [[Gondor]] (where it was known as '''kingsfoil''') the knowledge of its healing virtues had been lost by the [[Third Age]] (on account of their dependence on the long-absent kings),<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 581</ref> and its leaves were esteemed only for their refreshing scent and their potential ability to cure headaches. However, the memory of its former uses was retained in [[When the black breath blows|verses]] remembered by some of the older women in the Houses of Healing, and the special power it held in the hands of the [[Kings of Gondor]] was once again demonstrated by [[Aragorn]] upon his return to [[Gondor]].<ref name=\"Healing\">{{RK|V8}}</ref>\n\nAragorn was very familiar with the plant, and its long leaves<ref name=\"Flight\" /> were used by him on several occasions: healing [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] from the Morgul wound,<ref name=\"Flight\" /> tending the wounds of Frodo and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] after the exit from [[Moria]],<ref name=\"Lorien\">{{FR|II6}}</ref> and secretly entering [[Minas Tirith]] upon his return to [[Gondor]] to heal those touched by the [[Black Breath]], an act that enhanced his reputation and strengthened his claim to the crown.<ref name=\"Healing\" />\n\n==Properties and Effects==\n''Athelas'', when dried and crushed in hot water, was refreshing. It cleared and calmed<ref name=\"Flight\" /> the minds of those who smelled it. ''Athelas'' also strengthened<ref name=\"Lorien\" /> those smelling the scent. It had a particular scent that was either unique to the individual who smelled the herb or influenced by the recipient of the herb's effects:\n\n*[[Faramir]]'s scent was of \"dewy mornings of unshadowed sun... [in which] Spring is itself but a fleeting memory.\"<ref name=\"Healing\" />\n*[[Ioreth]] smelled the \"roses of Imloth Melui\" from her childhood.<ref name=\"Healing\" />\n*[[Éowyn]] smelled no scent, as if the air was clean, fresh, and had never \"been breathed by any living thing and came new-made from snowy mountains high beneath a dome of stars, or from shores of silver far away washed by seas of foam.\"<ref name=\"Healing\" />\n*[[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]]'s scent was that of \"orchards, and of heather in the sunshine full of bees.\"<ref name=\"Healing\" />\n\n==Etymology==\n''Athelas'' is a [[Sindarin]] word, consisting of ''[[athae]]'' + ''[[lass]]''.<ref name=\"Eldarin\">{{PE|Eldarin}}, pp. 49-100</ref> \n\nThe [[Quenya]] cognate is '''''asëa aranion''''' (\"asëa of the Kings\").<ref name=\"Eldarin\" /> It has been suggested that the whole name could mean \"Beneficial (leaf) of Kings\".<ref>[http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/quen-eng.htm Quettaparma Quenyallo] at [http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/ Ardalambion] (accessed 14 May 2011)</ref><ref>[http://www.tuckborough.net/plants.html Plants & Trees] (cf.
