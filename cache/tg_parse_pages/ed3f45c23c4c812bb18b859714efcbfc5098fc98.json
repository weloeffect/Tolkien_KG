In {{TA|2501}}<ref group=\"note\">Eorl was 16 when his father died. Since Eorl was born in {{TA|2485|n}} Léod died in 2501.</ref> he tried to tame it himself, but when he attempted to mount it, it threw him and escaped. So Léod died, leaving a sixteen-year-old son, [[Eorl]]. Eorl hunted the white horse, found it, called it \"Mansbane\" and demanded that it give up its freedom in payment for the death of his father. The horse agreed, and took the name that Eorl gave it: Felaróf.\n\nIt was on Felaróf that Eorl rode to the aid of [[Gondor]] and earned a famous victory,<ref>{{TT|King}}, p. 508</ref> one that would lead [[Ruling Steward|Steward]] [[Cirion]] to grant them the wide empty land of [[Calenardhon]], which would come to be called [[Rohan]]. For more than thirty years afterwards, Felaróf had the freedom of those wide grasslands, but a new invasion of [[Easterlings]] saw Eorl ride to battle once again. In [[The Wold]], the far northern reach of Rohan, Eorl and Felaróf met their ends, and were laid together in a mound raised outside the gate of [[Edoras]].\n\nFelaróf was a very remarkable horse indeed. It is even recorded that he could understand the speech of [[Men]]. He gave rise in turn to a race of wonderful horses, the [[Mearas]], who according to tradition could only be ridden by the [[Lord of the Mark]], Eorl's descendants. It was from this line that [[Gandalf]]'s horse [[Shadowfax]] came, making him a descendant of Felaróf himself.<ref name=eorl>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Felaróf'' is a poetic word in [[Old English]]: \"very valiant, very strong\".<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, note 28</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | | | NAH | | | | |NAH=Possibly [[Nahar]]<br/><small></small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |:| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |:| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | FEL | | | | |FEL='''FELARÓF'''<br/><small></small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |:| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |:| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | SHA | | | | |SHA=[[Shadowfax]]<br/><small></small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Felaróf.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Felaróf in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2020: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Felaróf appears briefly in the flashback narrating the history of the [[Éothéod]].\n\n{{references|n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Felarof}}\n[[Category:Horses]]\n[[Category:Old English names]]\n[[de:Felaróf]]\n[[fi:Felaróf]]"}}}
