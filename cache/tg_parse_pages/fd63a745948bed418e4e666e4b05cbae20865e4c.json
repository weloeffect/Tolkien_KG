Unusually for the game, it features neither vendor nor Quest-giver NPCs and aside from a brief visit by the player plays no role in the storyline.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Cities, towns and villages]]\n[[Category:Rohan]]\n[[de:Hochborn]]\n[[fi:Ylävuo]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/villes tours et forteresses/rohan/upbourn]]"}}}
