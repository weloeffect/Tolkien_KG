It was written by [[C.S. Lewis]] and originally published in ''Time and Tide'' on [[14 August]] [[1954]] (p.&nbsp;1082) reviewing ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''. \n\nIn the article Lewis likened the book with a \"lightning from a clear sky\", and compared it to [[Wikipedia:William Blake|Blake's]] ''[[Wikipedia:Songs of Innocence|Songs of Innocence]]''. For him it marked a triumphant and relieving return of the heroic romance in the anti-romantic age, while at the same time being a revolutionary work in that genre.<ref>Quoted in {{HM|RC}}, p. xxxvi</ref>\n{{references}}\n==External links==\n*[https://www.theonering.com/the-gods-return-to-earth-c-s-lewis-review-of-the-fellowship-of-the-ring The Gods Return to Earth] \n[[Category:Published articles]]"}}}
