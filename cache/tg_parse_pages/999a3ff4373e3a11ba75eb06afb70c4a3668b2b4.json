Tolkien - Doworst (manuscript).jpg|thumb|Tolkien's decorated manuscript.]]\nThe earliest surviving<ref name=collectedpoems/> manuscript, entitled both '''''Doworst''''' and '''''Visio Petri Aratoris de Doworst''''', was [[Letter to R.W. Chambers|given]] by Tolkien to [[R.W. Chambers]] as a [[Christmas]] gift<ref name=chambers>{{CG|2II}}, entry \"Chambers, Raymond Wilson\"</ref> on December 21<ref name=collectedpoems/> of [[1933]]. After the death of Chambers in [[1942]]<ref name=collectedpoems/>, the decorated manuscript containing the poem came into the possession of his secretary<ref name=collectedpoems/>, Winifred Husband. In [[1957]],<ref name=collectedpoems/> upon her retirement, Husband gave the manuscript to Arthur Brown, who later became the Professor of English at [[Wikipedia:Monash University|Monash University]] in Australia.<ref name=RG/>\n\nWhile the manuscript was later lost upon Brown's death in [[1979]],<ref name=collectedpoems/> parts of the poem and its background were printed as \"'''''Do Worst'''''\" in \"Fantasy that! — a Tolkien original\", an article published in July of [[1975]] within the third issue of the ''[[Monash Review 3 (1975)|Monash Review]]''. The article describes the poem's background and contains a transcription of a letter from Tolkien to R.W. Chambers.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.tolkienguide.com/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=1805&forum=9&post_id=9618#forumpost9618|articlename=Doworst in 'Monash Review'|dated=|website=Guide|accessed=27 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of [[1978]], the first nineteen lines of the poem were printed as \"'''''Doworst'''''\" in an article on the third page of [[A Elbereth Gilthoniel! 1, no. 2|''A Elbereth Gilthoniel!'' 1, no. 2]], an issue of ''A Elbereth Gilthoniel!'', a newsletter published by The Fellowship of Middle Earth, a Tolkien fan-group at Monash University.<ref name=RG/><ref name=DA>[[Douglas A.

Lewis]]. After Lewis's death in [[1963]], the manuscript came into Walter Hooper's possession and ended up in the Bodleian Library after Hooper's death.<ref name=collectedpoems/>\n\nIn the summer of [[1953]],<ref name=RG/> Tolkien revised the poem, shortening it significantly, and gave a calligraphic<ref name=lea>{{CG|2II}}, entry \"Lea, Kathleen Marguerite\"</ref> copy of it to Kathleen Lea,<ref name=RG/> who sent him a letter of thanks and some [[Wikipedia:Sherry|sherry]]<ref name=lea/> on [[5 August]].
