The square had many oak and poplar trees, and also a great well of vast depth with very pure water. During the [[Fall of Gondolin]], after the fall of the northern gate, many [[goblins]] reached the Place and the well became polluted with the carcases of Orcs. Later [[Galdor (elf of Gondolin)|Galdor]] and his [[House of the Tree|men of the Tree]] expelled the enemy there, saving [[Tuor]]. Then took place the scattering of many houses, forming a good battalion that Tuor led to the Square of the King.<ref>{{LT2|III}}, pp. 179, 182-183</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Gondolin]]\n[[Category:Locations in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Springs and wells]]"}}}
