He played an integral role in the Assault on Archet by the [[Blackwolds]]. After uncovering the betrayal of [[Calder Cob]], he was unable to convince his father that Calder was working for the [[Blackwolds]]. He later fought during the Assault on Archet, during which his father was killed by Calder. After the town's successful defence, he took his father's position as Captain and began rebuilding Archet.\n<ref>{{VGC|SAIB}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n\n\n\n[[Category:Men from adaptations]] \n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings Online characters]]"}}}
