There are still lingering vestiges of civilisation in Oxford of course, a civilization <nowiki>[sic]</nowiki> that for historical reasons did not reach the North before it was overwhelmed by the new barbarism - but it is still part of modern England (and a centre of the motor industry: that fantastic lunacy).}}\n\n[Second page:]\n\n{{blockquote|As for myself I find much that makes me regret Leeds very much. I doubt very much whether I should ever have torn myself away if I had been a single man, and able to disregard small differences in salary. The English School here is a battle-ground and there is small peace and little sense in it.<br/>I hope when you have dreed your unhappy weird in the Ed. Dept. — glorious product of half-baked pseudo-science — that you will get a job of a tolerable sort. Your qualifications are good enough anyhow. I hope you are [?well] and [?flourishing].
