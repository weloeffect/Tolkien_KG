This scene was not featured in the theatrical release of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''.\n{{title}}\n== Synopsis ==\n[[Aragorn]], [[Gandalf]], [[Legolas]], [[Gimli]], [[Merry]], and [[Pippin]] ride to the foot of the [[Black Gate]] and call upon ''the lord of the [[Mordor|Black Land]]'' to come forth. The Black Gate opens to issue a messenger: the [[Mouth of Sauron]]. Gandalf's message for [[Sauron]] is that he is to leave his lands and never return. The Mouth antagonises Gandalf and the rest of the company by presenting to them [[Frodo]]'s [[Mithril-coat]]. [[Pippin]] and [[Merry]] are clearly distressed, and the Mouth recognises that the vest-wearing halfling was dear to the company. He goes on to say that Frodo suffered greatly at the hand of Sauron. Tears appear in the eyes of Gandalf, and Legolas, Gimli, Merry, and Pippin appear anguished. Aragorn brings his horse close to the Mouth — who begins to goad Aragorn — and beheads him, saying he does not believe the story he has just heard regarding Frodo. \n\n== Differences ==\nThe confrontation between the [[Captains of the West]] and the [[Mouth of Sauron]] in this scene is closely aligned with that in the book chapter [[The Black Gate Opens]], with the exception of the beheading towards the end of the scene, and the absence of [[Imrahil]], [[Elladan]], and [[Elrohir]]. \n\nIn the books, as in this scene, Gandalf takes the lead in confronting the Mouth of Sauron. However, instead of solely showing the mithril coat, the Mouth shows the Captains the short sword that Sam had carried, and a grey cloak with an elven-brooch as well. \nInstead of killing the Mouth towards the end of the negotiations, Gandalf takes the three tokens from him and tells him to begone. He flees in fear of the Captains back to [[Cirith Gorgor]].<ref>{{RK|Gate}}, pp. 888-91</ref> \n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King scenes|64]]"}}}
