It was acquired by Random House in [[1973]], and remains part of that company today. Ballantine's logo is a pair of mirrored letter \"B\"'s back to back.\n\nDuring the early 1950s, Ballantine attracted attention as one of the leading publishers of paperback science fiction and fantasy. In the early 1960s the company engaged in a well-known rivalry with [[Ace Books]] for the rights to reprint the works of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and Edgar Rice Burroughs in paperback form. Ballantine prevailed in the struggle for the Tolkien corpus, and the two companies agreed to split the Burroughs list.\n\nIn [[October]] [[1965]] ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' was first published by Ballantine of New York, as an authorized paperback. It incorporated revisions that Tolkien had sent to [[Houghton Mifflin]].<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. xl</ref>\n==See also==\n*[[Barbara Remington]]\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.randomhousebooks.com/ Official website] (Random House Books)\n* [https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/ian-ballantine-helped-lead-paperback-revolution/ Ian Ballantine Made Paperbacks Required Reading]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yqr1wsiYhQw Video on Ballantine Books' contribution to the fantasy genre] by the Library Ladder\n{{references}}\n[[Category:American businesses]]\n[[Category:Publishers]]"}}}
