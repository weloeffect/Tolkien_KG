Christopher Tolkien preserved the \"style and detail\" of the original not because of its accuracy, but because of its acceptable faithfulness to his father's conceptions.<ref name=\"intro\" />\n\nSince [[2005]], it has been included in the [[HarperCollins]] editions of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name=\"RC\" />\n\n==Description==\n[[File:The West of Middle-earth at the End of the Third Age (colorized).jpeg|thumb|This colorized version can be found in ''[[The Fall of Númenor]]''.]]\nSmaller in scope than the original, this map excludes locations such as the [[Cape of Forochel]] in the north, or [[Umbar]] and [[Far Harad]] in the south. However the island of [[Himling]] is now included.<ref name=\"intro\" />\n\nThe [[Sea]] is now filled with contour lines radiating from the coasts, as has been the case with the inland bodies of water. \n\nThe [[Icebay of Forochel]] is now labelled with an arrow pointing to the larger northeast part of the bay, and not the small gulf. [[Christopher Tolkien]] stated that his original map was marked incorrectly.<ref name=\"intro\" />\n\nThe areas of [[Gondor]] and [[Rohan]] are more detailed with streets and roads, as seen in the ''[[Map of Rohan, Gondor, and Mordor]]'': [[Westfold]] and [[Eastfold]], separated by the [[Snowbourn]] are marked, as well as the [[Mering Stream]]. The [[Old South Road]] is renamed [[North-South Road]] and extends along the [[White Mountains]], although part of its course was conjectured by Christopher Tolkien.<ref name=\"intro\" />\n\nOther names not shown in the original map include:\n*[[Greylin]] and [[Langwell]]\n*[[Carnen]]\n*[[Arthedain]] and [[Cardolan]] are now included, alongside [[Rhudaur]]\n*[[Old Ford]]\n*[[East Bight]]\n*[[Annúminas]]\n*[[Crossings of Poros]]\n*[[Edhellond]] (conjectural)<ref name=\"intro\" />\n*[[Lond Daer]] (conjectural)<ref name=\"intro\" />\n*[[Harnen]]\n*[[Eryn Vorn]] now textured as a wooded area\n*[[Swanfleet]] and [[Glanduin]]\n*[[Adorn]]\n*[[Andrast]]\n*[[Drúwaith Iaur]]\n===Errors===\nOn the original print of the ''Unfinished Tales'' carried over a mistake from the ''general map'': the river [[Sirith]] was marked as the western tributary of [[Celos]], whereas the reverse is true.<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref><ref>{{TI|Map}}, p. 322 (note 9)</ref> The mistake was corrected in later (but not all) printings of the map.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. lxvii</ref>\n\n\n{{references}}\n{{maps}}\n\n[[Category:Maps of Middle-earth]]\n[[fi:Keski-Maan läntiset osat kolmannen ajan lopulla]]"}}}
