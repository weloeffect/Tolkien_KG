Various additional scenes pertaining to Arwen are inserted, some of which deviate from the books and some of which seem to be inspired by ''[[The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen]]''.\n\n:In the first film, she rescues [[Frodo Baggins]] from the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] at [[Bruinen]], thwarting them with a sudden flood, summoned by an incantation. In the book, it was [[Glorfindel]] who put Frodo on horseback and sent him alone to flee the Black Riders, and Elrond and [[Gandalf]] arranged the flood. Also, in the book, Frodo defends himself against the Black Riders, whereas in the movie Arwen defends him.  Arwen wields the sword [[Hadhafang]],a non-canonical sword that belonged to her father.\n\n:There is a scene in which Aragorn has a dream about Arwen in which they kiss, a scene where Arwen has an argument with her father about leaving for [[Valinor]], and a scene where she actually departs for Valinor and then changes her mind and returns when she sees a vision of her future son, Eldarion.\n\n:In addition, towards the end of the cinematic trilogy she apparently becomes sick, seemingly as a result of her forsaking her immortality. Elrond takes the reforged [[Narsil]], now [[Andúril]], to Aragorn at Dunharrow, and tells him that her fate has become bound with [[the One Ring]], and that she is dying. However, no explanation is ever given for these statements. It is possible that Elrond's comments of her dying is simply a metaphor of her becoming mortal, and that he is not implying she has a connection with the Ring, but that Arwen's decision to stay means that her future, like the other free peoples of Middle-earth, now rests on the destruction of the ring. Later, after the Ring is destroyed, Arwen is present at Aragorn's coronation without any signs of illness.\n\n'''2003: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''\n:The voice of Arwen is provided by Slávka Halčáková. She only appears in person in the third series (season) of the adaptation, during the events of ''The Return of the King'', but is alluded to earlier.\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Arwen can be found in a gazebo overlooking the path from [[Rivendell]] into the Misty Mountains. Her roles in the game was initially small, and her only significant interaction with the player was the passing of Elessar's banner that she made for [[Aragorn]] and bid the player to deliver to [[Halbarad]]. After the downfall of [[Sauron]], her prominence increases as [[Elrond]] and his household travel to [[Minas Tirith]] for her wedding. On their way towards [[Lothlórien]] from the lands of the [[Beornings]], Arwen asks her father to visit the cave in which her mother [[Celebrian]] was tormented by [[orcs]] before being rescued. She later discusses that experience with Lady [[Galadriel]].\n\n'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''\n:Arwen resides in Rivendell, where players can discuss with her both historical and present subjects. While sporting the appearance of [[Liv Tyler]], her role is closer to the book than that in the movie: for example, she provides Halbarad and the Grey Company with the banner she had made for Aragorn, an event omitted from the movie adaptation. She is voiced by [[Courtenay Taylor]].\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:Fourth Age characters]]\n[[Category:Half-elven]]\n[[Category:Gondorians]]\n[[Category:Noldor]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[de:Arwen]]\n[[fr:encyclo:personnages:elfes:semi-elfes:arwen]]\n[[fi:Arwen]]"}}}
