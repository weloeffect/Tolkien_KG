Gerda was invented for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'' by [[Amazon Studios]], where she was portrayed by an unknown actor.\n\n==History==\nGerda and her brother [[Gamli]] were born to Durin IV and Disa in the twenty years since [[Elrond]] last visited [[Khazad-dûm]]. Gerda and Gamli played with one another when Elrond visits Durin's chambers. They wore large stone heads that their father had previously told them not to wear and ran around the dining room.. Durin and Disa ushered them back to bed.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'', \"[[Adrift]]\"</ref> While [[Disa]] spoke to Elrond, Gamli and Gerda sung and punched each other. When Disa told them to stop, they claimed they were playing the 'Knocking Game'. Disa, again, told them to stop. Later, Gerda begun signing again and Disa exclaimed 'Gerda, I'm warning you!'<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'', \"[[The Great Wave]]\"</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Dwarves from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) characters]]"}}}
