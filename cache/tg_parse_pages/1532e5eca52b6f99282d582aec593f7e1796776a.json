The cave had been excavated by the stream feeding the waterfall, which originally fell from the hole in the cliff constituting the window in the name, but that stream had since been diverted and the tunnel sealed, save for a concealed entrance.<ref name=\"Window\">{{TT|IV5}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn the days of [[Ruling Steward|Steward]] [[Túrin II]] most of the remaining people of Ithilien departed due to the influx of [[Mordor-orcs]].

Faramir fed and spoke with the two travellers, gradually gaining their trust until Sam accidentally revealed Frodo's possession of [[the One Ring]]. However, Faramir resisted any temptation to seize it for himself. Later in the night, [[Gollum]] came to the Forbidden Pool beneath the cave. In order to save his life, Frodo had to draw in the creature until Faramir's men could capture him. Frodo convinced Faramir to spare Gollum even though Faramir had his doubts.\n\nOn the morning of [[8 March]], Frodo, Sam, and Gollum were allowed to depart from Henneth Annûn to continue their journey into [[Mordor]]. The [[9 March|next day]], Faramir and his men vacated the refuge;<ref name=\"Great\"/> three followed their captain to Minas Tirith while the remainder of the company rode to [[Osgiliath]].<ref>{{RK|V4}}</ref> The refuge remained abandoned during the rest of the War of the Ring.\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Henneth Annun.mp3|Ardamir}}\n''Henneth Annûn'' is also known as \"Window of the Sunset\" and \"Window on the West\", which are its translations in [[Sindarin]].\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Henneth Annûn in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers - Henneth Annûn.jpeg|''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Henneth Annûn.jpg|''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n'''2016: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The player doesn't visit Henneth Annûn until after the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].
