It was published in 2003.\n\n===From the publisher===\n{{blockquote|This comprehensive and discriminating account of Tolkien's work has been revised and expanded to take account both of recent developments in scholarship, and of the recent films directed by Peter Jackson. Tracing the development of Tolkien's creative technique over several decades, it explores the bewildering profusion of shorter works, as well as devoting an extended analysis to The Lord of the Rings. Chapters consider Tolkien's contribution to the history of ideas, and review the critical reception of the Lord of the Rings film adaptations and other popular adaptations of his work.}}\n\n===Contents===\n\n* Introduction\n* ''The Lord of the Rings'': Imagining Middle-earth\n* ''The Lord of the Rings'': Achieving the Narrative\n* Fiction and Poetry, 1914–1973\n* Tolkien in the History of Ideas\n* The Cultural Phenomenon\n\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Film books]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]"}}}
