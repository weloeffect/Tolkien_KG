Tuor noticed at [[Annon-in-Gelydh]] a light in his eyes unlike any he had seen in other Elves. Thus, Gelmir and [[Arminas]] must have been [[Calaquendi]] born in Valinor before the exile.\n\n==History==\nAfter the [[Dagor Bragollach]] (\"Battle of Sudden Flame\"), he wandered into the southern regions of [[Beleriand]], and settled with the people of [[Círdan]]. He was later sent by Círdan, with his companion [[Arminas]], as a messenger to [[Nargothrond]] to bring Orodreth Ulmo's warning of the fall of Nargothrond.<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref> Círdan's ships brought them to the [[Firth of Drengist]] from whence they turned east. On their way, they met [[Tuor]] who was searching for [[Annon-in-Gelydh]]. Amused, Gelmir and Arminas told him that he was standing right in front of it. Tuor told them about his intention to flee Dor-lómin and search for [[Gondolin]]. They gave him lamps for the tunnel and advised him to go to the havens of the south, for there he might find [[Gondolindrim]] whom Turgon had tasked to request the aid of [[Valinor]].\n\nThe Elves wished him luck and continued east. They crossed Dor-lómin but got sidetracked by the idea of finding Gondolin. From Gondolindrim among Círdan's people they guessed that Turgon still dwelt in the north. They searched the [[Vale of Sirion]] and all lands under the [[Ered Wethrin]] in vain and ultimately turned south to Nargothrond.\n\nThere, Gelmir told [[Orodreth]] and [[Túrin]] that they had come further than all other scouts of Nargothrond and seen an army gathering at [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth|Sauron's island]]. Gelmir also delivered Ulmo's message saying that the sources of Sirion were polluted and his power in that river diminished. Orodreth were to destroy the great bridge over Narog and not leave Nargothrond. Orodreth and especially Túrin mistrusted the message and the messengers. Threats and insults were exchanged, Túrin sent the messengers away and Nargothrond fell soon after as Ulmo had foreseen it. Gelmir and Arminas, however, returned south for Círdan had instructed them to give him Orodreth's reply as soon as possible.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name is [[Sindarin]], but of unclear meaning. It could be a combination of ''gell'' (\"joy\") and ''[[mîr]]'' (\"jewel\").<ref>{{HM|GS}}, p. 350</ref> If so, it is unusual that the m was not mutated to v, as would usually have happened. It may thus be that his name is in the [[North Sindarin]] dialect where this change did not occur.\n\n{{references}}\n{{title}}\n[[Category:Noldor]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Children of Húrin]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n\n[[de:Gelmir (Elb aus dem Volke Angrods)]]\n[[fi:Gelmir (Arminasin toveri)]]\n[[fr:/encyclo/personnages/elfes/noldor/gelmir]]"}}}
