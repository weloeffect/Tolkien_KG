Just before the Great Gate it appeared that they would reach Faramir when Gandalf rode in and dispelled them. The next day Denethor sent his son to man the [[Rammas Echor]]; when the forces of [[Sauron]] overwhelmed the defenders Faramir was again forced to lead his men back to the city. Again the Nazgûl dove upon the [[Gondorians]]. Not two furlongs from the Great Gate they attacked and this time managed to wound Faramir.<ref name=Siege/>{{rp|820–1}}\n\nIn the great [[Siege of Gondor|siege of Minas Tirith]], on [[15 March]] {{TA|3019|n}},<ref name=Great/> after midnight the host of Sauron attacked the City Wall in many places to test the strength of the defences and to keep the defenders occupied in many places. They concentrated their attack on the Great Gate by moving great siege towers and [[Grond (battering ram)|Grond]], a hundred-foot long battering ram towards the gate under the command of the [[Witch-king]]. Shortly before dawn, the battering ram reached the gate and pounded the Great Gate four times while the Witch-king spoke words of power during the last three strokes of the ram. At the last stroke there was a flash of lightning and the gate broke and the fragments of the door fell to the ground. The Witch-king rode through the Great Gate where Gandalf awaited him and forbade him to enter,<ref name=Siege/>{{rp|828–9}} but then he turned back when the [[Rohirrim]] arrived to command his troops against the onrushing Rohirrim.<ref>{{RK|Battle}}, p. 839</ref>\n\nAfter the rout of the host of Sauron from the Pelennor, a temporary barricade was erected in place of the Great Gate.<ref name=Steward/> Later, on [[1 May]] {{TA|3019|n}},<ref>{{App|Chief}}, entry for the year 3019, May 1, p. 1095</ref> [[Aragorn]] received the [[Crown of Gondor]] in front of the ruined Gate and then [[Húrin the Tall|Húrin]], the [[Warden of the Keys]], opened the barricade for him to enter the City.<ref name=Steward>{{RK|Steward}}, p. 966-8</ref>\n\nSometime after the [[War of the Ring]], [[Gimli]] became the Lord of [[Glittering Caves|Aglarond]].
