Formless, save for the armour that binds them, they stalk the paths about Dol Guldur, slaying those they find. Each fell to Sauron’s service in a different way; some sought to learn from him as an apprentice does from a master, and others are the eternal remnants of one who has died in agony in Sauron’s dungeons. However they came into the Dark Lord’s service, they are all now bound to his curse and serve him absolutely.\n\n[[Category:Concepts from adaptations]]"}}}
