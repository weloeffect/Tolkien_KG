[[Tarannon Falastur]] built a great house there, with its roots in the water which he so dearly loved.

[[Aragorn]]'s retaking of Pelargir was featured in an Epic Battle and served as the climax of Book 2 of Volume IV. The city's emblem was a blue anchor on a white background, with gold trim. The city was divided into the West-garth, the East-garth, the Market Ward, the Shipwrights' Ward, the Court of the Ship-Kings, and Tol Ciryarani, though the latter was rendered inaccessible by a collapsed bridge by the time Aragorn liberated the city. Argillond, the Harbor of Royal Ships, was partitioned from the rest of the Great River by two sea-gates, one on the east and one on the west.\n\n:Sirgon was Lord of the city during the [[War of the Ring]], and was captured and spirited away by [[Haradrim]] slavers when the city was captured. Sirgon's son Faltharan and his captain Thandor took command of the city following its liberation. Faltharan managed to rescue his mother and siblings, only to soon discover his brother Lorvegil had betrayed the city to the [[Corsairs of Umbar|Corsairs]], allowing it to fall. After apprehending Lorvegil, Faltharan discovered and rescued their father at the [[Warning beacons of Gondor|beacon]] Sirthanc in Upper Lebennin.\n\n'''2022: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'':'''\n:After surviving the [[Udûn (episode)|eruption]] of [[Orodruin]] and [[The Eye|escaping]] the newly-named [[Mordor]], [[Bronwyn]] informs [[Galadriel]] upon a hilltop that she was planning on leading the surviving [[Pre-Númenóreans|Southlander]] remnant to Pelargir, which she refers to as \"''an old [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] colony''\".\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{FellowshipRoute}}\n[[Category:Cities, towns and villages]]\n[[Category:Gondor]]\n[[Category:Harbours]]\n[[Category:Sieges]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[de:Pelargir]]\n[[fi:Pelargir]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/villes tours et forteresses/gondor/pelargir]]"}}}
