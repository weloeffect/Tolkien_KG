And he came like a storm of laughter and loud song, and Earth shook under his great golden feet. So came Tulkas, the Strong and the Merry, whose anger passeth like a mighty wind, scattering cloud and darkness before it. And Melkor was shaken by the laughter of Tulkas, and fled from the Earth; and there was peace for a long age.|''[[Morgoth's Ring]]'', \"The Music of the Ainur and the Coming of the Valar\"}}\n\n'''Tulkas''' was a [[Valar|Vala]]. He was the most warlike of the Valar and the spouse of [[Nessa]].\n\n==Attributes==\nTulkas was so strong and quick that he needed no weapon or steed. He delighted in deeds of prowess and strength such as wrestling and fighting. But he was not dreadful; he laughed loudly in sport and war and his anger dispelled [[darkness]] and clouds.<ref name=\"vala\">{{S|IIb}}</ref><ref name=\"s1\">{{S|1}}</ref> \n\nHe was a hardy friend and slow to wrath, but also slow to forgive.

This is an absence of all compromise which will even face apparent evils (such as war) rather than parley; and does not (in any kind of pride) think that any one less than Eru can redress this, or rewrite the tale of Arda.<ref>{{MR|P5VI}}</ref>{{rp|522}}\n\n==History==\nTulkas was [[Creation of the Ainur|created]] by [[Eru]] with the other [[Ainur]] and sang in the [[Song of the Ainur]], and chose to enter [[Eä]]. His spirit was wandering Ea and did not participate in the formation of [[Arda]] with the other [[Valar]]: He heard of their [[First War]] with [[Melkor]] [[Valian Year 1500|1500]] [[Valian Years]] after their arrival, and descended to them from the far heavens. The Dark Lord might have defeated the Valar by himself, but hearing the sound of Tulkas' laughter and beholding his wrath, Melkor fled before him.<ref name=\"s1\" /> \n\nThanks to him, the Valar now continued their work in peace, and the [[Spring of Arda]] was begun. After the [[Two Lamps]] were erected and the Valar had made their first dwelling at [[Almaren]], Tulkas wedded [[Nessa]] in a great feast. Being weary and content he slept, and Melkor decided his hour to retaliate had come, and ruined the Lamps, causing a cataclysm.<ref name=\"s1\" />\n[[File:Antonio Vinci - Tulkas.jpg|thumb|left|''Tulkas'' by [[:Category:Images by Antonio Vinci|Antonio Vinci]]]]\nAfter the cataclysm, the Valar and their people went to [[Valinor]]. Anticipating the [[Awakening of the Elves]] he urged the other Valar to wage war against Melkor.\n\nBut when [[Oromë]] announced that the [[Elves|first Children of Ilúvatar]] did awake, Manwë called a council at the [[Ring of Doom]] and announced the will of Eru that, for the sake of the Elves, the Valar should regain guardianship of the world from Melkor. Tulkas was glad of this decision. In the [[Battle of the Powers]], after a long siege at [[Utumno]], it was Tulkas who wrestled with Melkor and cast him upon his face. Tulkas [[Chaining of Melkor|chained]] Melkor with the enchanted chain [[Angainor]], forged by [[Aulë]]. For a while the world was free from Melkor's influence.<ref>{{S|3}}</ref>\n\nWhen his sentence was fulfilled, Melkor repented of his actions and was pardoned by [[Manwë]]; Tulkas was disappointed with this decision, ever distrustful. But having fought Melkor in the name of authority, he could not rebel himself, and accepted Manwë's decision.<ref>{{S|6}}</ref>\n\nAfter the lies spread by Melkor were known, Tulkas and Oromë seached him in the north of Aman, but he was already escaped south. And when Melkor and [[Ungoliant]] caused the [[Darkening of Valinor]], Tulkas and Oromë searched in vain for them, unable to penetrate the unlight cast by Ungoliant.<ref>{{S|8}}</ref> Shortly after, Tulkas hurried [[Fëanor]] to take a decision about surrendering the [[Silmarils]].<ref>{{S|9}}</ref>\n\nIt is said that in the [[Dagor Dagorath]], Tulkas will once more oppose [[Melkor]], and will directly fight him in the battle.
