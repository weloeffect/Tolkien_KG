followedby=\n}}\n'''Valinor''' or '''Valinórë''' was the realm of the [[Valar]] in central [[Aman]].\n\nValinor was the place to which the Valar moved after [[Almaren]] was destroyed by [[Morgoth|Melkor]]. Valinor properly refers to the inhabited lands of the continent of Aman, home to the Valar and the three kindreds of [[Elves]]: the [[Vanyar]], the [[Noldor]], and some of the [[Teleri]]. [[Valimar]] is its central city. The island of [[Tol Eressëa]] was located just off the eastern shore.\n\n==Description==\nValinor was encircled by the [[Pelóri]] mountains to the east, which were raised by the Valar as a defence against Melkor. To the west was [[Ekkaia]], the encircling sea which surrounded both Valinor and [[Middle-earth]].\n\nEverything in the realm, from the stones to the waters, were hallowed and stainless and there was no sickness, corruption or withering. In Valinor the Valar brought what beauty and light they salvaged from the [[Spring of Arda]] before the [[Arda Marred|marring]], and they created new things, making Valinor even fairer than Almaren.<ref name=\"s1\">{{s|1}}</ref> \n\nIts major city was [[Valimar]] of many bells, built in the midst of the plain,<ref name=\"s1\" /> where the [[Vanyar]] and the [[Valar]] reside. To the west of Valimar was a green mound called [[Ezellohar]] and from this mound grew the [[Two Trees]] that lit the land.<ref name=\"s1\" />\n\nTwo other cities are [[Alqualondë]] and [[Tirion]], the respective homes of the [[Falmari|Teleri]] and the [[Noldor]]. It also had an island, [[Tol Eressëa]], just off its east coast.\n\nEach of the Valar had their own region of the land where they resided and altered things to their desire:\n*[[Yavanna]], the Vala of nature, growth, and harvest, resided in the [[Pastures of Yavanna]] in the south of Aman.\n*[[Oromë]], the Vala of the hunt, lived in the [[Woods of Oromë]] to the north-east of the pastures. The forest was home to many creatures which Oromë could track and hunt.\n*[[Nienna]], the lonely Vala of sorrow and endurance, lived cut off in the far west of Aman in the [[Halls of Nienna]] where she spent her days crying, looking out to sea. Just south of the Halls of Nienna and to the north of the pastures there were the [[Halls of Mandos]].\n*[[Mandos]], the brother of Nienna, was the Vala of the afterlife. All inhabitants of [[Arda]] went to the Halls of Mandos should they happen to die, mortals and immortals alike although it was said that in death as in life, they were separated. Also living in the Halls of Mandos was his spouse [[Vairë]] the weaver, who wove the threads of time.\n*To the south were situated the [[Lórien (Valinor)|Gardens of Lórien]], where dwelt [[Irmo]], the Vala of dreams. And on an isle situated in the middle of the lake of [[Lórellin]] in Lórien, dwelt Irmo's wife [[Estë]].\n*To the north of this were the Mansions of [[Aulë]] the smith Vala who was spouse to Yavanna.\n*In the north-east lay the Mansions of [[Manwë]] and [[Varda]], the two most powerful Valar.\n\nTo the west of them stood the [[Ring of Doom]], and nearby the mound [[Ezellohar]] with the [[Two Trees of Valinor]], [[Telperion]] and [[Laurelin]].<ref name=\"s1\" /> \n\nAfter the destruction of [[Númenor]], the [[Undying Lands]] were removed from [[Arda]] so that [[Men]] could not reach them and only the Elves could go there by the [[Straight Road]] and in ships capable of passing out of the Spheres of the earth.\n\n==History==\nIn [[Days before days|Year of the Valar]] 3450<ref name=\"Annals\">{{MR|P2a}}</ref> the [[Spring of Arda]] ended when Melkor cast down the [[Two Lamps]] and destroyed the original dwelling of the Valar upon the isle of [[Almaren]].  The Valar departed from [[Middle-earth]] and settled in Aman. There they established the realm of Valinor.<ref name=\"s1\" />\n[[File:Šárka Škorpíková - The Two Trees of Valinor.jpg|thumb|''The Two Trees of Valinor'' by [[:Category:Images by Šárka Škorpíková|Šárka Škorpíková]]]]\nAfter the destruction of the Lamps came the [[Years of the Trees]] and in {{YT|1050}} the [[Elves]] awoke.<ref>{{GA|3}}</ref>  At first the Elves were unwilling to heed the summons of the Valar to come to Valinor. The Vala [[Oromë]] selected three ambassadors, [[Ingwë]], [[Finwë]], and [[Elwë]]<ref name=\"Coming\">{{S|Captivity}}</ref> in {{YT|1102|n}}<ref>{{GA|7}}</ref> who were swiftly brought to Aman and beheld the light of the Trees.  These three Elven-kings persuaded many of the elves to journey to Aman.  In {{YT|1132|n}}<ref>{{GA|11}}</ref> the [[Vanyar]] and [[Noldor]] departed from Middle-earth upon an island that was drawn across the Sea to Aman.  The third group of the Elves, the [[Teleri]] remained in Middle-earth until {{YT|1149|n}}<ref>{{GA|13}}</ref> when many of them were brought to Aman.\n \nThe [[Elves]] who arrived to Aman in the Years of the Trees were called [[Amanyar]] or [[Calaquendi]] because they saw the light of the Two Trees. The Valar opened a cleft between the Pelóri, the [[Calacirya]], so that the Light reached the Elves in their lands and cities, [[Eldamar]], [[Tirion]], [[Alqualondë]] and [[Tol Eressëa]].<ref name=\"Eldamar\">{{S|Eldamar}}</ref>\n \nAfter the Exile of Feanor, the [[Noldor]] were not allowed to return to Valinor,<ref name=\"Flight\">{{S|Flight}}</ref> and it was hidden from Mortal lands. The Valar heightened the Pelóri even more, fortified Calacirya and raised the Enchanted Isles in the [[Shadowy Seas]].<ref name=\"Sun\">{{S|Sun}}</ref>  There were many attempts to reach the Undying Lands from [[Beleriand]] by ship, of which only [[Voronwë]] Aranwion survived;<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref> it is told that maybe [[Tuor]] was, alone of the mortals, allowed to find Aman before his son [[Eärendil]].<ref>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>\n \nEärendil was the first known navigator to succeed in passing the Isles of Enchantment, guided by the light of the [[Silmaril]], who came to Valinor to seek the aid of the Valar against Melkor, now called ''Morgoth''. His quest was successful and the Valar went to war again.<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref>\n \nAfter the [[War of Wrath]] and the destruction of Beleriand, Aman was no more connected to Middle-earth by the Helcaraxë but could be reached by the ships of the Elves.\n \nSoon after this, the great island of [[Númenor]] was raised out of Belegaer, far from the shores of Aman, and the Three Houses of the [[Edain]] were brought to live there. Henceforth, they were called the [[Dúnedain]], and were blessed with many gifts by the Valar and the Elves of Tol Eressëa. The Valar feared—rightly—that the [[Númenóreans]] would seek to enter Aman to gain immortality (even though a mortal in Aman remains mortal), so they forbade them from sailing west from Númenor.\n \nIn time, and not without some corrupting help from [[Sauron]], the Númenóreans violated the [[Ban of the Valar]], and sailed to Aman with a great army under the command of [[Ar-Pharazôn]] the Golden. A part of the Pelóri collapsed upon this army, trapping it but not killing it. It is said that the army still lives underneath the pile of rock in the [[Caves of the Forgotten]].\n \nIn light of this development, the land of Aman was decisively and forever isolated from the other lands. The flat [[Arda]] was cloven in two, and the rest was made round, so that a mariner sailing west along Eärendil's route would simply emerge in the far east. For the Elves, however, a [[Straight Road]] remains that peels away from the curvature of the earth and passes to Aman.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> A very few non-Elves are known to have passed along this road, including [[Frodo Baggins]], [[Bilbo Baggins]], and possibly [[Samwise Gamgee]] and [[Gimli]].<ref>{{App|Later}}, {{SR|1482}} and {{SR|1541}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Valinor'' (archaic ''Valinórë'') is [[Quenya]] meaning \"Land of Valar\". There is also the name ''Valandor'' of roughly the same meaning, but the term is never used.<ref>{{WJ|Author}}, p. 413</ref>\n\n==Other names==\nThe [[Sindarin]] name ''Balannor'' is given once, but it seems to have been replaced by '''''Dor-Rodyn'''''.<ref>{{MR|P3II1}}, p. 200</ref>\n\nThe terms ''[[Evereven]]'' or ''Ever-eve'' also referred to Valinor in [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]'s [[Eärendil was a mariner|song]] of [[Eärendil]] in [[Rivendell]].<ref>{{FR|II1}}, p. 146</ref>\n\nIn [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] lore, the mythical West was known as ''[[Faerie]]''.{{Fact}}\n\nIn one of [[Edwin Lowdham]]'s [[Old English]] texts, the land is called ''Ósgeard'',<ref>{{SD|2eiv}}, pp. 316-317</ref> while the name that \"came\" to his son [[Alwin Arundel Lowdham|Arundel]] was ''Regeneard'', \"God-home\".<ref>{{SD|66}}, p. 242</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nIt has been suggested that the concept is mainly based on the legend of Faery of western mythology, as indicated by the hobbitish name.\n\nFurthermore, it seems to have been based on ghost and heavenly islands of ancient and medieval legends: Avalon, Hy Brasil, the Blessed Isles, the Elysian Fields, were mythical lands envisioned by the ancient peoples to be far into the western ocean. The legend somehow survived the Middle-Ages with [[Saint Brendan]]'s Island.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Rings of Power (TV series) - Valinor.jpg|thumb|Valinor in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power|The Rings of Power]]''.]]\n\n'''2022: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'':'''\n:'''September 1: ''[[A Shadow of the Past]]'':'''\n::Valinor is shown in the opening sequence.
