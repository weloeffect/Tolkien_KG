It is the [[Lone-lands]] settlement closest to [[Bree-land]] and lies in the shadow of [[Weathertop]]. A respite for travelers, the Inn has a milestone, mail service, and many merchants, in addition to a great number of people in need of travellers' assistance. These include the Inn's proprietor, Anlaf, and his staff as well as travellers, guests, and some of the Eglain, meaning the Forsaken, that have recently been displaced from Minas Eriol.\n\n:To the north and northeast lie the ruins of the fortifications of the war between [[Arthedain]] and [[Rhudaur]], now occupied and spanned by camps of [[orcs]] and goblins. Ruins also lie to the south-east, and along both sides of the road to the East. A long journey across the Lone-lands in that direction eventually leads to Ost Guruth, the last settlement before the [[Hoarwell]], which marks the borders of the [[Trollshaws]].<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://lorebook.lotro.com/wiki/Landmark:The_Forsaken_Inn|articlename=The Forsaken Inn|dated=|website=[http://lorebook.lotro.com/ LoreBook.Lotro.com]|accessed=20 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://middle-earth.xenite.org/2013/02/19/is-there-any-information-about-the-forsaken-inn/ Is There Any Information About the Forsaken Inn?] by [[Michael Martinez]]\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Forsaken Inn, The}}\n[[Category:Eriador]]\n[[Category:Inns]]\n[[de:Verlassene Herberge]]\n[[fi:Hyljätty majatalo]]"}}}
