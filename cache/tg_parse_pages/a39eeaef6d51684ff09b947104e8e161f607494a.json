Farewell!|Huor to [[Turgon]], ''[[Children of Húrin]]'', \"[[The Battle of Unnumbered Tears]]\"}}\n\n'''Huor''' was a [[Man]] of the [[House of Hador]]. He was the younger brother of [[Húrin]], the father of [[Tuor]], and thus the grandfather of [[Eärendil]]. \n\nAlongside Húrin, he fell in the [[Battle of Unnumbered Tears]], serving as a rearguard for [[Turgon|Turgon's]] escape.\n\n==History==\n===Early life===\nHuor was born in {{FA|444}},<ref>{{GA|143}}</ref> as the second son of [[Galdor (Lord of Dor-lómin)|Galdor]] and therefore of the House of Hador which ruled the realm of [[Dor-lómin]] as vassals under the [[House of Fingolfin]]. Huor was also closely akin to the [[House of Haleth]] through his mother [[Hareth]], and his uncle [[Haldir_(Chieftain_of_Brethil)|Haldir]] who was both the brother of Hareth and husband of Galdor's sister [[Glóredhel]]. \n\nHuor's elder brother was Húrin, and there was great love between them and they were seldom apart in their youth.<ref>{{CH|1}}</ref> At some point in their youth they were sent to [[Brethil]] to dwell as foster sons of Haldir, as was the custom among northern Men in those days.<ref name=\"coh\">{{CH|1}}</ref>\n\n===An end of peace and mirth===\nIn {{FA|455|n}}, Morgoth unleashed a terrible assault, in what became known as the [[Dagor Bragollach]]. In this battle, Galdor's father perished, and Galdor thus became the [[Lord of Dor-lómin]];<ref>{{GA|147}}</ref> shortly after, Fingolfin fell in a [[Fall of Fingolfin|duel with Morgoth himself]]. With the [[Siege of Angband]] broken, [[Orcs]] began harrying the northern borders of Brethil and Húrin and Huor, who would not be restrained, often went to battle with the Men of Brethil against them.<ref name=\"coh\" />\n\n[[File:Mysilvergreen - Hurin and Huor are landing in Gondolin.jpg|thumb|left|''Hurin and Huor are landing in Gondolin'' by [[:Category:Images by Mysilvergreen|Mysilvergreen]]]]\nBy {{FA|458|n}}<ref name=\"ga161\">{{GA|161}}</ref> Huor, though only thirteen, was already as tall as most full-grown men of that people.<ref name=\"coh\" /> In that year, a legion of Orcs came down the [[Sirion]] and the company of scouts Húrin and Huor were part of was ambushed and scattered. The brothers were pursued to the [[ford of Brithiach]] and there they would have been captured or slain but for a mist, thought to have been raised by [[Ulmo]], which hid them and allowed them to escape to [[Dimbar]]. There, they wondered in the hills beneath the [[Crissaegrim]], lost and in bewilderment at the deceits of that land. While wondering they were noticed by [[Thorondor]] who sent two [[Eagles]] to bear them beyond the mountains to the hidden city of [[Gondolin]], which no Man had before seen.<ref name=\"coh\" />\n\n[[Turgon]], the King of Gondolin and son of Fingolfin, welcomed the brothers. Their ancestor [[Hador]] was an [[Elf-friend]], and Turgon had been counselled by Ulmo to deal kindly with his house as from them great help would come to him in time of need. Húrin and Huor thus dwelt as guests in Gondolin for nearly a year and Turgon spoke often with the brothers, developing a great liking for them. He thus wished to keep them in Gondolin for both love as well as law, for it was the law of the king that no one who entered Gondolin would be permitted to leave until he himself opened the leaguer and brought them forth.<ref name=\"coh\" />\n\nBut Húrin and Huor, with their time of hope and strength as Men being much shorter than that of Elves, desired to return to their people and share in their wars and griefs. They further argued that they knew not the way to Gondolin, being brought by air and their eyes by mercy being veiled. Turgon grieved at this, but relented and gave them permission to leave as they came, if the Eagles were willing.<ref name=\"coh\" />\n\n[[Image:Catherine_Chmiel_-_Hurin,_Huor_and_Maeglin.jpg|right|thumb|''Hurin, Huor and Maeglin'', by [[Catherine Chmiel]]]]\nThe king's sister-son, [[Maeglin]], however, loved not the kindred of Men; and while he did not grieve their leaving, he begrudged that Turgon should show them such favour as permitting it. He spoke to the brothers that some might wonder why the law should be abated for \"two knave-children of Men\", and that it would be better if they had no choice but to remain in Gondolin as servants until their life's end. In response, the brethren swore oaths to never to reveal the counsels of Turgon and to keep secret all that they had seen in his realm.<ref name=\"coh\" />\n\nThe Eagles then carried the brothers off at night, and set them down in Dor-lómin by dawn of the next day. Their kinsfolk rejoiced, as it was believed that they had been captured or slain, but the brothers would speak only that they had been rescued by the Eagles who had brought them home. When questioned by Galdor, who noted that they \"found food and fine raiment, and return as young princes, not as waifs of the wood\" Húrin shared further only that their return was permitted through an oath of silence, which they were still under. While Galdor did not press the matter, he and many others guessed at the truth, for both the the Eagles and the oath pointed to Turgon.<ref name=\"coh\" /> The strange fortune of the brothers, and their rumoured friendship with Turgon, became widely known, and reached the ears of the servants of Morgoth.<ref>{{GA|166}}</ref>\n\n===Last days of the House of Hador===\nIn {{FA|462|n}},<ref>{{GA|171}}</ref> Morgoth renewed his assault and threw a great force against King [[Fingon]] in Hithlum. The Orcs won many of the passes, besieged Fingon's fortress of [[Eithel Sirion]], and even came into Mithrim. Galdor, serving as captain in at Eithel Sirion in Fingon's stead,<ref name=\"coh\" /> was slain by an arrow.<ref name=\"lr156\">{{LR|Quenta}}</ref>{{rp|§156}} Húrin then took up his lordship and command, with \"a fire in him that made the sword hot in his hand\". Behind Fingon and Hürin the Orcs were driven with great slaughter from the land, and pursued far even into [[Anfauglith]].<ref name=\"coh\" /><ref name=\"lr156\" />\n\nIn {{FA|468|n}}, with the [[quest for the Silmaril|retrieval of a Silmaril]] by [[Lúthien]] and [[Beren]] proving that Morgoth was not unassailable, the Elf-lord [[Maedhros]] assembled a [[Union of Maedhros|great union]] to oppose him, and soon cleared Beleriand of Orcs, restoring the frontiers to as they were prior to the Dagor Bragollach.\n\nIn {{FA|472|n}}, during the first days of spring, Huor wedded [[Rían]], the daughter of [[Belegund]] of the [[House of Bëor]], and they soon conceived a son who Huor named \"[[Tuor]]\" even before his birth. Two months following their wedding the summons came for the mustering of the hosts, and Huor and Húrin marched away in the army of Fingon.<ref>{{GA|218}}</ref>\n\nThe day of battle was decided to be the morning of Midsummer, and on that day came forces from many realms and lords. Within Fingon's assembled host, the Men of Dor-lómin under Húrin and Huor were placed on the right, joined by Men of Brethil under their uncle Haldir. Unlooked for, Turgon also arrived, having opened his leaguer to fight alongside his brother Fingon.<ref name=\"ch2\">{{CH|2}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Battle of Unnumbered Tears|ensuing battle]], however, proved disastrous, and in the days that followed Morgoth's forces broke those of the Elves and Men that opposed him. Húrin and Huor stood, leading the remnant of the House of Hador, stood with Turgon and urged that he withdraw; as the last of the House of Fingolfin, in him lay the last hope of [[Eldar]]. Huor further prophesied, with the eyes of death, that from he and Turgon \"a new star shall arise\". Maeglin, who stood with Turgon, heard these words and did not forget them.<ref name=\"ch2\">{{CH|2}}</ref>\n\nAs Turgon withdrew the Men of Dor-lómin provided rearguard, as desired by Húrin and Huor; they did not wish to escape from their lands, and if they could not win back their homes, they would stand to the end. After Turgon passed through the guard of Húrin and Huor, he passed down the Sirion and escaped. Húrin and Huor, however, drew what remained of the House of Hador and, foot by foot withdrew until they passed behind the [[Fen of Serech]] and held the stream of [[Rivil]] in front of them. There the hosts of Angband were slain in numbers such that they bridged the stream with their dead, but yet they managed to cross and encircle the Men of Dor-lómin. As the sunset, Huor was slain by a venomed arrow to the eye, while his men were slain about him. The Orcs then hewed off their heads and piled them as a mound of gold.<ref name=\"ch2\" /> Huor's remains were then likely taken and piled into the [[Hill of the Slain]].<ref name=\"UT\">{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\nAt Morgoth's orders, Húrin was taken alive and, after defying Morgoth's command to betray Turgon, he and his kin were cursed.\n\nThe lands of Dor-lómin were given to the [[Easterlings_(First_Age)|Easterling]] Men who betrayed Maedhros and they became known as the \"Incomers\". They were cruel to remaining folk of the House of Hador, seizing property and enslaving many.\n\nRían, seeking for Huor, ventured alone into the wild. There she would have perished if not succoured by the remaining [[Elves of Mithrim]] who led her to relative safety where she gave birth to Tuor. She soon departed again though, leaving Tuor in the care of the Elves and making her way to the Hill of the Slain where she lay down and died.\n\nTuor grew up among the Elves, but was captured and enthralled as a youth by the Incomers. He eventually managed to escape, became a messenger of Ulmo, and came to Gondolin to deliver a warning to Turgon to abandon the city. Though Turgon did not heed this warning, Tuor was placed in high-esteem and married Turgon's daughter, [[Idril]], with whom they bore a son, [[Eärendil]]. Tuor, Idril, and Eärendil managed to escape when a few years later [[Fall of Gondolin|Gondolin fell]].\n\nEärendil would go on to became one of the greatest heroes of Elves and Men. Following many adventures, he bore the Silmaril and sailed to [[Valinor]] where he plead for Elves and Men and instigated the [[War of Wrath]] which saw Morgoth overthrown. Eärendil was then placed by the [[Valar]] to sail in the skies, Silmaril still on his brow, as the [[Star of Eärendil]].\n\n==Characteristics==\nHuor was the tallest of all the Edain save his own son Tuor only, and a swift runner.<ref>{{UT|2a}}</ref> He was noted as wielding an axe.<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}</ref> He was likely golden-haired and blue-eyed, as were many of the people of Hador.<ref>{{WJ|West}}</ref>{{rp|§33}}\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Huor.mp3|Ardamir}}\nThe name ''Huor'' was adapted to [[Sindarin]] from the language of the [[Edain]].<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, pp. 348, 364 (note 49)</ref>\n\nIn the [[The Etymologies|''Etymologies'']], [[Noldorin]] ''Huor'' (\"'heart-vigour', courage\") derives from [[Common Eldarin]] ''Khō-gorē'' ([[Sundocarme|root]] KHŌ-N- \"heart (physical)\").
