Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, Charles Williams, Owen Barfield''''' is a book by Gareth Knight, first published in [[1990]] and republished in a second edition on [[20 October]] [[2010]]. \n\n==Editorial Reviews==\n\n\"Because of the combination of information, understanding and insight on which it is founded, The Magical World of the [[Inklings]] is more than outstanding. It is not in the same league with anything else I have come across.\" - [[Owen Barfield]].\n\n\n\"It is only recently that the full play of Lewis's neo-Platonism is reaching a wider public. Nobody has more revealingly shown the occultic and mythical character of this world-view, and its influence on Lewis's fiction, than did Gareth Knight in his superb book The Magical World of the Inklings.\" - Dr Andrew Walker, Director of the Centre for Theology and Culture, King's College London.\n\n{{title|italics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Magical World of the Inklings, The}}\n[[Category:Biography books]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
