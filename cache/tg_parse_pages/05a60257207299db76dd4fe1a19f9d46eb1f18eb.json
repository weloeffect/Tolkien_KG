And when I say die-hard, I wasn't the person who could speak Elvish, but I really loved them. And I wasn't actually going to see the original films, because I didn't think it was possible that a film could represent the books appropriately...And then my family all took a jaunt together...to see the movies, and were like, \"What, you're just going to stay home?\" \n\nSo I saw the movies and was thoroughly impressed that Peter Jackson managed to make my vision of the book come to life, as well as my sister's and my father's, and my aunt's and my uncle's, everyone's. It seemed to somehow pan across everyone's vision, even though we all knew we had to have had different visions of the books.|Evangeline Lilly, Collider}}\n==Awards==\n*[[2013]] - '''[http://www.mtv.com/ MTV Movie Award]''', Best Fight, ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]''\n\n{{References}}\n==External links==\n*{{WP|Evangeline Lilly}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lilly, Evangeline}}\n[[Category:Actors and actresses]]\n[[Category:Canadian people]]\n[[Category:People by name]]\n[[Category:The Hobbit (film series) cast]]\n\n[[fi:Evangeline Lilly]]"}}}
