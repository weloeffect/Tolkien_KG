It was translated by [[Stella M. Mills]], a pupil of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], and the book was dedicated to [[E.V. Gordon]], Tolkien, and [[Wikipedia:Charles Talbut Onions|C.T. Onions]].\n\nIn [[2012]], the book was reprinted by [[Douglas A. Anderson]]'s publishing firm [[Nodens Books]], with a new Foreword by [[Priscilla Tolkien]].\n\n==From the publisher==\n\n{{blockquote|Stella Marie Mills (1903-1989) was born and raised in Leeds. She studied at Leeds University under J.R.R. Tolkien and his close friend and colleague E.V. Gordon, receiving her B.A. with Honours in English in 1924. Tolkien helped her to secure employment at the Oxford English Dictionary under C.T. Onions, and later she taught at the St. Joseph's Catholic Primary School in Oxford, and at the Catholic Teacher Training College, Maria Assumpta, in Kensington. Her only publication was her translation from the Old Norse, completed at Leeds under Gordon's supervision, of ''The Saga of Hrolf Kraki'', originally published in 1933 and dedicated to Gordon, Tolkien and Onions. Tolkien’s familiarity with ''The Saga of Hrolf Kraki'' can be seen in certain aspects of ''The Hobbit'', particularly in the character Beorn the shape-changer, whose literary antecedents from this saga include Bothvar Bjarki (the \"little bear\") and his father Bjorn, who metamophose into bears. Stella Mills became a life-long friend of the Tolkien family, and that friendship is memorialized in this reprint of ''The Saga of Hrolf Kraki'' in a reminiscence by Priscilla Tolkien.|<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130210053013/http://www.nodensbooks.com/2012/07/new-release-stella-m-millss-translation.html|articlename=New Release: Stella M.
