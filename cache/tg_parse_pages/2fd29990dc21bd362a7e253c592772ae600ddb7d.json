This book looks into [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s early life, examining more specifically the influence of the [[World War I|Great War]] on Tolkien and his writings.\n\nThe book was warmly welcomed by Tolkien scholars as filling in an important gap in biographical coverage. Christian scholars too admired the book, though [[Ralph C. Wood]] thought that it underplayed the importance of [[Christianity|Tolkien's Christianity]]. The book was called \"plodding\" by Tolkien's biographer, [[Humphrey Carpenter]],<ref>[https://alt.fan.tolkien.narkive.com/HRvnBGEu/humphrey-carpenter-reviews-tolkien-and-the-great-war Humphrey Carpenter reviews \"Tolkien and the Great War\"] archived on narkive.com (accessed 23 April 2024)</ref> but praised by other commentators.\n\nThe book won the 2004 [[Wikipedia:Mythopoeic Awards|Mythopoeic Scholarship Award in Inklings Studies]].\n\nThe book contains reprints of passages from early poetry by Tolkien, among them the full text of the poem \"''[[The Lonely Isle]]''\", originally published in ''[[Leeds University Verse 1914-24]]'' in [[1924]]. There are also numerous quotes from unpublished correspondence between Tolkien, [[Christopher Wiseman]], [[Robert Quilter Gilson|R.Q. Gilson]], and [[Geoffrey Bache Smith|G.B. Smith]].\n\n==Contents==\n*Preface\n\n*Part One: ''The immortal four''\n**Prologue\n**1. Before\n**2. A young man with too much imagination\n**3. The Council of London\n**4.

Tolkien’s wartime experiences and their impact on his life and his writing of The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings.<br><br>\n“To be caught in youth by 1914 was no less hideous an experience than in 1939 … by 1918 all but one of my close friends were dead.”<br><br>\nSo J.R.R. Tolkien responded to critics who saw The Lord of the Rings as a reaction to the Second World War. Tolkien and the Great War tells for the first time the full story of how he embarked on the creation of Middle-earth in his youth as the world around him was plunged into catastrophe. This biography reveals the horror and heroism that he experienced as a signals officer in the Battle of the Somme and introduces the circle of friends who spurred his mythology to life. It shows how, after two of these brilliant young men were killed, Tolkien pursued the dream they had all shared by launching his epic of good and evil.<br><br>\nJohn Garth argues that the foundation of tragic experience in the First World War is the key to Middle-earth’s enduring power. Tolkien used his mythic imagination not to escape from reality but to reflect and transform the cataclysm of his generation. While his contemporaries surrendered to disillusionment, he kept enchantment alive, reshaping an entire literary tradition into a form that resonates to this day.<br><br>\nThis is the first substantially new biography of Tolkien since 1977, meticulously researched and distilled from his personal wartime papers and a multitude of other sources.}}\n\n==Publication history and gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"125px\" heights=\"125px\">\nFile:Great War 2003.png|2003 hardcover\nFile:Great War 2004.png|2004 paperback\nFile:Great War 2011.png|2004 paperback<br>?th impression\n</gallery>\n*[[HarperCollins]] hardcover ([[2003]]), pp.&nbsp;416.
