Though it was counted one of the lesser of the seven [[Seeing-stones]] brought into [[Middle-earth]], it was nonetheless the one used most often by the King in the north, and was preserved at [[Annúminas]] through the history of the realms of Arnor and its successor [[Arthedain]]. \n\nWhen [[Angmar]]'s forces overran [[Arthedain]], its last King, [[Arvedui]], saved the Stone of Annúminas, along with [[Amon Sûl-stone|the ''palantír'']] that had been kept in the Tower of [[Weathertop|Amon Sûl]]. With these and other heirlooms, he fled into the far north, where he was given shelter by the [[Lossoth]], the [[Snowmen of Forochel|Snowmen]] of the north. At last a ship from the [[Grey Havens]] came to rescue Arvedui, but after he had boarded, its hull was crushed by the ice, and all aboard were lost. The Stone of Annúminas, along with that of Amon Sûl, were lost in the shipwreck, and sank beneath the cold waters of the Icebay of [[Forochel]]. \n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Annúminas-stone was used by [[Mordirith]] in [[Carn Dûm]] to communicate with [[Sauron]]. It was never explained how it came into his possession. While in battle with the Ranger [[Golodir]], the [[palantír]] is stolen by [[Amarthiel]]. She brings it to [[Barad Gularan]] and communicates with Sauron that she is now the Steward of Angmar. \n:She brings the ''palantír'' back to [[Annúminas]] and locates her lesser ring, [[Narchuil]]. The Rangers of [[Evendim]] are able to take the ''palantír'' away from her. They eventually bring it to [[Elrond]] in [[Rivendell]]. \n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Images of palantíri|Images of ''palantíri'']]\n\n{{Palantiri}}\n[[Category:Arnor]]"}}}
