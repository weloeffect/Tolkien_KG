Therefore, Sauron humbled himself before Ar-Pharazôn, and was brought to Númenor as a prisoner. Three years later, he soon used \"the cunning of his mind\" to become the primary councillor of Ar-Pharazôn and corrupted the minds of [[King's Men|most of his people]], so that they turned to the worship of the [[Darkness (concept)|Darkness]] and Melkor its Lord. Unable for the time being to claim personal divine status anew, Sauron preached deliverance from death and promise of power through an unseen object of worship: his old master, [[Melkor]].<ref>{{MR|P5VII}}, \"(i) Notes on motives in ''the Silmarillion''\"</ref> After the [[Númenóreans]] fully embraced the adoration of the Darkness, Sauron commanded for a mighty Temple to be built on a hill in the middle of Armenelos.<ref name=\"silm\" />\n\nThe Temple had a circular foundation and walls that were five-hundred feet high and fifty-feet thick at the base; it was five-hundred feet in diameter. The Temple was roofed by a mighty [[silver]] dome which could be seen at a distance due to how it glittered when it was struck by sunlight. However, the dome was soon blackened from the smoke of rituals, as the structure's innermost sanctum contained an altar of fire in its center. There was a louver at the uttermost top of the dome that let out a great smoke regularly. The first sacrifice made on the altar of fire was the chopped-up wood of [[Nimloth of Númenor|Nimloth]]. For seven days afterwards, the city was covered in a cloud before it dispersed and passed away toward the west, though the reek of the burning was admired by many Númenóreans.<ref name=\"silm\" />\n\n[[File:John Howe - The Drowning of Anadûné.jpg|left|thumb|''The Drowning of Anadûne'' by [[John Howe]]]]\n\nSoon afterwards, the King's Men began making human sacrifices upon the altar, hoping that Melkor would release them from the [[Gift of Ilúvatar]], but they did not escape the fate of [[Men]] by making these bloody offerings. Many of these sacrifice victims were among the [[Faithful]], though they were never sentenced openly based on their rejection of Morgoth alone. Because of the worship of Morgoth, the skies above Númenor became increasingly engulfed by thunderclouds shaped like [[Eagles]], which often brought death. Sauron laughed when he heard these storms. During one such storm, \"a fiery bolt smote the dome of the Temple and shore it asunder\", causing it to catch fire. The Temple, however, was itself unaffected, since Sauron stood atop the dome, defying the lightning and remaining unharmed. As a result, the King's Men believed him to be a [[god]] and obeyed him without question.<ref name=\"silm\" />\n\nAs Ar-Pharazôn's [[Great Armament]] departed for war, Sauron remained in the innermost circle of the Temple, laughing at the fleet's trumpets of war before demanding more victims for sacrifices. Sometime afterwards, some soldiers of Sauron went to [[Rómenna]] to drag [[Elendil]] himself to the Temple; he avoided them before setting sail for [[Middle-earth]].<ref name=\"silm\" />\n\nIn {{SA|3319}},<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref> nine-hundred-and-thirteen days after the Great Armament set sail, \"fire burst from the [[Meneltarma]]\" and even while Sauron laughed at finally having gotten rid of the [[Edain]], the black seat he was sitting in and even the Temple itself were cast \"into the abyss\" that [[Eru]] had made; thus, the Dark Lord's physical form was caught in the ruins, but his spirit survived the [[Downfall of Númenor|catastrophe]] and later returned to [[Mordor]].<ref name=\"silm\" />\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nIn an earlier version of the [[legendarium]], the Temple, referred to at one point as the '''Temple for Morgoth''', was built atop the [[Hallow of Eru|summit]] of [[Meneltarma]] after all the trees upon it were felled. The Temple is described as \"wonderful, but terrible\" and was made out of marble, [[gold]], glass, and steel. Sauron surveyed the land from the Temple, dwelling there until [[Alkar]] returned, or so he claimed. Beneath the Temple were prisons and chambers of torture and the smoke that rose from the top of the Temple withered any flowers and grass that it touched.<ref name=early>{{LR|P1III2}}</ref>\n\n== Inspiration ==\nIt is possible [[J.R.R.
