It lay in the northern corner of the [[Southfarthing]], some miles south of the [[Three-Farthing Stone]], in that hilly part of the Shire known as the [[Green Hill Country]]. It seems to have been built in the southern slopes of the [[Green Hills]], and was reached by only a single road, apparently leading from the larger settlement of [[Longbottom]] to the south.<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nConcerning the origin of Pincup's name, the first element is ''pinnuc'' or ''pink'', finch or sparrow, and the second element is ''hop'', recess, retreat. Tolkien had said that it emulates \"a well-known pattern\" of English place-names, \"containing  bird/animal name and ''hop''|.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. lix</ref>\n\nBefore the above publication, [[David Salo]] had suggested a derivation from a speculative [[Old English]] *''Pincopp'' \"pine-hill\", among other possibilities.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=https://tolkienlistsearch.herokuapp.com/message/5e9c35b63ee6a6c41e9862d6|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]|accessed=9 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Cities, towns and villages of the Shire]]\n\n[[de:Felsmulde]]\n[[fi:Pinkkala]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/villes tours et forteresses/comte/pincup]]"}}}
