East and north of [[Menegroth]] there was a dark valley and down its northern side the river cascaded in a steep torrent.\n\nDuring the [[Hunting of the Wolf]] [[Carcharoth]] came into the land of [[Doriath]]. He was able to do so, overcoming the [[Girdle of Melian]], because he had a [[Silmaril]] within his belly, which burned and drove him to madness. Coming to the foot of the falls he drank to quench his thirst and for a moment the sweet waters eased his pain. [[Beren]], [[Thingol]], and [[Huan]] the Hound drew near the thicket where the wolf hid after quenching his thirst. Carcharoth burst upon the Man and the Elf, but Huan leaped upon the wolf's back. Between the baying of Huan and the howling of Carcharoth the rocks cracked and fell from the sides of the valley and choked the falls.<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Beleriand]]\n[[Category:Falls]]"}}}
