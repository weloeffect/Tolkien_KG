It was first used by Sauron's forces during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Grond was drawn to the Great Gate by \"[[great beasts]]\" and was wielded by [[mountain-trolls]]. It was used against the Great Gate because it was the weakest point on the wall of Minas Tirith. The first attempt was unsuccessful, the gate swung and a boom went through the city but the gate stood. Then the [[Black Captain]] cried out thrice and with each cry the ram hit against the gate and finally on the third Grond broke through and the gates burst open allowing Sauron's forces to enter Minas Tirith.\n\n==Description==\nGrond was a battering ram in the shape of a wolf's head. It was made of black steel making it fireproof and held up by steel chains. Grond was \"great as a forest tree a hundred feet in length\". It is told that Grond had been induced with \"[[Magic|spells]] of ruin\".<ref name=\"RKV4\">{{RK|V4}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Grond'' means \"very weighty and ponderous\" in [[Sindarin]].<ref>{{PE|17}}, pp. 99, 183</ref> It was named intentionally to evoke the memory of the ancient weapon of [[Morgoth]], the \"[[Grond (Hammer of the Underworld)|Hammer of the Underworld]]\".<ref name=RKV4/>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Grond in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Return of the King (1980 film) - Grond.png|Grond, as portrayed in [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King - Grond.jpg|Grond, as portrayed in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' \nFile:Aragorn's Quest - PSP3.jpg|Grond, as portrayed in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest]]''\nFile:Lord of the Rings Online - Grond.jpg|Grond, as portrayed in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\nFile:Ramazan Kazaliev - Grond, the Gatebreaker.jpg|Grond, the Gatebreaker, as portrayed in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-earth]]''\n</gallery>\n\n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''\n:The ram took the shape of the whole wolf's body, rather of just its head. [[Gothmog (Lieutenant of Morgul)|Gothmog]] called it in after a smaller battering ram proved futile against the great gates.\n\n'''2015: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Grond was encountered in the Epic Quest \"The Strength of Sauron Book 3: Chapter 8: Gothmog Appears\". The player managed to slightly damage the great ram, delaying its use in the coming battle. [[Gothmog]]'s arrival forced the player to withdraw before further damage could be done.\n\n{{References}}\n{{Title}}\n[[Category:Weapons]]\n[[de:Grond (Riesenramme)]]\n[[fr:/encyclo/artefacts/armes/grond_d_angband]]\n[[fi:Grond (muurinmurtaja)]]"}}}
