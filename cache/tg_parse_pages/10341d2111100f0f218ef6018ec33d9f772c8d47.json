He was fat and red-bearded and enjoyed a slow, comfortable life. Then one day a rather deaf and short-sighted giant blundered on to his land…<br/>\nThe Adventures of Tom Bombadil collects hobbit-verses from the ‘Red Book’ and other poems relating legends and jests of the Shire at the end of the Third Age.<br/>\nSmith of Wootton Major tells of the preparation of the Great Cake to mark the Feast of Good Children and the magical events which follow.<br/>\nRoverandom is a real dog who is magically transformed into a toy and is forced to seek out the wizard who wronged him in order to be returned to normal. The story was written to console Tolkien's four-year-old son, Michael, who lost a beloved toy dog on the beach.}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[The Middle-earth Treasury]] boxed set\n\n{{title|italics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tolkien Treasury, The}}\n[[Category:Fiction books]]\n[[Category:Books by J.R.R.
