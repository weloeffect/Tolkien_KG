From this spot the Sirion flowed south and then slightly east, skirting the plains, to the [[Fen of Serech]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref> There was a pass west of Eithel Sirion through the mountains that led to [[Mithrim]].<ref name=\"Return\">{{S|Return}}</ref>\n\nAfter [[Fëanor]] had been mortally wounded by [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]] his sons carried him away from [[Dor Daedeloth]]. As they began climbing the pass near Eithel Sirion, Fëanor had them stop, he cursed [[Morgoth]] three times, and then he died. As it left, Fëanor's fiery spirit consumed his body to ash; no tomb was made for him there or elsewhere.<ref name=\"Return\"/>\n\n[[Fingolfin]] built a great fortress in this location called [[Barad Eithel]], from whence a watch was kept upon the plains. However, in the [[Dagor Bragollach]] a host of Morgoth's assailed this place and other fortresses of the Ered Wethrin. Near the Eithel Sirion [[Hador|Hador Lórindol]] and his son [[Gundor]] fell in [[Fingolfin]]'s rearguard. Morgoth withdrew his forces after the Dagor Bragollach, but sent a new host against [[Hithlum]] seven years later. Again the Eithel Sirion and its fortress was a main point of contention and here [[Galdor (Lord of Dor-lómin)|Galdor of Dor-lómin]] fell.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the Fifth Battle, the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], [[Fingon]] kept watch from the walls of the Barad Eithel for the beacon that would signal the start of the war. At the bidding of [[Húrin]], Fingon held back his strength while the host of Morgoth marched up to the Eithel Sirion. Before the walls of the fortress [[Gelmir (son of Guilin)|Gelmir]], son of [[Guilin]], was cruelly slain. This enraged his brother [[Gwindor]] who charged from the Eithel Sirion on horseback.<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Eithel Sirion'' is [[Sindarin]] for \"Sirion's Well\",<ref>{{S|Index}}, entry \"Eithel Sirion\"</ref> from ''[[eithel]]'' (\"spring, well\").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entry ''[[eithel]]''</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Noldorin locations]]\n[[Category:Rivers of Beleriand]]\n[[Category:Springs and wells]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[de:Eithel Sirion]]\n[[fi:Eithel Sirion]]\n[[fr:encyclo:geographie:eaux:beleriand:eithel sirion]]"}}}
