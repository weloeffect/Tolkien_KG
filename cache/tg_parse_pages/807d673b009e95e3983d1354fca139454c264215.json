The [[Hobbits]] eagerly asked questions about the [[Paths of the Dead]].<ref>{{RK|Company}}</ref> Gimli refused to speak of the experience, but Legolas described it. According to Legolas, after setting out from the Paths of the Dead, [[Aragorn]] led the Company and the army of the [[Oathbreakers|Dead]] to the Great River, [[Anduin]]. Invading fleets of [[Sauron]]'s allies prevented thousands of potential defenders from reaching [[Minas Tirith]]. At Aragorn's command, the legion of Dead had swept over the Enemy’s ships, causing the terrified sailors to throw themselves overboard. Aragorn had released the Dead from their curse and then, gathering the local [[Men]] of [[Lamedon]], set sail for Minas Tirith. At the end of the tale, Gimli and Legolas expressed their wonder that [[Mordor]]’s allies were overthrown by darkness and fear.<ref>{{RK|Battle}}</ref>\n\nWhile the four companions shared their stories, Aragorn held a meeting of the lords in his tent outside the city. [[Gandalf]] told the assembled captains that Mordor had not yet unleashed the greater part of its army. Though Minas Tirith had fought back the first assault, the next would be much stronger. In addition, the [[The One Ring|Ring of Power]] was now somewhere within the borders of Mordor.<ref>{{TT|Choices}}</ref> Should Sauron seize it, all hope would be lost. Gandalf suggested an assault on the [[Black Gate]] of Mordor, reasoning that it was impossible to defeat Mordor without destroying the Ring, and that the [[Eye of Sauron]] must be diverted from the [[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]] as long as possible. Gandalf predicted that Sauron would think that Aragorn had taken possession of the Ring and, rash with pride, had chosen to attack Mordor. Gandalf believed that while attacking Mordor may prove fatal, it was their duty to defend against evil while it remained in their power to do so. The Captains agreed to this plan.\n==Composition==\nThe chapter was probably reworked in [[September]]-[[October]] [[1946]]. In an earlier draft of the chapter, Aragorn was narrating all his journey from [[Helm's Deep]] as a \"flash back\". In the published version, the scenes of the [[Paths of the Dead]] up to [[Erech]], became part of the narration and were moved to [[The Passing of the Grey Company|a new chapter]].<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. xxvii</ref>\n{{references}}\n[[Category:The Return of the King chapters|Last Debate]]"}}}
