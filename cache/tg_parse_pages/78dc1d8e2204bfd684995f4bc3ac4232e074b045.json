and indeed greatest in skill among them was Celebrimbor, son of [[Curufin]]...|''[[The Silmarillion]]'', \"[[Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age]]\"}}\n\n'''Celebrimbor''' was the [[Elves|elf]] that forged the [[Three Rings]], mighty artifacts whose existence shaped the history of the [[Second Age|Second]] and [[Third Age]]s of [[Middle-earth]]. As a craftsman, he was second only to [[Fëanor]],<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref> his grandfather.<ref name=PMXnotes/>\n\n==History==\n=== First Age ===\n[[File:Jenny Dolfen - Celebrimbor.jpg|thumb|left|''Celebrimbor'' by [[Jenny Dolfen]]]]\nCelebrimbor was born in [[Aman]] during the [[Years of the Trees]]. Among [[Fëanor]]'s [[Sons of Fëanor|seven sons]], Celebrimbor's father [[Curufin]] was the chief inheritor of Fëanor's temperament and skills in craftsmanship.<ref name=Curufin>{{PM|XI7}}, p. 352</ref> In turn, Curufin passed these skills – but not this temper – on to Celebrimbor.<ref name=PMXnotes/>\n\nFollowing the [[Darkening of Valinor]], Celebrimbor followed Fëanor into exile in [[Middle-earth]].<ref name=Nol>{{S|9}}, p. 37</ref> His unnamed mother remained behind with the people of [[Finarfin]].<ref name=PMXnotes/> Celebrimbor did not swear the [[Oath of Fëanor]]. It is unknown whether he took part in the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë]]. It is also unknown whether he crossed the [[Belegaer]] in one of the stolen Falmari ships or if he followed [[Fingolfin]] across the [[Helcaraxë]].\n\nCelebrimbor's whereabouts in Beleriand in the early [[Years of the Sun]] are unattested, but later events suggest that he dwelt with his father Curufin and uncle [[Celegorm]] in their realm of [[Himlad]].<ref>{{S|14}}, p. 58</ref> The realm lasted until the [[Dagor Bragollach]] in {{FA|455}}, in which [[Morgoth]] broke the [[Siege of Angband]]. After this defeat, Curufin and Celegorm fled to the southwest with many of their people, including Celebrimbor,<ref name=PMXnotes/> and took refuge with [[Finrod Felagund]] in his realm of [[Nargothrond]].<ref>{{S|18}}</ref>\n\nThough they were but refugees and guests in Nargothrond, Curufin and Celegorm sought power, and they quickly gained great influence among the people. For his part, Celebrimbor was not involved in his father's schemes and came to love Finrod.<ref name=PMXnotes/> \n\nIn {{FA|465}},<ref>{{GA|192}}, p. 65</ref> the brothers' [[Quest for the Silmaril|political machinations]] forced Finrod to surrender his crown to [[Orodreth]] and leave his realm. Their dominance would prove short-lived. Later that same year, captives freed from the dungeons of [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]] returned to Nargothrond and spoke against the brothers, revealing their treachery and turning the people against them. Orodreth would not suffer them to be slain and so exiled them from the realm.<ref name=Oro>{{S|19}}</ref>\n\nWhen Celebrimbor learned the truth of his father and uncle's actions, he was \"aghast\" and parted ways with them. He was not subject to their exile and did not voluntarily follow them.<ref name=PMXnotes/> His whereabouts for the remainder of the First Age are unknown.\n\n=== Second Age ===\n{{expansion}}\n==== Establishment of Eregion and the forging of the Rings of Power ====\nThe whereabouts of Celebrimbor during the early years of the [[Second Age]] are uncertain, but at some point, he became a great friend to [[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]],<ref name=PMXnotes/> and in {{SA|750}},<ref>{{App|SA}}, entry for the year 750, p. 1083</ref> Celebrimbor with many others of the exiled Noldor followed them to establish the realm of [[Eregion]] near to [[Khazad-dûm]], the mansions of the [[Longbeards|Longbeard]] [[Dwarves]]. This they did due to the discovery of ''[[mithril]]'' in the surrounding mountains.<ref name=SA>{{App|SA}}, p. 1082</ref>\n\nEventually, a great friendship arose between the Elves of Eregion and the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, such that was never before seen, and Celebrimbor became the [[Lord of Eregion]]<ref name=SA/> and the greatest of the [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain]], \"People of the Jewel-smiths\", who in their skill were second only to Fëanor, Celebrimbor's grandfather. There, Celebrimbor befriended [[Narvi|Narvi the Dwarf]],<ref name=\":0\"/> who built the [[Doors of Durin]], and Celebrimbor inscribed the words upon it.<ref name=Dark>{{FR|Journey}}, p. 306</ref>\n\nHowever, in {{SA|1200}}, [[Sauron]], under the fair guise of ''[[Annatar]]'', came to Eriador posing as an emissary of the [[Valar]]. He was rejected by [[Gil-galad]], the [[High King of the Noldor]], in [[Lindon]] (where he was not even admitted to), but although Galadriel did not trust him and treated him with scorn, he was nonetheless accepted by the smiths of Eregion, for Celebrimbor desired in his heart to rival the skill and fame of Fëanor. Galadriel and Celeborn were eventually stripped of their authority in Eregion, and this was largely due to the machinations of Sauron. Galadriel, with her daughter [[Celebrían]], departed for the Elvish realm of [[Lothlórien|Lórien]], while Celeborn, due to his dislike of all Dwarves and not wanting to cross through their mansions in Khazad-dûm, remained behind in Eregion, and he was largely ignored by Celebrimbor and Annatar thereafter.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn c. {{SA|1500}}, the Gwaith-i-Mírdain reached the height of their skill under the instruction of Sauron and began forging the [[Rings of Power]].\n\n==== The War of the Elves and Sauron and death ====\nCelebrimbor was ignorant of Sauron's true intentions, and he was unaware that Sauron had incorporated a binding magic into the rings. Furthermore, in secret, Sauron forged the [[One Ring]], a master ring that would rule all the lesser rings, to enable him to rule Middle-earth by controlling those that wore all the other rings. When Sauron placed the One Ring on his finger, claiming dominance over all the [[Rings of Power]] and their bearers, the Elves knew his true identity and intentions. Celebrimbor and the Elves of Eregion defied Sauron by withholding the other rings from him. Aside from the One Ring, the greatest rings were created by Celebrimbor himself, and these were never touched by Sauron and thus were uncorrupted by him, although they were still subject to the One Ring. These were the Three Rings of the Elves, and a chief source of the beauty that came about in the [[Third Age]]. Celebrimbor named them [[Vilya]], [[Narya]], and [[Nenya]] after the Middle-earth elements of air, fire and water. He sent the three rings to Elf-lords for safekeeping: Vilya and Narya to Gil-galad in Lindon; and Nenya to Galadriel. Celebrimbor also sent the mightiest of the seven to [[Durin III]] of Khazad-dûm.<ref>{{App|Durin}}, p. 1076</ref>\n\nSauron retaliated by attacking Eregion, laying waste to the realm.

Speak friends and enter. And underneath very small and now faint is: [[Narvi#Other versions of the legendarium|Narfi]] made them.

There, the name is given under the root [[KWAR]] (\"clutching hand, fist\"), and Celebrimbor's name was explained as meaning \"Silver-fist\" in [[Noldorin]] (which was a precursor language to [[Sindarin]]).<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry '''KWAR-''', p. 366</ref>\n\nHowever, even though no origin of Celebrimbor was published until the second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' in [[1966]], Tolkien did in fact write one in the 1950s, which can be found in the next section of the article.\n\n=== ''Concerning Galadriel & Celeborn'' and ''The Elessar'' ===\nThe first known origin story of Celebrimbor was written by Tolkien in c. [[1959]], occurring in a text called ''[[Concerning Galadriel & Celeborn]]''. There, Celebrimbor was described as an [[Gondolindrim|Elf]] of [[Gondolin]] (and one of [[Turgon]]'s \"greatest artificers\"), who, after the end of the First Age and the overthrow of Morgoth, became a follower of Celeborn and Galadriel,<ref name=Con>{{UT|Concerning}}, p. 235</ref> who were regarded as the \"High Lord and Lady of all the Eldar of the West\".<ref>{{NM|P3xvi}}, p. 347</ref>\n\nAfter the establishment of Eregion,<ref group=note>This text states that the building of Ost-in-Edhil, the capital of Eregion, was begun in {{SA|750}}.</ref> Celebrimbor became the \"chief craftsman of Eregion\" with an \"almost 'dwarvish' obsession with crafts\", and befriended the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, of whom a dwarven craftsman called [[Narvi]] was his greatest friend<ref name=Con/> - from that friendship both Eregion and Khazad-dûm profited greatly.\n\nIn c. {{SA|1000}}, Sauron established himself in [[Mordor]], and sent emissaries to Eriador, before finally appearing there himself, in his fairest form, in {{SA|1200}}. However, he was rejected by Gil-galad in [[Lindon]], and after heading to Eregion, was likewise rejected by Galadriel and Celeborn, the original rulers of Eregion in this conception of the legendarium.<ref name=Ceb>{{UT|Concerning}}, p. 236</ref>\n\nBut even though Celeborn and Galadriel (who he perceived to be his chief obstacle) rejected him, Sauron, posing as an emissary of the Valar, nonetheless managed to convince Celebrimbor and the rest of the Noldorin smiths of Eregion, who by this time have formed a powerful guild called the [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain]], to accept his help in the forging of the Rings of Power;<ref name=Bor>{{UT|Concerning}}, pp. 236-7</ref> here Tolkien states that the story of Fëanor was repeated.\n\nTherefore, Celebrimbor and his followers (under the influence of Sauron) rebelled against Galadriel and Celeborn,<ref group=note>In this text, it is said that Celebrimbor was \"secretly anxious to rival the skill and fame of Fëanor\".</ref> and, sometime between {{SA|1350}} and {{SA|1400|n}}, Galadriel withdrew from Eregion and went to [[Lórinand]] (which would later be known as ''Lórien''), via Khazad-dûm, and took up rule there. However, Celeborn, owing to his distrust of the Dwarves, remained in Eregion \"disregarded by Celebrimbor\".\n\nIn c. {{SA|1500}}, Sauron left Eregion, some time after the Mírdain started crafting the Rings of Power.\n\nWhen in c. {{SA|1600}} Sauron forged the [[One Ring]], Celebrimbor finally discovered his true intentions, and he repented. Therefore he went to Lórinand to seek Galadriel's advice;<ref group=note>Tolkien wrote here that they \"should have destroyed all the Rings of Power at this time, 'but they failed to find the strength'\".</ref> she advised him to hide the [[Three Rings]] (which were the three Great Rings made solely by Celebrimbor) and send them away far from Eregion, never to be used, after which Celebrimbor gave one of them ([[Nenya]]) to her keeping. Following that, he entrusted the other two rings ([[Vilya]] and [[Narya]]) to Gil-galad in Lindon.<ref group=note>According to this text, at this time, Gil-galad gave Narya to [[Círdan]]; however, according to a later note, it is said that Gil-galad kept both rings until the [[War of the Last Alliance]].</ref>\n\nAfter Sauron learned of Celebrimbor's repentance, he invaded Eriador and besieged Eregion. And even though help was on the way, from Celeborn with his son [[Amroth]] and the [[Nandor]] of Lórinand, along with the Dwarves of Moria, ''and'' from an army sent by Gil-galad under the command of Elrond from the west, it did not arrive in time. Therefore:\n\n{{blockquote|Sauron breaks into Eregion and lays it waste. Celebrimbor is slain personally by Sauron, but Sauron does not get the Three Rings. His wrath now blazes. Elrond with all (the few) refugees from Eregion he can gather fight a vanguard action and draw away N.W. He founds a stronghold in Imladris.}}\n\nAnd:\n\n{{blockquote|When Celeborn heard of onset of Sauron (fearing to keep the Three Rings himself) he sent one to Galadriel in Lórinand by Amroth. Celeborn makes a sortie and breaks out and joins Elrond but cannot get back.}}\n\n==== ''The Elessar'' ====\nIn a text titled ''[[The Elessar]]'', written at around the same time as that of ''Concerning Galadriel & Celeborn'',<ref name=Ele>{{UT|Elessar}}, p. 251</ref> Tolkien gives two in-universe accounts of the creation of the [[Elfstone|Elessar]], a gem-stone of which it was said that:<ref name=Sar>{{UT|Elessar}}, p. 249</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|...those who looked through this stone saw things that were withered or burned healed again or as they were in the grace of their youth, and that the hands of one who held it brought to all that they touched healing from hurt.}}\n\nAccording to one of these accounts, the original Elessar was made by [[Enerdhil]], a renowned smith of [[Gondolin]], who gave it to [[Idril]] the daughter of King [[Turgon]], who in turn gave it to [[Eärendil]] her son - and so the original Elessar past into the West with him on his voyage to [[Aman]].<ref name=Sar/>\n\nMany years later,<ref group=note>Before Sauron \"deluded the smiths of Eregion\".</ref> Galadriel confided in Celebrimbor that she lamented the inevitable decay and diminishment of the lands of Middle-earth, and wished that there was some way to counteract it - because even though she was able to go West to [[Tol Eressëa]], she was still too proud to do so.<ref>{{UT|Elessar}}, p. 250</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|'I would have trees and grass about me that do not die - here in the land that is mine', she answered. 'What has become of the skill of the Eldar?' And Celebrimbor said: 'Where now is the [[Elfstone|Stone of Eärendil]]? And Enerdhil who made it is gone.' 'They have passed over Sea,' said Galadriel, 'with almost all fair things else. But must then Middle-earth fade and perish for ever?'}}\n\nTherefore Celebrimbor, who loved Galadriel (though she \"turned to Celeborn of the Trees\") began to work on making the second Elessar. Because unbeknownst to Galadriel, Celebrimbor used to be an Elf of Gondolin, and was a friend of Enerdhil, even though Enerdhil \"in most things outrivalled him\".<ref>{{UT|Elessar}}, pp. 250-1</ref>\n\nHowever, even though Celebrimbor managed to make this stone even more \"subtle and clear\" than that of Enerdhil, due to the ever present influence of Morgoth on [[Arda]] even after his defeat in the First Age, the gem's light had less power than the original - because that one captured the light of the [[Sun]] in its youth.<ref name=Ele>{{UT|Elessar}}, p. 251</ref>\n\nNonetheless, the Elessar of Celebrimbor was deemed the greatest of his works, save the [[Three Rings]] only, and:<ref name=Ele/>\n\n{{blockquote|Wielding the Elessar all things grew fair about Galadriel, until the coming of the Shadow to the Forest. But afterwards when Nenya, chief of the Three, was sent to her by Celebrimbor, she needed it (as she thought) no more, and she gave it to Celebrían her daughter, and so it came to Arwen and to Aragorn who was called Elessar.}}\n\nIn the concluding words of the text, however, Tolkien rejected the notion that the first Elessar was made by Enerdhil. Instead, ''both'' Elessars were to be creations of Celebrimbor.\n\nAccording to the final paragraph of ''The Elessar'' text, the original Elessar of Celebrimbor (which Idril received) went into the West with Eärendil, and the second one (which Galadriel received) was made by him sometime before Sauron's appearance in Eregion.<ref name=Ele/>\n\n=== ''Eldarin Hands, Fingers, and Numerals'' ===\nAccording to a late text called ''[[Eldarin Hands, Fingers, and Numerals]]'', from c. [[1968]], Tolkien changed Celebrimbor's origins from that of a grandson of Fëanor to that of a Teler of Aman (Falmar).<ref name=Eld/><ref name=Vta>{{VT|47a}}, entry '''4. Q. quár''', p. 8</ref><ref name=Nom>{{NM|P2iii}}, p. 178</ref>\n\nIn that version of his history, Celebrimbor, the \"heroic defender of Eregion in the Second-age war against Sauron\", was depicted as a great silver-smith who accompanied Celeborn in his exile to Middle-earth from Aman, along with two other Telerin elves.\n\nDuring the Second Age, he moved to Eregion due to the rumours of a \"marvellous metal\" found in Moria, which he named ''[[mithril]]''.<ref name=Eld/><ref name=Vta/><ref name=Nom/> It is said in the text that:\n\n{{blockquote|In the working of this he became a rival of the Dwarves, or rather an equal, for there was great friendship between the Dwarves of Moria and Celebrimbor, and they shared their skills and craft-secrets.}}\n\nHowever, according to his son [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher]], Tolkien most probably forgot the fact that he included Celebrimbor's origins as a descendant of Fëanor in the second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' ([[1966]]), and that, had he remembered it, he would not have changed it.<ref name=Eld>{{PM|XNotes}}, note 7, pp. 318-9</ref>\n\n==== Etymology ====\nAccording to this version of his history, the name ''Celebrimbor'' is likewise in Sindarin. However, in this text, ''Celebrimbor'' is a [[Sindarization|Sindarized]] version of his original [[Telerin]] name '''''Telperimpar''''' (with '''''Tyelpinquar''''' being its Quenya cognate).\n\nThe name was derived from the root [[KWAR]] (\"press together, squeeze, wring\"), whose derivatives were: ''[[quár]]'' ([[Quenya|Q]]), ''[[pār]]'' ([[Telerin|T]]) and ''[[paur]]'' ([[Sindarin|S]]).\n\nThe text also says that it was a common name among the Teleri of Aman, who were renowned silver-smiths.<ref name=Eld/><ref name=Vta/><ref name=Nom/>\n\n=== ''Of Dwarves and Men'' ===\nIn a late text that Christopher Tolkien called ''[[Of Dwarves and Men]]'' (from c. [[1969]]),<ref>{{PM|XIntro}}, p. 295</ref> Tolkien changed Celebrimbor's origins yet again.<ref name=Eld/>\n\nHere, Celebrimbor is depicted as a [[Sinda]] who claimed descent from [[Daeron]],<ref name=Dwa>{{PM|X}}, p. 297</ref> a famous [[Minstrels|minstrel]] and the chief loremaster of Doriath.<ref>{{S|10}}, p. 43</ref> In that text, it is explained how in Eregion, due to the influence of Celebrimbor, the ancient [[Angerthas|runic alphabet]] devised by Daeron was, along with [[Tengwar]], also known and used.\n\nAnd even though in Eregion these Runes were used mostly on formal occasions, due to the contact between the Elves of Eregion and the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, and because of the greater ease with which the Runes could be carved on stone, the Longbeard Dwarves adopted and modified them for their own use.<ref name=Dwa/>\n\n== Portrayal in adaptations ==\n===Celebrimbor in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Shadow of Mordor - Celebrimbor.jpg|Celebrimbor in ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]''\nFile:The Rings of Power (TV series) - Lord Celebrimbor.jpg|Lord Celebrimbor in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Celebrimbor.jpg|Celebrimbor in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n=== Television ===\n'''2022: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'':'''\n:Lord Celebrimbor is portrayed by [[Charles Edwards]] as one of the central characters of the series.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Alice Jones]]|articleurl=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/02/amazon-the-rings-of-power-series-first-look|articlename=Amazon’s Lord of the Rings Series Rises: Inside The Rings of Power\n|dated=10-February-2022|website=[https://www.vanityfair.com VanityFair]|accessed=12-February-2022}}</ref> He first appears in the series' [[A Shadow of the Past|first episode]] at [[Lindon]] and is introduced to [[Elrond]] by [[Gil-galad]].

He is voiced by [[Alister Duncan]]. He is also the main protagonist of the ''Bright Lord'' expansion, where he is revealed to have stolen the One Ring from Sauron at some point in the Second Age, and intended to use it to turn the Dark Lord's own weapons against him. However, he is corrupted by the power of the Ring and doomed to never see the Undying Lands. Though he defeats Sauron in battle, Sauron still managed to reclaim the Ring and banish Celebrimbor's spirit to an eternity as a wraith in the Unseen world. Bound to Talion, Celebrimbor grants him Elven powers to help him seek revenge for the death of his wife and son.\n\n'''2017: ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]]'':'''\n:Celebrimbor uses [[Talion]] to create a new ring of power so they can dominate the orc forces of [[Sauron]]'s army to create one in their own service. With their army amassed they travel Sauron's Road to destroy the Dark Lord. On their way, Talion comes up against the [[Nazgûl]] [[Isildur]] and decides to free Isildur from life as a servant to Sauron. Celebrimbor, angry that Talion vanquished Isildur rather than adding his power to their army, reveals that he intends to replace Sauron instead of destroying him. Talion refuses to help him in his quest for power, so Celebrimbor removes the new ring from him. With their bond lost, Talion begins to bleed profusely and die. Celebrimbor convinces Eltariel, an Elven assassin of [[Galadriel]], to wield the new ring and continue on to defeat Sauron. During their battle, Sauron is able to overpower them and cut Eltariel's fingers off along with the new ring. Sauron then absorbs Celebrimbor and together they become the flaming Eye of Sauron atop [[Barad-dûr]].\n\n'''2022: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Celebrimbor appears in several flashback sequences, depicting his encounter with the \"Lord of Gifts\", the initial idea of creating the Rings of Power and his final doomed stand during the [[Sack of Eregion]].
