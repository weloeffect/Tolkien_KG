Tolkien - The Book of Lost Tales cover.jpg|250px|thumb|Cover of one of the notebooks containing ''The Book of Lost Tales'']]\n'''The Book of Lost Tales''' is the first narrative work of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[Legendarium|mythology]], written and left unfinished between [[1916]] and [[1920]]. It was published posthumously by [[Christopher Tolkien]] as '''''[[The Book of Lost Tales: Part One]]''''' ([[1983]]) and '''''[[The Book of Lost Tales: Part Two]]''''' ([[1984]]). \n\n==Synopsis==\n===Overview===\nIn the Preface of ''Part One'', Christopher Tolkien presents ''The Book of Lost Tales'' mentioning the complicated edition of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and his wish of publishing his father's mythology from its beginning. Although Tolkien wrote these tales in different order and left some of them in a stub stage, his son published them in narrative order, so the book has a similar structure to ''The Silmarillion''. At the end of each chapter, Christopher comments on the different manuscripts and compares the narrative with the published ''Silmarillion'' and ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''. He also includes an analysis of the evolution of the names used in the chapter and poems related with the story.\n\n===Part One===\n[[Eriol]], a mariner, was led to [[Tol Eressëa]], which he walked through for many days till he reached the [[Cottage of Lost Play]], where he was welcomed by its owners [[Vairë (wife of Lindo)|Vairë]] and [[Lindo]]. After dinner, they explained how the isle was the home of [[Elves]], but in ancient times it was visited in dreams by the children of [[Men]] until the path from the [[Great Lands]] was blocked. Then, [[Meril-i-Turinqi]] the queen of Tol Eressëa, allowed Vairë and Lindo to build the Cottage of Lost Play, where the old stories were gathered and sung for the children of the [[Fairies]].\n\nThe following day, Eriol talked with the guard of the door, [[Rúmil (elf of Tirion)|Rúmil]], which told him about the [[Elvish]] [[languages]]. After Eriol asked him about the [[Gods]] or [[Valar]], Rúmil told the tale of \"[[The Music of the Ainur]]\": how [[Ilúvatar]], the Lord beyond the world, created the [[Ainur]], and they sung a [[Music of the Ainur|Great Music]] before him, and from it the world was created. Ilúvatar allowed some of the Ainur to enter the world, so the greatest from them became the Gods therein, and the greatest among them were [[Manwë]], [[Aulë]] and [[Ulmo]]. Eriol asked Rúmil for more details about them, so the guardian told him [[The Coming of the Valar and the Building of Valinor|the next tale]]: the names and relations of the many Valar and their dwellings. How Melko tricked them destroying the [[Two Lamps]], so the Valar had to build [[Valinor]] separated from the Great Lands, and how they created the [[Two Trees]] to give light to their land.\n\nThe following morning, Vairë told Eriol about [[limpë]], a magic drink, which only their queen Meril could grant him. Therefore Eriol left the Cottage of Lost Play and went to Meril's [[korin]], but she explained that he could not be allowed to drink limpë until he had heard all the Elven tales. Thus, she told him \"[[The Chaining of Melko]]\", about how the Valar tricked Melko and put him in chains, followed by \"[[The Coming of the Elves and the Making of Kôr|The Coming of the Elves]]\", about how the Valar summoned to Valinor, and those who accepted were called [[Eldar]]. They were [[Vanyar|Teleri]], [[Noldoli]] and [[Solosimpi]], and were brought to Valinor, where they built [[Eldamar]] and many beautiful things.\n\nBack in the Cottage of Lost Play, Eriol heard from Lindo the three following tales: Melko stole the jewels of the Noldoli and destroyed the Two Trees; and [[Fëanor]] rose in rebellion against the Valar and lead the Noldoli into exile, killing some Solosimpi in the way. Then the Valar created the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]] with the remains of the Two Trees.\n\nVairë proceeded telling the tale of \"[[The Hiding of Valinor]]\", in which the Valar closed their land from the Greater Lands with mountains and magic, although [[Oromë]] created the [[Olórë Mallë]] as a way in. Also, with help of [[Aluin]] and his sons, the Valar ordered the Sun and Moon in a cyclical calendar.\n\nThe next day, [[Gilfanon]], an Elf visiting the Cottage, began the [[Gilfanon's Tale: The Travail of the Noldoli and the Coming of Mankind|following tale]], which was about the sufferings of the Noldoli in exile and about the awakening of [[Men]] in the Great Lands. However, Tolkien left this tale unfinished, although he wrote many and contradictory notes about the first Men and the battles of the Noldoli against Melko.\n\n===Part Two===\nWinter came to Tol Eressëa, so Eriol stayed in the Cottage for many days. One night, he told the children there about his life, and in return [[Vëannë]] told him \"[[The Tale of Tinúviel]]\", about the struggles of [[Beren]] and [[Tinúviel]], two lovers who faced Melko and stole from him one of the Silmarils. Vëannë did not know the ending of the tale, so one of the children explained the happy ending of the two lovers, who came from the dead. \n\nIn the first day of [[Turuhalmë]], [[Eltas]] told a much sadder story: \"[[Turambar and the Foalókë]]\", about [[Túrin]], who suffered the curse of Melko made upon his family, and killed himself soon after slaying the dragon [[Glorund]]. The tale ended with [[Úrin]] bringing the dragon's cursed treasure to [[Artanor]], the kingdom of [[Tinwelint]]. \n\nMany people in the Cottage wished to hear the tale of the [[Necklace of the Dwarves]], but Eltas explained that the tales of the coming of [[Tuor]] and [[Eärendel]] were to be known first. Lindo asked [[Littleheart]] to tell those tales, but these were very long, and it would require seven meetings around the [[Tale-fire]] to hear them all. Thus, a feast was prepared, and Meril and [[Ailios]] were called to help Littleheart in the telling. Three days later, they were all gathered and Littleheart began the tale of \"[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]\": how Tuor was guided by [[Ulmo]] to [[Gondolin]], the last stronghold of the Gnomes, and how there he begot his son Eärendel; and how the city was destroyed by Melko's armies and the pride of king [[Turgon]]. Ailios began the next tale: \"[[The Nauglafring]]\", which continued the story of the gold of Glomund in Artanor, from which Tinwelint only kept the [[Nauglafring]]. Due to this necklace and the Silmaril set in it, the king and his kingdom fell in disgrace, and later his heir [[Dior]] suffered the same doom. Dior's daughter [[Elwing]] ran away and joined the [[exiles of Gondolin]] in the mouth of [[Sirion]]. Now all the tales joined together in the great \"[[The Tale of Eärendel|Tale of Eärendel]]\", which was also the longest.\n\nSadly, Tolkien never ended the following tales, which were not developed beyond outlines and notes, most of them contradictory. But in brief, these were meant to tell the travels of Eärendel till he became a star, the [[War of Wrath|last battles]] in which Melko was defeated, the coming of the Gnomes to Tol Eressëa, how Eriol drank limpë and married, the coming of Men to Tol Eressëa, the battles between Men and Elves, the fading of the Elves, how Tol Eressëa became England and how Eriol wrote the ending of the Tales. At some point, Tolkien also tried to replace the narrative frame of Eriol with [[Ælfwine]] of [[Luthany]], even writing a long narrative about his coming to the Lonely Isle.\n\n===Appendices and Glossaries===\nIn each Part, Christopher includes an Appendix on names, giving the etymology of the [[Elvish]] names as explained in the ''[[Qenya Lexicon]]'', the ''[[Gnomish Lexicon]]'', and other sources related to [[Qenya]] and [[Gnomish]], the first languages of Tolkien's [[Legendarium|mythology]].\n\nAdditionally, each Part also includes a \"Short Glossary of Obsolete, Archaic, and Rare Words\".\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xikzb1ea5_0&t Kipling's Medievalism and Tolkien's Book of Lost Tales], paper by Grace Khuri\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Book of Lost Tales, The}}\n[[Category:The Book of Lost Tales| ]]\n[[de:Das Buch der Verschollenen Geschichten]]\n[[fi:Kadonneitten tarujen kirja]]\n[[fi:The Book of Lost Tales]]"}}}
