The eruption of light from Mordor happens off-screen in the form of an exploding sound and some light reflecting off Frodo, Gollum, Sam (the latter looking at it just before Minas Morgul reply) and nearby rocks; Minas Morgul signal consists of a swirling twister of luminous vapor shooting into the clouds above the central tower.  The scene cuts to Minas Tirith where [[Gandalf]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] witness the Signal.  Frodo, Sam, and Gollum rush back to the base of the stairs and hide behind an outcropping of rock.  Soldiers and citizens of Minas Tirith are shown silently reacting in alarm to the sight. The Lord of the Nazgûl appears on a [[fell beasts|Fell Beast]] and the [[Orcs]] march from the city.\n\n:In [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s text, the Great Signal happens three days ''after'' the lighting of the [[Warning beacons of Gondor]].  In the movie the sequence is reversed; in the morning after the Great Signal Gandalf sends Pippin climbing up to an unlit beacon looming over the City where he ignites it.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Events]]\n[[Category:Third Age]]\n[[fi:Suuri merkki]]"}}}
