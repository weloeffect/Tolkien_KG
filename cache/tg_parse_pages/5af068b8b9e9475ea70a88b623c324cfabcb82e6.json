Where they coalesced into one stream the collected waters flowed just south of [[Wellinghall]], [[Treebeard]]'s home. At its origin the Entwash was a noisy stream that cascaded over rocks and then hurried down the sloped terrain of Fangorn. From there the stream coursed eastward through [[Fangorn Forest|Fangorn]] to the south-east corner of the forest.<ref name=\"Treebeard\">{{TT|III4}}</ref>\n\nUpon leaving the forest the river was still swift-flowing and its banks were deeply carven.<ref name=\"Uruk\">{{TT|III3}}</ref> Leaving the woods, the river flowed past [[the Wold]] of Rohan, and then headed south. As the river passed southward across Rohan its flow became more sluggish and the banks became fens.<ref name=\"Riders\">{{TT|III2}}</ref> At some point it was traversed by the [[Entwade]] ford. At the latitude of [[Edoras]] it was joined by the river [[Snowbourn]] from the west; at their confluence great thickets of willows grew.<ref>{{RK|V3}}</ref>\n\nTurning east, the Entwash flowed towards [[Anduin]], which it joined just south of the [[Rauros|Falls of Rauros]], in the huge inland delta known as the [[Mouths of Entwash]]. The splitting of the river marked the border of Rohan. The [[Mering Stream]] (or ''Glanhír'') met the southernmost of the Entwash's arms there. The delta where the Entwash widened and joined the Anduin was a land of marshes that travelers were advised to avoid.<ref>{{FR|II8}}</ref> The influx of water was so great that across the Anduin the marshes of [[Nindalf]] (Wetwang) arose.<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn {{TA|2510}}, when the Steward [[Cirion]] granted the land of [[Calenardhon]] to [[Eorl]] the Young to be the realm of [[Rohan]], the two leaders (along with the [[Prince of Dol Amroth]] and [[Éomund (Captain of the Éothéod)|Éomund]], the chief captain of the host of the [[Éothéod]]) defined the borders of their respective domains.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref> The border ran along the Mering Stream from the [[Firienholt|Firien Wood]] to the southernmost arm of the Entwash, west up this waterway to the beginning of the delta, and then east along the northernmost arm of the Entwash to the Anduin.<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref>\n\nThe upper part of the Entwash served as another boundary, for it divided Rohan into [[Westemnet]] and [[Eastemnet]]. These were also known as the [[West-mark]] and [[East-mark]] for military purposes.<ref>{{FR|Map}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Breaking of the Fellowship]], [[Orcs]] carried [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] to the point where this river exited [[Fangorn Forest]], followed by [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], and [[Gimli]].\nThe Orcs were stopped just short of Fangorn by riders from Rohan.<ref name=\"Uruk\"/> Merry and Pippin found the opportunity to escape and they followed the river into the woods, and taken by [[Treebeard]] the Ent west along the stream to his home.<ref name=\"Treebeard\"/> In the meantime the [[Three Hunters]] followed the tracks along the river and into the forest, where they met [[Gandalf]] the White.<ref>{{TT|III5}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Éomer]] became [[Kings of Rohan|King of Rohan]] he discarded the old offices of [[Second Marshal of the Riddermark|Second]] and [[Third Marshal of the Riddermark|Third Marshals of Rohan]] and instead created the positions of [[Marshal of the West-mark]] (the first of whom was [[Erkenbrand]]) and [[Marshal of the East-mark]] (the first of whom was [[Elfhelm]]).<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nEntwash was a translation of the [[Sindarin]] name '''''Onodló''''', named for the [[Ents]] (''[[Onodrim]]'') of Fangorn Forest,<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, note 46</ref> but the origin of the name was largely forgotten by the [[Rohirrim]]. ''Onodló'' comes from ''[[Onod]]'' (\"Ent\")<ref>{{UT|15}}, entry \"Enyd\"</ref> + ''[[ló]]'' (\"stream\").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-970299561.html|articlename=S. ''Onodló'' loc.|website=[http://eldamo.org/index.html Eldamo - An Elvish Lexicon]|accessed=2 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nEntwash is a modernization of [[Old English]] '''''Entwaesc''''' (''waesc'' \"flood water\"), so modernised because it was recognisable by speakers of [[Westron]]. [[Gondorians]] used that name, assimilated to their own language.<ref>{{HM|N}}, pp. 769-70</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2012: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Entwash.jpg|thumb|250px|Entwash in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n:The Entwash is a major landmark in Rohan and serves as the boundary between the in-game regions of East and West Rohan. The 2012 ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Riders of Rohan|Riders of Rohan]]'' expansion only included the [[Eastemnet]], so the Entwash was completely impassable. The 2013 ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Helm's Deep|Helm's Deep]]'' expansion completed the rest of Rohan and added several crossings to the Entwash, as well as allowing the players to simply swim across. After leaving the [[Fangorn Forest]], the river flows through the lush \"Entwash Vale\" (the in-game region of [[the Wold]] being more narrowly defined as laying near [[Anduin]] as opposed to the entire north of Rohan) and slows down to allow for crossing between the towns of Eaworth and Oserley. It then passes towns of Garsfeld and [[Entwade]], which guards the ford of the same name. The large town of [[Snowbourn]] stands where the river of the same name joins Entwash, which continues to flow east through the marshland area, passing the town of Fenmarch before leaving the borders of Rohan and flowing into [[Anórien]] where it forms the [[Mouths of Entwash]].\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Rivers of Rohan]]\n[[de:Onodló]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/eaux/rohan/onodlo]]\n[[fi:Onodló]]"}}}
