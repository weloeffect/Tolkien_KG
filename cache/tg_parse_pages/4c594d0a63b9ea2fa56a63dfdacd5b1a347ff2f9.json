Upon their return, the Elven ambassadors convinced many to join them on the [[Great Journey]] to the West.  During the thousand mile journey, the Elven host separated into three groups, the [[Vanyar]], the [[Noldor]], and the Teleri.<ref name=\"capt\">{{S|Captivity}}</ref>\n\nThe Teleri were the largest folk and they were divided in two hosts, led by Elwë and his brother Olwë. Elwë was more eager than his brother to see again Valinor, and wished to catch up with the Noldor because of his friendship with Finwë; but the Teleri were also the slowest and were the last to reach the western shores of Middle-earth.<ref name=\"capt\" />\n[[File:Elena Kukanova - Nan Elmoth - Elwe and Melian.jpg|thumb|left|''Nan Elmoth - Elwe and Melian'' by [[Elena Kukanova]]]]\nAfter many years the Teleri crossed the [[Blue Mountains]] and stayed for some time in [[East Beleriand]].<ref name=\"capt\" /> During this time Elwë returned from a meeting with his friend Finwë, and wandered into the [[Nan Elmoth|Forest of Nan Elmoth]], where he met and fell in love with [[Melian]] the [[Maiar|Maia]]. Caught in an enchantment of their own making, Elwë and Melian could not be found by the searching Teleri. When the Valar returned to take the remaining Elves to Valinor, only some of them followed Olwë across the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]]. The rest had come to love the lands of [[Beleriand]] and refused to leave without their missing lord.<ref>{{S|Thingol}}</ref>\n\n===King of Doriath===\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Elwë heraldic device.jpg|100px|thumb|right|Elwë's device with the Winged Moon by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]\nIn {{YT|1152}}, Elwë awoke from his trance and reappeared with his bride Melian.<ref>{{AA|74}}</ref> He was much changed since his people last they saw him: while he had been fair and noble before, he now stood like a Maia above them as the tallest of the Children of Ilúvatar. He gathered his people together and founded the Kingdom of [[Doriath]]. His subjects would become the Sindar, or the \"Grey Elves\", and their language was [[Sindarin]]. From then on Elwë was known as King Elu Thingol, and he claimed lordship over all the lands in [[Beleriand]]. While Thingol was king of the Grey Elves, he saw the light of the [[Two Trees]] as an ambassador of the Valar and thus he was counted as a [[High Elves|High Elf]], and equal to any lord of the Eldar.<ref name=\"Princes\" /><ref name=\"Thingol\">{{S|Sindar}}</ref> He was even acknowledged as high-king of all the Teleri in Beleriand, even after Doriath became hidden.<ref name=\"PM\" />\n\nOn Melian's advice, Thingol became an ally of the [[Dwarves]] of [[Belegost]], who carved the caverns of [[Menegroth]] for him. In payment he gave them, along with many other things, the great pearl [[Nimphelos]].<ref name=\"Thingol\" />\n\nA thousand years before the first rising of the Sun and the Moon the [[Green-elves]] entered Beleriand under [[Denethor of the Nandor|Denethor]]. Thingol welcomed them and gave them the lands of [[Ossiriand]], which they named [[Lindon]]. The Green Elves told of the spread of the [[Orcs]] and other foul creatures in the north and east of Middle-earth. The Grey Elves began arming themselves.<ref name=\"Thingol\" />\n\nCenturies later [[Melkor]] returned to Middle-earth. Now named Morgoth, he had destroyed the Two Trees, killed Finwë, the King of the Noldor, and stolen the fabled [[Silmarils]]. Seeking to claim dominion quickly, he launched a sudden assault on the lands of the Sindar. The [[First Battle of Beleriand]] went well for Thingol, who prevented any Orcs from invading Doriath, but the Green Elves took horrific losses and the [[Falathrim]] were besieged.<ref name=\"Thingol\" />\n\nThe Falathrim were finally saved by the unexpected arrival of the Noldor, who launched the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]] (\"Battle Under the Stars\") in which Morgoth's forces were all but annihilated.<ref name=\"Return\">{{S|Return}}</ref>\n\n===Thingol and the Noldor===\n[[File:Elena Kukanova - King of Doriath.jpg|thumb|left|''King of Doriath'' by [[Elena Kukanova]]]]\nAfter the First Battle of Beleriand, Doriath was encircled by the [[Girdle of Melian]], an impenetrable fence of enchantment that guarded the kingdom.<ref name=\"Thingol\" /> While his own kingdom was protected, Thingol was still loath to surrender any other lands in Beleriand to the Noldor as he was suspicious of the aggressive new lords in Middle-earth.<ref name=\"Return\" />\n{{blockquote|In [[Hithlum]] the Noldor have leave to dwell, and in the highlands of [[Dorthonion]], and in the lands east of Doriath that are empty and wild... for I am the Lord of Beleriand, and all who seek to dwell there shall hear my word.|''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', \"[[Of the Return of the Noldor]]\"}}\n\nKing Thingol's relations with the Noldor were strained, and grew worse decades later when he learned the truth of the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë]]. Thingol banned the use of [[Quenya]] in his lands, which led to Sindarin being the common Elven tongue in Middle-earth. The King of Doriath refused to aid the Noldor in the war against Morgoth, and took little part in the ongoing struggle.<ref>{{S|Noldor}}</ref>\n\n===Quest for the Silmaril===\n[[File:Felix Sotomayor - Beren at Thingol's Court.jpg|thumb|''Beren at Thingol's Court'' by [[Felix Sotomayor]]]]\n{{Quote|If thou fearest neither spell, wall nor weapons, as thou saist, then go fetch me a Silmaril from the crown of Morgoth. Then we will give jewel for jewel, but thou shalt win the fairer: Lúthien of the First-born and of the Gods.|Thingol, ''[[The War of the Jewels]]'', \"The Gray Annals\"}}\nThingol and Melian had one child, a daughter named [[Lúthien]], said to be the fairest woman ever to live. Lúthien fell in love with a [[Men|Man]] named [[Beren]]. Thingol did not wish for the two to wed, as he valued his daughter very highly and disliked Men. As a bride-price he asked for a Silmaril from the crown of [[Morgoth]], thinking there was no way that Beren could fulfill this demand.<ref name=\"Beren\">{{S|Beren}}</ref>\n\nHowever, when Beren and Lúthien came back from [[Angband]], and when Beren showed him his missing hand which still held the Silmaril in the belly of [[Carcharoth]], he softened his heart towards him. Soon, though, Carcharoth in his anguish and rage from the Silmaril that burned his insides, broke through the Girdle of Melian and entered Doriath. In that hour, Thingol, along with Beren, [[Mablung]], [[Beleg]], and [[Huan]] the Hound of Valinor, began the [[Hunting of the Wolf]]. Carcharoth was finally slain by Huan, but both Huan and Beren died in the process. After that, Lúthien died also, and coming to the [[Halls of Mandos]] she begged [[Mandos]] that Beren be returned to life. However, it was beyond the power of Mandos to withhold the souls of Men from going beyond the [[Circles of the World]].<ref name=\"Beren\" />\n\nTherefore, [[Ilúvatar]], through [[Manwë]], offered Lúthien and Beren the opportunity to live again, but with Lúthien sharing the [[Gift of Men]]. She agreed, and they both came back to life and lived out the remainder of their second lives at [[Tol Galen]], far from the sight of any other mortals.<ref name=\"Beren\" />\n\n===Fostering of Túrin===\nThingol adopted as a son a young Man named [[Túrin]], son of [[Húrin]] and akin to Beren himself, who was sent to Doriath when he was seven years old.<ref>{{CH|4}}</ref> When he grew up, he was permitted to join Beleg Cúthalion on the marches of Doriath, fighting the Orcs of Morgoth.<ref name=\"Turin\">{{S|Turin}}</ref><ref>{{CH|5}}</ref>\n\nTúrin accidentally caused the death of [[Saeros]], one of Thingol's counselors who had provoked and attacked him. Before he could be either punished or forgiven he fled.

In anger, he threw the [[Nauglamír]], the treasure of [[Nargothrond]], before King Thingol, bitterly \"thanking\" him for aiding his son. Melian pierced through Húrin's madness and grief; shamed by his actions, he offered the Nauglamír to Thingol sincerely and left Menegroth a broken man.<ref name=\"Doriath\">{{S|Doriath}}</ref>\n\nAt that time, a desire came into Thingol's heart to take the Nauglamír and place the Silmaril into it, thus melding together two of the greatest creations made by the Elves and the Dwarves. He hired skilled [[Dwarves of Nogrod|Dwarven craftsmen]], but they secretly desired to possess both treasures for themselves. After their work was completed, the Dwarves refused to give the Nauglamír to Thingol, claiming that he had no right to own the priceless necklace made by their ancestors. Realizing that they were coveting the Silmaril, Thingol became infuriated and insulted them. The Dwarves were angered by his harsh words and killed him. This led to the [[battle in the Thousand Caves|sacking of Menegroth]] and the eventual [[Second Kinslaying|destruction of Doriath]], which scattered its people.<ref name=\"Doriath\" />\n\n==Characteristics==\nHis hair was grey as silver, his eyes were as stars, and he was the tallest of all the Elven-folk.<ref>{{MR|P3I3}}</ref>{{rp|§27}} which means that he was taller than Elendil, probably the tallest man, who was 7'11\" or 2.41 m tall.<ref name=\"linear\">{{UT|Linear}}, note concerning the different routes from Osgiliath to Imladris, first paragraph</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Elwe Singollo.mp3|Ardamir}}\n'''Thingol''' was his [[epessë|anessë]] (given name) in [[Sindarin]], which means \"Greycloak\"<ref>{{MR|P3II3a}}, p. 217</ref> or Greymantle.<ref name=\"Thingol\">{{S|Sindar}}</ref> The first element of the name is ''thin(d)'' (\"grey\").<ref>{{S|Elements}}, entry ''thin(d)''</ref><ref>{{PE|17}}, entry Q '''sinda''', p. 72</ref> Paul Strack suggests that the second element ''gol'' is the [[lenition|lenited]] form of ''coll'' (\"cloak\", \"mantle\").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-3589954001.html|articlename=S.
