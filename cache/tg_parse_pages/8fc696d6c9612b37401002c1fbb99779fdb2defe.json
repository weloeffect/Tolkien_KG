He was one of the few survivors of the [[Battle of Cirith Ungol]]<ref name=\"Tower\">{{RK|VI1}}</ref> on [[14 March]] {{TA|3019}}.<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>\n\nSnaga was running down the stairs of the tower when he encountered what he thought was a \"[[Samwise Gamgee|Great Elf-warrior]]\" on the stairs.  Spinning around, he fled back the way he came.  The \"Great Elf-warrior\" was actually [[Samwise Gamgee]] who followed the Orc, although being tired he fell behind his foe.\n\nSnaga came upon [[Shagrat]], who ordered him to send word to [[Sauron]] that they captured a [[Frodo Baggins|Halfling]]. Snaga refused, and after a short chase, made his way to the top of the tower. There, he lashed the prisoner, [[Frodo Baggins]], with a whip. He was quickly overcome by [[Samwise Gamgee]], and fell through the trap door to his death.<ref name=\"Tower\"/>\n\n== Etymology ==\nSnaga was a contemptuous term for the lesser [[Orcs]] of [[Mordor]] and [[Isengard]], used especially among the larger and stronger [[Uruk-hai]]. It comes from a word in the [[Black Speech]] meaning 'slave' or 'servant'.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 79</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''1980: [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]:'''\n:Two Orcs appear in the role of Snaga, though none are called or credited as such. Sam encounters one on the stairs, who runs, trips and falls to his doom. A second orc is lashing Frodo. After a short fight, he too falls to his doom.\n\n'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:''' \n:Snaga was voiced by [[Gordon Reid]].\n\n'''[[1989]]: [[Crack of Doom Software Adventure|''Crack of Doom'' Software Adventure''']]\n:Snaga is simply referred to in-game as a \"small rat-faced Orc\", and is armed with a short knife. Like in the book, he will flee upon first seeing Sam, leading the player on a short chase through the tower until he reaches the \"[[Shagrat|large angry Orc]]\". He can be killed by Sam.\n\n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'''''\n:Like in the animated film, Snaga's role is seemingly filled by more than one Orc. First, Sam encounters a trio of Uruk-hai on the stairs, before slaying all three of them. Later, [[Gorbag]] (who survives the battle in this adaptation) fulfills the latter role as the Orc that threatens Frodo before being killed by Sam.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Snaga (orc of Isengard)]], another Orc called Snaga\n\n{{references}}\n{{title}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:Orcs]]\n[[Category:Servants of Sauron]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[de:Snaga#Bekannte Snagas]]\n[[fi:Snaga (Cirith Ungol)]]"}}}
