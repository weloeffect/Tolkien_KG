They formed in 1992 when multi-instrumentalists Steve Babb and Fred Schendel began to write and record ''[[Journey of the Dunadan]]'', a concept album based on the story of [[Aragorn]] from [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n\nWhile many musicians have appeared on Glass Hammer albums over the years, Babb and Schendel have remained the core of the band.  Both men play a variety of instruments, but Babb mainly concentrates on bass guitar and keyboards while Schendel also plays keyboards as well as various guitars and drums (until the addition of live drummer Matt Mendians to the studio recording band in 2004).  They also sing, although a number of other vocalists (most notably Michelle Young, Walter Moore and Susie Bogdanowicz) have also handled lead vocal duties.\nLyrically, Glass Hammer is inspired mostly by their love of fantasy literature (most notably Tolkien and C. S. Lewis) and by their [[Christianity|Christian faith]].\n\n==Current formation==\n* Fred Schendel – keyboards, guitars, vocals\n* Steve Babb – keyboards, bass guitar, vocals\n* Carl Groves – lead vocals\n* David Wallimann – guitar\n* Susie Bogdanowicz – lead vocals\n* Matt Mendians – drums\n* The Adonia String Trio – string trio\n** Rebecca James – violin\n** Susan Whitacre – viola\n** Rachel Hackenberger – cello\n==Tolkien-related discography==\n*[[Journey of the Dunadan]] (1993) - Progressive \"Rock Opera\" based around the story of [[The Lord of the Rings]]\n*[[The Middle Earth Album]] (2001) — A mostly-acoustic album, \"recorded live at the Prancing Pony in Bree,\" which expanded on the medieval fantasy-inspired acoustic folk song style found on several songs on Journey of the Dunadan\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.glasshammer.com Official Website]\n[[Category:Bands]]\n[[Category:Rock music]]"}}}
