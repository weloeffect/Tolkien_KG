As Morgoth intended, the destruction of the majority of the Noldor peoples was nearly complete, though a handful of survivors managed to escape. The battle was well detailed in [[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]], and long remembered by the elves.\n\n==History==\n===Prelude===\nGondolin had long been a hidden city, heavily fortified and cut off from the Noldor's allies and enemies alike. The Elf [[Maeglin]], a lord of Gondolin, resented both [[Turgon]] and [[Tuor]], primarily because of the latter's marriage to [[Idril]], whom he desired as a lover. Once, he was far away from Gondolin, searching for ore in the mountains. Orcs captured him, and he pleaded with and bribed them to bring him to Morgoth rather than kill or torture him. Morgoth recognized Maeglin, and told him he would make him ruler of Gondolin and husband of Idril if he betrayed the Noldor and gave Morgoth information on how to gain access to the city. Maeglin agreed to the treachery, and was given a token by Morgoth that would supposedly protect his life during the assault. Maeglin returned to the city and spoke nothing of his capture. However, Idril foreshadowed the dangers to come, so she began working on a hidden [[Idril's secret way|passageway]] deep beneath Gondolin that would later act as an escape route.\n\n===Battle===\nOn [[Midsummer]] of {{FA|510}},<ref>{{WJ|Years}}, p. 351</ref> the [[Gondolindrim]] were celebrating the festival of the [[Gates of Summer]]. As they gathered in the night to observe the sunrise over the mountains, a light was seen in the North instead of the East: the armies of Morgoth were coming and nothing could stop them until they reached the walls of the city. [[Balrogs]], [[Orcs]], [[wolves]] and [[dragons]] surrounded the city, and a siege began.\n\n{{blockquote|Of the deeds of desperate valour there done, by the chieftains of the [[Twelve houses of the Gondothlim|noble houses]] and their warriors, and not least by Tuor, is much told in ''[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]''; of the death of [[Rog]] without the walls; and of the battle of [[Ecthelion|Ecthelion of the Fountain]] with [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog lord of Balrogs]] in the very [[Square of the King]], where each slew the other; and of the defence of the [[Tower of the King|Tower of Turgon]] by the men of his house-hold, until the tower was overthrown; and mighty was its fall and the fall of Turgon in its ruin.|''[[Quenta Noldorinwa]]'', QII §16}}\n\nDuring the havoc of the battle, Maeglin went to Tuor's home on the southern wall and attempted to assassinate [[Eärendil]], but was caught by Tuor before he could do so. There Maeglin was struck down and fell from the wall to his death below, fulfilling the curse of his father [[Eöl]]. Then Tuor and Idril gathered as much Gondolindrim they could and led them to the secret way. The [[Exiles of Gondolin]] could cross [[Tumladen]] not being noticed, as the fountains and burnings of the city had covered the plain with fume and mists.\n\n[[File:Steamey - Glorfindel and the Balrog.jpg|thumb|right|''Glorfindel and the Balrog'' by [[:Category:Images by Steamey|Steamey]]]]\n\nAlthough Morgoth was ignorant of their escape, the survivors found an ambush of Orcs while crossing the [[Cirith Thoronath]], and a Balrog was with them. The [[Eagles]] protected the refugees against the Orcs, but [[Glorfindel]] fought the Balrog alone. He slew the beast but was slain in turn, and both fell off the mountain pass into the abyss.\n\n===Aftermath===\nThough Morgoth's marshal Gothmog had fallen in the battle, he had conquered the greatest and last city of the Noldor and had almost entirely wiped out their people. In the north, Morgoth's victory was complete. However, this would later be his doom, for years after the siege, Eärendil, a survivor, sailed to Valinor where he requested their aid in defeating Morgoth. This would lead to the [[War of Wrath]], after which Morgoth was cast into the [[Void]].\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n{{Main|The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)#The battle of Gondolin}}\n[[Tolkien]] wrote two narrative versions of the Fall, one in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' and other within the ''[[Quenta Noldorinwa]]'' (published in ''[[The Shaping of Middle-earth]]''). \"[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]\" was the first tale he ever wrote of the [[legendarium]] and is very detailed, that even the ''Quenta Noldorinwa''<ref>{{SM|Q16II}}, p. 144</ref> and ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' mention it as a reference. Although the ''Quenta Noldorinwa'' was a more of a summary, it was the text used by [[Christopher Tolkien]] for the published ''Silmarillion'', as it was more developed in Tolkien's thinking.<ref>{{LT2|IIIn}}, p. 212</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*''[[The Fall of Gondolin]]''\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Conflicts in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Conflicts of the First Age]]\n[[Category:Gondolin]]\n[[Category:Sieges]]"}}}
