But I cannot guess what it means, save that it is laden with the sadness of Mortal Men.|[[Legolas]]<ref>{{TT|King}}</ref>}}\nThe Rohan language is derived from the language of the [[Éothéod]], who were among the [[Northmen]] and was related to other Northmen languages, such as those of  [[Rhovanion]], [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]], and [[Dale]]. \n\nThe [[Hobbits]] before their [[Wandering Days]] in the [[Vales of Anduin]] had contact with that people and their languages had many words in common. For example the Rohirrim had retained the legend of the being known as ''[[kûd-dûkan]]'' (translated as ''hol-bytla''), a term which became ''[[kuduk]]'' by the Hobbits, the name they had for themselves.\n\nMany archaic [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] names bear similarities to Rohan's, since the ancestors of [[The Shire]] hobbits lived on the upper reaches of the [[Anduin]], close to the ancestors of the Rohirrim, and there was apparently a good deal of linguistic cross-fertilisation.\n\nDespite its relation to [[Westron]], the Rohan language was not intelligible to its speakers. [[Legolas]] was unable to understand the songs, however he noted that the language is like the land itself: rich and rolling in part, and else hard and stern as the mountains.\n\n==Structure==\nRohan names often have the element ''lô-/loh-'', which means \"horse\". ''[[Lōgrad]]'' means \"Rohan\" or \"[[Riddermark|Horse-mark]]\"; ''[[Lohtûr]]'' means \"[[Éothéod|Horse-people]]\".\n\nThe latter shows the element ''[[tûr]]'' also seen in the name ''[[Tûrac]]'' \"[[Théoden|People-king]]\".\n\n==Name==\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] consistently, with only one exception, used the name '''Rohan''' for the name of the language of the Rohirrim in his notes on the [[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings|Nomenclature of The Lord of the Rings]] that he made to assist translators in translating the book into other languages, which he had almost completed on 2 January 1967.<ref>{{HM|N}}, \"''Abbreviations'' R. = ''Rohan:'' the language used in Rohan\", p. 752; \"Dunlendings.

Tolkien also used the name ''Rohan'' for the name of the language of the Rohirrim in a manuscript for an earlier draft version of Appendix F of The Lord of the Rings.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, manuscript F2 The Languages at the end of the Third Age, $48. \"Hobbit. [...] The primitive form represented by Rohan cugbagu\"; $49. \"Personal names. corresponded closely in meaning to Rohan maur\"; $54 \"corresponding to Rohan turac-\"; $56 \"relation of Rohan cugbagu [...] relation to Rohan (that is Old English) mathum [...] compared with Rohan castu\"; \"Rohan smygel [...] genuine Rohan trahan\"</ref> Also [[Christopher Tolkien]], in one instance, refers to the language of Rohan as \"Rohan\".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 153</ref>\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien used the adjective '''Rohanese''' once in an [[The Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor|essay about the names of rivers]], which he wrote after 23 June 1969<ref>{{VT|42a}}, \"Adorn [...] any name in the region not of Rohanese origin\", p. 8</ref> but it is not clear by the context if the word is the name of a language, or simply an adjective. He used the word Rohanese twice, in the essay about the Eldarin bases related to light and darkness, which was written on Allen & Unwin scrap paper dating from the late 1960s.<ref>{{NM|P3i}}, \"''Limlight'', modernized from Rohanese ''Limliht''\", p. 284 and note 9 \"[?Older] Rohanese had a voiceless initial ''lh''\"</ref> and once in his Nomenclature of The Lord of the Rings.<ref>{{HM|N}}, Greyhame. [...] Modernized 'Rohanese', p. 762</ref>\n\n[[Robert Foster]] in ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'' uses the name '''Rohirric''', which has stuck among the students of Tolkien's languages. Perhaps it was modelled on \"Rohirrim\" and the ending ''-ic'' of \"Adûnaic\". [[Christopher Gilson]] uses \"Rohirric\" in the List of Abbreviations to \"[[Parma Eldalamberon 17|Words, Phrases & Passages in ''The Lord of the Rings'']]\",<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 8 and p. 220</ref> as well as [[Helge Fauskanger]] in [[Ardalambion]].<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/mannish.htm|articlename=Various Mannish Tongues - the sadness of Mortal Men?|dated=|website=Arda|accessed=10 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Lisa Star]] in [[Tyalië Tyelelliéva 17]] claimed that she saw the name '''Rohirian''' written in a small note at the bottom of a draft of [[The Lord of the Rings]] appendix on languages in [[Marquette University]].<ref>[[Lisa Star]] (ed.), [[Tyalië Tyelelliéva 17]], \"Languages of Rohan and Dale by Lisa Star\"</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\n{{main|Old English}}\nTolkien turned names in the Rohan language into modernized Old English names.<ref>{{L|144}}, \"Since the ''Rohirrim'' [...], I have turned their names into forms like (but not identical with) Old English\"</ref> Even modernized names show a strong Anglo-Saxon influence. Old English was supposed to render an archaic form of [[Westron]], which was supposedly rendered by Modern English. This solution occurred to Tolkien in 1942, when he was searching for an explanation of the Eddaic name of the dwarves already published in ''[[The Hobbit]]''.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, manuscript F2 The Languages at the end of the Third Age, Commentary §58</ref>\n\nSome words show the plural ending \"-as\", as were Old English nouns of the strong-masculine declension.\n\nThe Rohirrim used the Germanic patronymic \"-ing\".  They called themselves the '''[[Eorlingas]]''', and [[Beorn]]'s people were the '''[[Beornings]]''', Scyld's people were the Scyldingas in Norse and Anglo-Saxon mythology.\n\n[[Théoden]] was referred to as \"Théoden King\", rather than \"King Théoden\", just as Scandinavian and Anglo-Saxon kings had the word \"konungr\"/\"cyning\" (\"king\") added after their names, e.g. ''Hervarðar konungr'', rather than before.\n\nSome Old English names that render Rohirric words include:\n\n* '''[[Éothéod]]:''' from \"eoh\" (\"war-horse\") and \"þeod\" (\"folk\", \"people\", \"nation\")\n* '''[[Gríma]]:''' possibly from \"grima\" (\"mask\", \"helmet\", \"ghost\")\n* '''[[Eorl]]:''' from \"eorl\" (\"nobleman\")\n* '''[[Théodred]]:''' from \"þeod\" (\"folk\", \"people\", \"nation\") and \"ræd\" (\"counsel\")\n*'''[[Elfwine]]:''' from [[Ælfwine]] (\"[[Elf-friend]]\")\n\n===Translation===\nAs [[Westron]] is rendered in the novels with English, Rohan language is always translated through [[Old English]]. This is because [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] tried to reproduce for English readers its archaic flavour in relationship to the Common Speech. Westron is an amalgamated language which, although deriving from [[Adûnaic]], was formed from the languages of the [[Middle Men]], much like the English language with many influences from [[Celtic]] and [[Wikipedia:Norman language|Norman]].<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English_creole_hypothesis|articlename=Middle English creole hypothesis|dated=29 October 2012|website=[http://en.wikipedia.org/ Wikipedia]|accessed=10 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the relationship between the two pairs of languages is not identical: Old English is the direct ancestor of modern English, but Rohan was not the direct ancestor of Westron, since the latter derives from [[Adûnaic]].\n\nIn some cases, Tolkien did not provide genuine Old English words, but rather modernizations. Such names are:\n*[[Éothain]] instead of ''eohþeg(e)n''<ref>{{HM|RC}}, \"(modernized) ''þeg(e)n''\", p. 369</ref>\n*Firien instead of ''Firgen'' in the names [[Halifirien]], [[Firienfeld]] and [[Firienholt]]<ref>{{HM|N}}, entry '''Firien''', \"has been altered to\", p. 770</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, \"Halifirien (modernized in spelling for ''Haligfirgen''\", p. 511</ref><ref>{{UT|8e}}, \"modernized spelling for\", note 33, p. 314</ref>\n*[[Elfwine]] instead of ''Ælfwine''<ref>{{HM|N}}, entry '''Elf-friend''', p. 756</ref>\n*[[Gamling]] instead of ''Gameling''<ref>{{HM|N}}, entry '''Gamling (the Old)''', \"slightly anglicized and modernized\", p. 758</ref>\n*[[Greyhame]] instead of ''greg-hama''<ref>{{HM|RC}}, entry '''Greyhame''', \"Modernized 'Rohanese'\", p. 758</ref>\n*[[Gríma|Wormtongue]] instead of ''wyrm-tunge''<ref>{{HM|RC}}, entry '''Wormtongue''', \"'Modernized' form of \", p. 764</ref>\n*[[Woses]] instead of ''wasan''; also isolated from the English term ''Woodwoses''.<ref>{{HM|N}}, entry '''Woses''', \"(modernized) the Rohan word for\", p. 764</ref>\n*[[Dunharrow]] instead of ''Dunhaerg''<ref>{{HM|N}}, entry '''Dunharrow''', \"modernization of\", p. 769</ref>\n*[[Entwade]], [[Entwash]], [[Entwood]] instead of ''Entwaed, Entwaesc, Entwudu''<ref name=Entwade>{{HM|N}}, entry '''Entwade, Entwash, Entwood''', \"'modernized' names in Rohan language\", p. 769</ref>\n*[[Edoras]] and  instead of ''Eodoras<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 247</ref>\n*[[Snowbourn]] instead of ''snawburna''<ref>{{HM|N}}}, entry '''Snowbourn''', \"Modernized [form of] the actual Rohan (i.e. OE)\", p. 776</ref>\n*[[Stoningland]] instead of ''Staning-(land)''<ref>{{HM|N}}}, entry '''Stoningland''', \"this has been 'modernized'\", p. 776</ref> \n*[[Upbourn]] instead of ''Upburnan''<ref>{{HM|N}}, entry '''Upbourn''', \"in modernized E. form\", p. 778</ref>\n\nThe reason for the use of modernized forms of those names by speakers of [[Westron]] was that they were said to be intelligible for them; [[Gondorians]] were familiar with the place-names of Rohan (like ''Entwade''),<ref name=Entwade/> while Hobbits recognized some common elements with [[Hobbitish|their dialect]].<ref>{{App|Translation}}, p. 1136</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n{{languages}}\n[[Category:Rohanese| ]]\n[[de:Sprache der Rohirrim]]\n[[fr:encyclo/langues/rohanais]]\n[[fi:Rohirrimin kieli]]"}}}
