And they skin the body off you as soon as look at you, and leave you all cold in the dark on the other side.|[[Gorbag]]<ref>{{TT|IV10}}</ref>}}\n\nThe '''wraith-world''' was a mysterious alternative aspect of reality that belonged to the realm of the Unseen. Some of the most obvious examples of Unseen creatures were the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]], which were invisible and formless without the guises provided by [[Sauron]].<ref name=\"Meet\">{{FR|Meetings}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Rings of Power]] were one of the means that could partly draw one into the wraith-world. The [[Men]] who became the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]], seem to have led a dual existence on the boundary between two worlds: our own, [[Seen]] world, and the wraith-world. After centuries, they ended up fading, and while they had a partial form in our reality, they had a more solid existence in the Unseen. \n\nTheir [[Morgul-knife|blades]] seem to have been used to terrorize their servants, as Gorbag attested to, and if the broken shard of one such blade had reached Frodo's heart, he would have been transformed into not only an Unseen existence, but into the wraith servant of a Nazgûl.<ref name=\"Meet\"/> \n\n==Inspiration==\nThough [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] goes into very little detail about this 'other side' to reality, it is mentioned often in accounts that have come down to our own time through folklore. In these stories, it is commonplace to find fairies and elves - and less friendly beings - moving between our world and their own mysterious realm as a [[Wikipedia:Parallel dimension|parallel dimension]]. Indeed, these stories are, in part, the origin of the idea of 'fairyland', and it seems plausible that Tolkien's idea of the ghostly wraith-world is in some way related to them. In the end, though, he gives us so little information that it is hard to do more than speculate the subject.\n\nHe did write that his characters, the Elves of Midde-earth, were not like the elves commonly found in fairy tales: \"the Elves shed all associations and qualities that would be now commonly considered ‘fairylike’, and those who remained in the Great Lands in Ages of the world at this time unconceived were to grow greatly in stature and in power: there was nothing filmy or transparent about the heroic or majestic Eldar of the Third Age of Middle-earth.\"<ref>{{LT2|VI}} p. 327</ref>\n\nHowever, in his descriptions of the Elves, those who remained in Middle-earth, would in time, be consumed by their own spirit, \"ere Arda ends all the Eldalië on earth will become as spirits invisible to mortal eyes, unless they will to be seen by some among Men into whose mind they may enter directly.<ref>{{MR|Laws}} p. 212</ref> \n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':''' \n[[Image:Peter Jackson's Arwen.jpg|thumb|Arwen as seen by Frodo]]\n:The scenes where Frodo wears the Ring, show a different, dark and ghastly version of reality, indicating that Frodo is shifted to the wraith world, although no explanation is given in dialogue. The effects of the Ring become more clear in the Weathertop scene where he sees the Ringwraiths in clear form while wearing the Ring. Two times when he puts the Ring on, once in Bree and later at [[Amon Hen]], he is percieved by the Eye of [[Sauron]].\n\n:In the book, Frodo under the effect of the Morgul blade sees the luminous form of Glorfindel, but since in the movie he is replaced by [[Arwen]], Frodo is supposed to see the Unseen version of Arwen; while in the Seen realm she wore a traveler's uniform, Frodo saw her in a white dress  bathed in an aura of light. \n\n'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring (video game) - Unseen Witch-king.JPG|250px|thumb|right|The [[Witch-king]]'s true form in [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]]]\n:When wearing the ring, the edges of the screen become engulfed in flames in the shape of an Eye. The player, as Frodo, can only stay Unseen for a limited amount of time, before his \"purity bar\" is emptied. Only Ringwraiths can see the Unseen; other enemies such as [[wolves]] and [[Orcs]] cannot.\n\n'''2003: [[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|''The Hobbit'' (2003 video game)]]:'''\n:Much like the original book, the Unseen world merely serves as a plot device in the halls of [[Thranduil|the Elvenking]]. The screen becomes filled with a haze, but many creatures can still see Bilbo. Only the Elves and Men cannot.\n\n'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''\n:When the Ring slips onto Bilbo's hand as he is escaping [[Gollum]], the Unseen World appears to be a pale, slowed-down, somewhat calmer version of the world around him. This could reflect the fact that Sauron is still in hiding and not yet searching for The Ring.\n\n'''2014: ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]'':'''\n: The protagonist of the game, Talion, possesses the ability to see into the wraith-world due to being resurrected by a wraith. In the game, this allows the player to see through walls and spot various things that are otherwise invisible. Its sequel, \"[[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]]\", expand the concept with the presence of the Nazgûl, which have greater powers like instant travel or magic in the wraith-world.\n\n'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''\n:As Bilbo wears the Ring in [[Dale]] to run for the [[Raven Hill]], dark shadows (Orcs) and white auras (Elves) are seen fighting around him.\n\n'''2022: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'':'''\n:'''30 September: ''[[Udûn (episode)|Udûn]]'':'''\n::During [[Galadriel|Galadriel's]] interrogation of [[Adar (The Rings of Power)|Adar]], the captive [[Moriondor]] mentions that [[Sauron]] was trying to craft something capable of acting on both the Seen and the Unseen worlds: a power over the flesh rather than a power of the flesh.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Light of Valinor]]\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Concepts]]\n[[Category:Cosmology]]\n[[Category:Nazgûl]]\n[[Category:Spirits]]\n[[Category:Undead]]"}}}
