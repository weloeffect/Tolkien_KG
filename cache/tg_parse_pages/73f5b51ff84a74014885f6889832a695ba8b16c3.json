It is the basis of [[Appendix A]] in the published ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.\n\nThe chapter begins as a list of dates of events concerning [[Elendil]] and his sons, [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]], listing their births and then events concerning them in [[Middle-earth]] after the [[Downfall of Númenor]]. It then lists the Northern and Southern Lines that began with Isildur and Anárion respectively. The Northern Line lists the names, lifespans, birth years, and death years of the [[Kings of Arnor]], [[Kings of Arthedain]], and [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain]]. The Southern Line lists the same for the [[Kings of Gondor]] and [[Ruling Steward|Ruling Stewards of Gondor]]. Interspersed throughout are notes about the reigns of some, but not all, of these figures. Following these a separate list of the lifespans, dates of birth, and dates of death are given for the [[Prince of Dol Amroth|Princes of Dol Amroth]], but in this case most of the names are not given.\n\n[[Category:The Peoples of Middle-earth chapters|Heirs of Elendil]]\n[[fi:The Heirs of Elendil]]"}}}
