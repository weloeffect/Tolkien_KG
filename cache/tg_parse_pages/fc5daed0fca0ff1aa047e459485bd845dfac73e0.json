It lay to the south of the [[East Road]],<ref>{{FR|I3}}</ref> with its chief and central township at [[Tuckborough]] in the [[Green Hills]], where, burrowed into the hillsides, was the famous and historic home of the Tooks, [[Great Smials]]. Somewhat to the west of Tuckborough lay the smaller of the Tookland's main settlements, [[Tookbank]].<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nTookland was the historical province of the [[Took Family|Took clan]], and so of the hereditary [[Thain]]s of the Shire. By the late [[Third Age]] it was one of those folklands who were still home to their ancestral clan, as most Tooks were still found there.<ref>{{FR|Ordering}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Travellers]] passed from Tookland on their way to the [[Green Hill Country]]. \n\nDuring [[Sharkey]]'s occupation, the Tooks were fortified in their smials and didn't allow any [[ruffians]] to enter, having shot three for prowling and robbing. They became nastier and kept a close watch. Around the time of the [[Battle of Bywater]], [[Thain]] [[Paladin Took II]] raised all the country and commanded some troops to drive them  away to the south, and sent a messenger to [[Bywater]].<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Tookland is a region in the southern part of the in-game region of the Shire, the [[Southfarthing]] being not present in the game.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Regions of the Shire]]\n[[de:Tukland]]\n[[fi:Tukinmaa]]"}}}
