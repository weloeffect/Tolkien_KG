Classical realism unites with contemporary storytelling as artist Donato Giancola explores the mythic grandeur and the iconic characters of J.R.R. Tolkien's ''The Lord of the Rings'' saga. \n\nDonato has made it his lifes work to translate Tolkien's words into compelling visuals, with gorgeous oil paintings and drawings reminiscent of Rembrandt and Caravaggio. His interpretations of Middle-earth span his entire career, from private commissions to the 2001 edition of the graphic novel adaptation of ''The Hobbit'', all collected in this massive compendium--a must-have for collectors of Tolkien and fantasy.}}\n\n==External links==\n\n*[https://www.darkhorse.com/Books/3000-663/Middle-Earth-Journeys-in-Myth-and-Legend-HC Presentation] at Dark Horse \n\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Art books]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
