Gondor occupied the fortress until {{TA|1636}} when the [[Great Plague]] killed large parts of the population. During the plague, most of the people of [[Osgiliath]] fled the city for the western dales or the woods of Ithilien.\n\nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of the Plains]] in {{TA|1856}} the Gondorian territories north of Ithilien and east of the river Anduin were abandoned by Gondor.<ref name=\"Northmen\">{{UT|Northmen}}</ref><ref name=\"Narmacil II\">{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Narmacil II</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|1899}}, Marhwini warned [[Calimehtar (King of Gondor)|King Calimehtar]] that the [[Wainriders]] were plotting to raid [[Calenardhon]] over the [[Undeeps]].

''Ithilien'' loc.|website=Eldamo|accessed=06 February 2022}}</ref>\n\nThe name does not refer to the moon or the climate, but is related to the 'heraldic' name of [[Isildur]], the son of [[Elendil]]. It is the counterpart of [[Anorien]], the \"Land of the Sun\".<ref name=\"Nomenclature\" />\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''[[1987]]-[[1996|96]]: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''\n:The ''[[Sea-Lords of Gondor]] - Pelargir and Lebennin'' campaign module contains a detailed map that includes Ithilien.\n\n:The ''[[Southern Gondor: The Land]]'' module contains information about settlements and sites, the history, geography, flora and fauna, inhabitants, politics and power and warcraft of Harithilien. It is mentioned that the Emyn Arnen define the boundary dividing Harithilien (South Ithilien) from Forithilien (North Ithilien).\n\n:In the ''[[The Tower of Cirith Ungol and Shelob's Lair]]'' module there are five adventures that take place in the Tower of Cirith Ungol, Shelob's Lair and the surrounding area. It is mentioned that the river Ithilduin (later renamed to Morgulduin) divides Ithilien into Northern and Southern provinces.\n\n:In the ''[[Ghosts of the Southern Anduin]]'' adventure module there are four adventures that take place in and around the town of Bar-en-Tinnen in Ithilien (renamed to Bar-en-Dinnen in ''Southern Gondor: The Land'').\n\n:In the ''[[Gates of Mordor (book)|Gates of Mordor]]'' adventure module there are two adventures that take place in North Ithilien and one adventure that takes place in [[Durthang]] in the northern Ephel Dúath.\n\n:The ''[[Minas Ithil (book)|Minas Ithil]]'' city module contains detailed information about Minas Ithil (later renamed to Minas Morgul) in T.A. 1640 and three adventures that take place in Minas Ithil.\n\n:''[[The Kin-strife]] campaign module contains detailed information about Minas Ithil (later renamed to Minas Morgul) during the time of the [[Kin-strife]] and three adventures that take place in Minas Ithil.''\n\n'''2015: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Ithilien (North) map.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Map of North Ithilien in''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'' ]]\n\n:Ithilien is split into two game regions, each covering the portion located either north or south of the Cross-roads. Unlike other similar cases in the game, the separation is chronological as well as geographical: South Ithilien is story-wise set before the [[Siege of Gondor]] begins in full, while North Ithilien is set after the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], with the [[Army of the West|Host of the West]] marching towards the [[Black Gate]].\n\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Ithilien (South) map.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Map of South Ithilien in''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'' ]]\nIn the South Ithilien, the main stronghold of the [[Rangers of Ithilien]] is ''Bâr Hurin'' commanded by [[Anborn]], which is later overrun during the war. In the North Ithilien, ''Bâr Aroth'' and ''Bâr Tarnaher'' are similarly overrun, while ''Aelin Veren'' was only briefly passed by and has since been reclaimed from the Enemy. The secrecy of [[Henneth Annûn]] has been abandoned, as it is used to support the Host of the West during its march and would serve no further purpose should its mission fail.\n\n{{references}}\n{{FellowshipRoute}}\n[[Category:Gondor]]\n[[Category:Noldorin locations]]\n[[Category:Regions of Gondor]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/regions/gondor/ithilien]]"}}}
