Balin's body was placed in a tomb in the [[Chamber of Mazarbul]], Balin's former seat, which itself was located off the north end of the [[Twenty-first Hall]].<ref name=Bridge>{{FR|Bridge}}, p. 322</ref>\n\nBut the archer was just the first of the orcs who came up the [[Celebrant|Silverlode]]. After a [[Battle of the Second Hall|fierce battle in the halls]] there was a final [[Last stand of Balin's folk|stand]] in the Chamber of Mazarbul but the dwarves were completely wiped out.\n\nThe [[Fellowship of the Ring]] later found Balin's tomb whilst journeying through Moria in {{TA|3019|n}}. A shaft of light from outside of the mountain fell directly onto the tomb, though it is not known what the shaft originally lit.<ref name=Journey>{{FR|Journey}}</ref> The Chamber was the site of the [[Battle of the Chamber of Mazarbul|battle]] between the Fellowship and a group of attacking orcs.<ref name=Bridge/>\n\nWhen the Fellowship fled the chamber after the battle Gandalf remained behind to hold the door against the orcs. However he unexpectedly found himself matched against an [[Durin's Bane|unknown power]] and the struggle between the two caused the roof of the Chamber of Mazarbul to collapse and bury Balin’s tomb deep beneath the rubble. \n\nIt is not known if the chamber or Balin's tomb were ever recovered when Moria was retaken by the dwarves in the [[Fourth Age]].\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Balin's Tomb.jpg|200px|thumb|''Balin's tomb'' by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]\n\nThe tomb was made of a single oblong block, about two feet high, underneath a large slab of white stone. Runes were cut deeply into the slab:\n\n<center>BALIN<br>FUNDINUL<br>[[Lord of Moria|UZBAD KHAZADDUMU]]<br>BALIN SON OF FUNDIN LORD OF MORIA</center>\n\n===Rune inscription===\nThe runes carved into Balin’s tomb were [[Angerthas Moria]], used before the flight of the Dwarves. Balin’s folk would have followed this example in such a circumstance. The larger top runes (the first three lines) are written in [[Khuzdul]], while the smaller ones of the final line were in the [[Westron|Common Speech]], written with [[Angerthas Erebor]].<ref>{{App|Cirth}}</ref>\n\nThe Dwarves never used their \"true\" Khuzdul names, not even in inscriptions, but rather their names in a [[Mannish]] dialect of the [[Northmen]].<ref>{{App|F1iv}}</ref> [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]], having translated all uses of Mannish into modern English and Norse, rendered these names as \"Balin\" and \"Fundin\" as he did the other words in the last line of the inscription (see note on English below). The name \"Moria\" was used, for by the time of the inscription, it had become the accepted name for Khazad-dûm in the Common Speech.\n\nThe use of English to represent the Common Speech in primary sources such as the inscription on Balin's tomb was a result of Tolkien's vision of completely translating all [[Westron]] into modern English,<ref>{{TI|Dwarf}}</ref> even in authentic documentation, although upon reflection Tolkien said that this translation was \"an erroneous extension of the general linguistic treatment\".<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}, pp. 298-9</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Balin's tomb in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring - Balin's Tomb.jpg|Balin's tomb in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Balin's Tomb.jpg|Balin's tomb in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''\n:Balin's tomb is referred to as '''Balin's Tomb''' and is portrayed on film exactly as described in the book.
