Because of this attack, half of Trestlebridge lies in ashes. The  Orcs of [[Angmar]] have made encampments to the north of the Trestlespan to attack the city.<ref>{{LOTROW|Nellie Boskins|2025-08-13}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, Nellie Boskins was not willing to participate with the newly formed Council, but when the [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]] of [[Esteldín]] - and the player - came to help them unlooked for, she was grateful. The Orcs had just gathered to strike Trestlebridge, and this battle became known as the Battle of Trestlebridge. The Council won and Nellie Boskins joined it.<ref>{{LOTROW|Quest:Instance: The Defence of Trestlebridge|2025-08-13}}</ref>\n==Description==\nTrestlebridge lies in the north of [[Bree-land]], at the midway point between [[Bree]] and [[Fornost]], with the [[Greenway]] running trough it. To the north lies the chasm Cirith Núr, which is bridged by the wooden bridge the Trestlespan. Half of the city is burned down and it is here where one can start the Wildwood content, an area you can buy.<ref>{{LOTROW|Trestlebridge|2025-08-13}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nA trestle bridge is a type of bridge that carries the load in multiple shorter spans.<ref>{{WP|Trestle bridge}}</ref> \n\n''Cirith Núr'' comes from the word ''cirith'', meaning \"cleft\" in [[Sindarin]]<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entry ''kir''</ref> and ''núr'', coming from the rivers name ''Núrsir'', which is made of the words ''núr'', meaning \"sad\"<ref>{{UT|Index}}, entry ''Núrnen''</ref> and ''sîr'', meaning \"stream\".<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, ''sîr''</ref> That makes \"Cleft of the Sad Stream\".\n{{references}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings Online locations]]"}}}
