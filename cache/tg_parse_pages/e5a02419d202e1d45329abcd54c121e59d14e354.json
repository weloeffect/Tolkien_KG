Tolkien]]'s scholarly linguistic essays and lectures. The book was edited by [[Christopher Tolkien]] and published posthumously in [[1983]].\n\nAll of them were initially delivered as lectures to academics, with the exception of ''On Translating Beowulf'', which Christopher Tolkien notes in his foreword is not addressed to an academic audience.\n\n==Contents==\nSeven essays are included in the book, some of which had been published before, while others were presented for the first time in print.\n\n* Foreword\n* \"[[Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics]]\" — lecture delivered in [[1936]], looks at the critics' understanding of ''[[Beowulf (poem)|Beowulf]]'', and proposes a fresh take on the poem\n* \"[[Prefatory Remarks on Prose Translation of 'Beowulf'|On Translating Beowulf]]\" — published in [[1940]], looks at the difficulties in translating the poem from Old English\n* \"[[On Fairy-stories]]\" — lecture delivered in [[1939]], a defence of the fantasy genre\n* \"[[A Secret Vice]]\" — lecture delivered in [[1931]], talks about creating imaginary languages, giving background to Tolkien's [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]]\n* \"[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]\" — [[W.P. Ker Lecture|lecture]] delivered in [[1953]], a study of the medieval poem of the same name\n* \"[[English and Welsh]]\" — lecture delivered in [[1955]], a survey of the historical relationship between the two tongues, including an analysis of the word ''Welsh''\n* \"[[Valedictory Address to the University of Oxford]]\" — lecture delivered in [[1959]], given upon Tolkien's retirement from Oxford\n\n==From the publisher==\n{{blockquote|The seven 'essays' by J.R.R. Tolkien assembled in this new paperback edition were with one exception delivered as general lectures on particular occasions; and while they mostly arose out of Tolkien's work in medieval literature, they are accessible to all. Two of them are concerned with ''Beowulf'', including the well-known lecture whose title is taken for this book, and one with ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', given in the University of Glasgow in 1953.<br>\nAlso included in this volume is the lecture ''English and Welsh''; the ''Valedictory Address to the University of Oxford'' in 1959; and a paper on Invented Languages delivered in 1931, with exemplification from poems in the Elvish tongues. Most famous of all is ''On Fairy-Stories'', a discussion of the nature of fairy-tales and fantasy, which gives insight into Tolkien's approach to the whole genre.<br>\nThe pieces in this collection cover a period of nearly thirty years, beginning six years before the publication of ''The Hobbit'', with a unique 'academic' lecture on his invention (calling it ''A Secret Vice'') and concluding with his farewell to professorship, five years after the publication of ''The Lord of the Rings''.}}\n\n==Relation to the legendarium==\nAs these essays are of a scholarly nature, there are scarcely any direct references to the [[legendarium]] of Tolkien. However, the essay \"A Secret Vice\" contains a final section of ''Notes'' by Christopher Tolkien, where he points to references to ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two|The Book of Lost Tales]]'' and also reprints  a later version of one of the Elvish poems, being \"one of the major pieces of [[Quenya]]\".<ref>Chistopher Tolkien, \"Foreword\", p.4.</ref>\n\n==Publication history and gallery==\n;UK editions\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"125px\" heights=\"125px\">\nFile:The Monsters and the Critics 1983.png|1983 hardcover\nFile:The Monsters and the Critics 1997.png|1997 paperback\nFile:The Monsters and the Critics 2006.png|2006 paperback\nFile:The Monsters and the Critics 2025.jpeg|2025 paperback\n</gallery>\n* [[George Allen and Unwin]], hardcover ([[1983]]), pp.&nbsp;240.
