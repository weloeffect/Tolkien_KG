Tolkien]], [[Letter 294]]}}\n'''Latin''' is a language belonging to the Italic group of the Indo-European language family. It was spoken in ancient Rome, and, although now considered a dead language, it was the ancestor of the Romance family of languages such as Spanish; in the previous centuries, it has been a prestigious language of scientists and scholars, and the ceremonial language of the Catholic Church.\n\nThere have been modern attempts to translate some famous works into Latin, including ''[[The Hobbit]]'' with the title ''[[Hobbitus Ille]]'' by Mark Walker.\n\n==Tolkien and Latin==\n[[Tolkien]] had a great appreciation for Latin. He was taught Latin at a young age by his Mother, [[Mabel Tolkien]]. He took great interest in both the sounds and meanings of words. This marked the start of Tolkien's love for linguistics and philology. Tolkien studied Latin at [[King Edward's School]],<ref>{{B|II}}</ref> and would continue studying it the rest of his life.\n\nAs a deeply religious person, Latin also held significance to Tolkien due to its use in the [[Catholicism|Catholic Church]]. During the period [[1962]]-[[1965|65]] the Catholic Church went through the process of switching from Latin to the local vernacular.[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrosanctum_Concilium] This greatly displeased Tolkien.<ref>{{B|IV}}</ref> [[Simon Tolkien]] J.R.R. Tolkien's grandson wrote the following:\n\n{{Blockquote|I vividly remember going to church with him in Bournemouth. He was a devout Roman Catholic and it was soon after the Church had changed the liturgy from Latin to English. My Grandfather obviously didn't agree with this and made all the responses very loudly in Latin while the rest of the congregation answered in English. I found the whole experience quite excruciating, but My Grandfather was oblivious. He simply had to do what he believed to be right.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Simon Tolkien]]|articleurl=https://www.simontolkien.com/mygrandfather|articlename=My Grandfather - JRR Tolkien|dated=2003|website=simontolkien.com|accessed=11 January 2024}}</ref>|}}\n\n==Influence on invented languages==\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Excerpt from the Mass.jpg|thumb|Excerpt from the canon of the Mass in Latin and [[Tengwar]] transcription by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]\n===Quenya ===\n[[Quenya]], the elvish language of the [[Noldor]] and [[Vanyar]], is very similar to Latin from both a linguistic perspective and in the way it was used. By the [[Third Age]] Quenya had fallen out of vernacular use and was mostly a scholarly pursuit. It was considered prestigious and mostly used ceremonially and in important or old literature and song. It is because of this that Tolkien refers to Quenya as an Elven-Latin.<ref>{{App|Elves}}</ref><ref>{{L|347}}</ref>\n\nQuenya phonology and spelling are most similar to Latin with Finnish phonological rules.<ref>{{App|E1}}</ref> \nGrammar in Quenya is also based on Latin grammar though to a lesser extent than Finnish. Quenya and Latin are highly inflected languages allowing both to have flexible word order.<ref group=note>Although Quenya and Latin both have fairly free word order the most common order in Quenya is subject-verb-object while Latin is most commonly subject-object-verb.</ref>\n\n===Nevbosh and Naffarin===\nOne of Tolkien's first attempts at creating a language was [[Nevbosh]].<ref>[[Michael D.C. Drout]], ed., ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia: Scholarship and Critical Assessment]]''</ref> Tolkien then went on to create [[Naffarin]] in the 1910s, based partially on Nevbosh. These both included aspects of Latin and Spanish.<ref>[[Michael D.C. Drout]], ed., ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia: Scholarship and Critical Assessment]]'', p. 222</ref><ref>{{MC|6}}</ref>\n\n==External links==\n*{{WP|Latin}}\n* [http://glaemscrafu.jrrvf.com/english/latin.html Texts and sound samples] at [[Glǽmscrafu]]\n*[https://antigonejournal.com/2022/01/farmer-giles-tolkien-latin/ The joys of Latin and Christmas feasts: J.R.R.
