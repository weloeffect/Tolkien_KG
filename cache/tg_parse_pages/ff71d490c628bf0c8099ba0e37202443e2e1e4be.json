Its name translates from [[Quenya]] as the '''''Lonely Island''''', for it lay originally in the middle of the [[Belegaer]], far from any other landmasses. \n\n[[Ulmo]] pushed it back and forth across [[Belegaer]] twice to transport the [[Elves]] to [[Aman]]. After that, it came to rest forever just off the eastern shore of that continent in the [[Bay of Eldamar]], and was inhabited by the [[Teleri]] of Aman, until they left for [[Alqualondë]].\n\nWith the end of the [[First Age]], many of the [[Eldar]] of [[Middle-earth]] (and the Teleri that never left it) went to Aman, and lived on the island of Tol Eressëa. Its principal location is the port city of [[Avallónë]] on the eastern shore.\n\n==History==\n====The founding of Tol Eressëa====\nWhen the time came for the [[Eldar]] to go to the undying lands of [[Aman]] in the west, the [[Valar]] bid [[Ulmo]] to bring them there safely. As they could not cross the treacherous pass of ice in the north called the [[Helcaraxë]] that connected the lands, Ulmo uprooted an island that was in the middle of [[Belegaer]], standing in the middle of the sea since the fall of the lamp [[Illuin]]. With the aid of his servants, he moved the island like a mighty ship to the east and anchored it in the [[Bay of Balar]]. Then the elven groups of the [[Vanyar]] and the [[Noldor]] went upon it and were drawn across the sea to Aman, where they came into the region of [[Valinor]].<ref name=\"Eldalie\">{{S|5}}</ref>\n\nThe largest and latest group of the elves to depart, the [[Teleri]], reached the shores of [[Beleriand]] at the [[Mouths of Sirion]] and dwelt there for many years. There they took [[Olwë]] to be their king. Then [[Ossë]] and [[Uinen]] came and befriended them, with Ossë teaching them much sea lore and sea music. Ever after, the Teleri would be accounted as the best singers and mariners among the [[Quendi]].<ref name=\"Eldalie\" />\n\nAcross the sea in the west, [[Finwë]], who had been great friends with the Teleri, besought Ulmo to bring his friends to Aman if they would come. Ulmo agreed and brought the offer to the Teleri, which they accepted. Ossë was grieved at their departure, and so convinced a group to stay behind that would become the [[Falathrim]].<ref name=\"Eldalie\" />\n\nThe Teleri drew onto a great isle, which Ulmo dragged across the sea. Ossë followed Ulmo and when the isle reached the [[Bay of Eldamar]], he called to the Teleri who heard his voice and begged Ulmo to stay their voyage. Ulmo, understanding the hearts of the Teleri, and having spoken against their summons at the councils of the Valar, granted their request, and with Ossë the two rooted the island to the foundations of the sea. The isle was ever after called Tol Eressëa, the lonely isle.<ref name=\"Eldalie\" />\n\nFinwë and the Valar grieved to know the group would not now come to Aman. And the Teleri on the isle began to grow apart from the mainland, abiding under the stars of heaven with the sight of Aman in the distance.<ref name=\"Eldalie\" /> This sundering led to the development of their own language, [[Telerin]].<ref>[[David Salo]], ''[[A Gateway to Sindarin]]'', \"The History of Sindarin\"</ref>\n\nThe Valar wished still to the see the Lonely Isle, and so created a gap in the [[Pelóri]] called the [[Calacirya]], and after the light of Aman reached the shores of Tol Eressëa and made the lands grow fertile and the waters around it shone in silver and gold. There on the isle, the first flowers east of the Pelóri grew.<ref name=\"Eldalie\" />\n\nAfter the construction of the city of [[Tirion]], and the gifting of the white tree of [[Galathilion]] to the Eldar by [[Yavanna]], a seedling of Galathilion was given to the elves of Tol Eressëa, who planted it there and named it [[Celeborn (White Tree)|Celeborn]]. This tree would go on to later give the seedling [[Nimloth (tree)|Nimloth]] to the people of [[Númenóreans|Númenor]].<ref name=\"Eldalie\" />\n\nAfter many years, the Teleri were torn for the love of the sea and their desire to see the light of Valinor and their sundered kindred again. Therefore, Ulmo sent Ossë to the Teleri. Ossë taught them how to build ships and gave them many strong winged swans which pulled the ships to Aman. Many came and saw the realm of Aman. Most sailed their ships near the shores and walked in the waves on the beaches.<ref name=\"Eldalie\" />\n\nThe Noldor gave them many gems of opal, pale diamond and crystal, which the Teleri scattered across the shores of [[Elendë]]. They built the city of [[Alqualondë]] on the shores of Aman, and the Teleri found many pearls at sea which they used to adorn their halls and the mansion of Olwë. The city was lit with many lamps, it was filled with ships fashioned into the shape of swans, and the gate of their harbor was an arch of living rock carved by the sea.<ref name=\"Eldalie\" />\n\n====The end of the First Age====\nNear the ending of the [[First Age]], after [[Beleriand]] had undergone many battles and much despair, and [[Morgoth]] had at last found and destroyed [[Gondolin]], [[Eärendil]] the Mariner decided he should go to [[Valinor]] and ask the [[Valar]] for pity on the [[Edain]] and the [[Eldar]] in Beleriand. His wife [[Elwing]], who had cast herself into the sea was borne up by [[Ulmo]], and given wings, so that she may fly with the [[Silmarils|Silmaril]] that she possessed to Eärendil. Once she found him aboard his ship [[Vingilot]], she fell into his arms, and he placed the Silmaril on his brow and sailed the ship toward Valinor with Elwing at his side. The light of the Silmaril grew greater as they neared Valinor and as they passed the isle of Tol Eressëa.<ref name=\"Earendil\">{{S|24}}</ref>\n\nAfter Eärendil spoke with the Valar, they gave him and Elwing the choice of mortality as a Man or immortality as an Elf. Both chose the life of an elf, and Eärendil went on his ship Vingilot through the [[Door of Night]], to then sail the ship to and from across the skies. Elwing took again to her bird form and the elves of Tol Eressëa would watch her from afar flying to greet Vingilot.<ref name=\"Earendil\" />\n\nAfter the [[War of Wrath]], many of the elves that dwelt in Beleriand came to live on Tol Eressëa, and they were soon forgiven by the Valar and [[Teleri]] alike for all the hurt they had done.<ref name=\"Earendil\" />\n\n====The Second Age====\nFollowing [[Morgoth]]'s defeat at the end of the [[First Age]], the [[Second Age]] began,<ref>{{App|SA}}, p. 1082</ref> and the Valar called the elves to return to the West.\n\nThose that came went and dwelt in the isle of Tol Eressëa, and in its chief city [[Avallónë]]. The tower of Avallónë was the first sight a mariner beheld when journeying to the Undying Lands. Ossë raised [[Númenor]] from out of the depths of the ocean and gifted it to the Edain. The Eldar brought flowers and fountains from Tol Eressëa and gifted them to the [[Númenóreans]].<ref name=\"Numenor\">{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>\n\nThe Númenóreans spoke [[Elvish]] which, they had learned from both the elves of Middle-Earth and Tol Eressëa. The Númenóreans could see Tol Eressëa from their isle, and from there, the elves would visit Númenor in oarless boats shaped like white birds. The elves brought many gifts including: birds of song, fragrant flowers, and herbs of great virtue. The chief most of the gifts was a seedling from their white tree, [[Celeborn (White Tree)|Celeborn]]. The seedling would grow to be [[Nimloth (tree)|Nimloth]], the White Tree of Númenor.<ref name=\"Numenor\" />\n\nWhen the Númenóreans began to grow jealous of the lands of Aman and of the immortality of the west, the Eldar reported them to the Valar. [[Manwë]] sent them back as messengers to the men. The Eldar arrived at the Isle of Númenor during the reign of [[Tar-Atanamir]]. The Eldar tried to reason with them that the Eldar and the Edain were to have separate fates, but most of the men of Númenor would not listen and stopped welcoming death as part of their fate. The men drew into two groups thereafter: the [[King's Men]], who grew apart from the teachings and trust of the Eldar, and the [[Elf-friends|Elendili]], the elf-friends who still trusted in their ways.<ref name=\"Numenor\" />\n\nAs the years went on, the Númenóreans drew further into their dark days, forsaking more and more the guidance of the Eldar and the decrees of the Valar. During the reign of [[Ar-Gimilzôr]], the White Tree was untended and the use of Elvish was forbade. Those that welcomed the ships of Eressëa were punished. The Valar grew angry with the Númenóreans and the ships from Eressëa never again visted Númenor.<ref name=\"Numenor\" />\n\nEven when [[Tar-Palantir]] took the scepter, and wished again for friendship with the elves, they did not come and Avallónë was veiled in cloud, out of his sight. [[Sauron]] deceived the twenty-fifth and final King of Númenor, [[Ar-Pharazôn]] into taking him as his hostage and later as an advisor.<ref name=\"Numenor\" />\n\nSauron soon convinced Pharazôn to wage war against the Valar and defy the [[Ban of the Valar|ban]] that was laid upon them, forbidding them from entering Aman. This led to the downfall of Númenor, where Ar-Pharazôn gathered a great fleet of ships and sailed to the coast of Aman. From Avallónë the Eldar watched and mourned for the sun that was cut off by the cloud of the Númenóreans.<ref name=\"Numenor\" />\n\nManwë called upon [[Ilúvatar]], who then opened a great chasm in the sea, into which all the faithless fleet sunk into alongside the entire island of Númenor. The lands of Aman and Tol Eressëa were drawn away from the reach of Men forever, into the realm of hidden things. Only nine ships of the Númenóreans escaped, carrying the [[Elendili]], which went then to [[Middle-earth]] to establish their realms. Then only by those who were permitted could Aman and Eressëa be reached by way of the [[Straight Road]], which was a secret road that passed through the atmosphere of [[Ilmen]], and back down until it reached Eressëa and Aman again.<ref name=\"Numenor\" />\n\n====The Third Age====\nAfter the downfall of [[Númenor]], the surviving [[Elf-friends|Elendili]] brought to [[Middle-earth|Middle-Earth]], their seven [[Palantíri]] which they were given by the elves to comfort them during the dark days, when the elves no longer came to Númenor. Three of the Palantíri were taken by [[Elendil]], two by [[Isildur]] and two by [[Anárion]]. Elendil placed his in the tower [[Elostirion]] in [[Tower Hills|Emyn Beraid]], in [[Weathertop|Amon Sûl]], and in the city of [[Annúminas]]. His sons set the others in [[Minas Morgul|Minas Ithil]], [[Minas Tirith|Minas Anor]], [[Orthanc]] and [[Osgiliath]]. Elendil would often look through the stone of Elostirion, seeing even as far as the [[Tower of Avallónë]] in Tol Eressëa, where the Master Stone resided.<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref>\n\n==Flora==\nMany beautiful trees grew on Eressëa, and their seedlings were gifted by the Eldar to [[Númenor]] to enrich the land, such as ''[[oiolairë]]'', ''[[lairelossë]]'', ''[[nessamelda]]'', ''[[vardarianna]]'', ''[[taniquelassë]]'', ''[[yavannamírë]]'', and the mighty ''[[malinornë]]''.<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}, p. 216</ref>\n\nIts flora also included flowers such as that of ''[[lissuin]]'' and ''[[elanor]]''.<ref>{{UT|4}}, p. 243</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Tol Eressëa'' is [[Quenya]], from ''[[tol]]'' (\"isle\") + ''[[eressëa]]'' (\"lonely\").<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3633419585.html|articlename=Q. ''Tol Eressëa'' loc.|website=Eldamo|accessed=18 March 2024}}</ref>\n\n==Other names==\nIn one of [[Edwin Lowdham]]'s [[Old English]] texts, the island is called ''Ánetíg''.<ref>{{SD|2eiv}}, p. 316</ref> This name occurs elsewhere with the meaning of \"Solitary Isle\".<ref>{{SM|VA1b}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn the early versions of Tolkien's [[legendarium]], the island was later visited by [[Ælfwine]] (or [[Eriol]]), an Anglo-Saxon from the early Middle Ages, which provided a framework for the tales that later became ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.\n\nMost of ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part One]]'' occurs on Tol Eressëa. The island played a significant role in those early conflicting and revised versions, as the homeland of the Noldorin exiles. From those stories, [[Christopher Tolkien]] provided a comparative summary of its story: After the war between the [[Eldar]] and the [[Enemy]] in the [[Great Lands]] (i.e. Middle-earth), Eressea is the destination for the exiled [[Noldoli]] who were rescued from the Great Lands, as some were not allowed to return to Valinor. The exiles built many towns and villages, and places such as [[Tavrobel]], the central region of [[Alalminórë]] with the hill of [[Kôr]] where [[Ingil]] son of [[Ingwe|Inwe]] built [[Kortirion]]. The [[House of the Hundred Chimneys]] and the [[Cottage of Lost Play]] of Kortirion are also mentioned. These names do not exist in the later ''Silmarillion''.\n\nThe island was visited by [[Ottor Wǽfre]] who, after learning the ancient history of the [[Elder Days]] went to visit [[Gilfanon]] in Tavrobel, where he wrote it down. He married an Elf and had a son named [[Heorrenda]].\n\nTol Eressëa was drawn again east and anchored off the coasts of the Great Lands (at the geographical position of England), where the Lost Elves rose against the servants of Melko. When Osse attempted to drag the island back to the West, the western half broke off, forming the Isle of [[Iverin]] (Ireland).\n\nAfter the defeat of the Elves in the battle of [[Ros]], they hid in Tol Eressëa, but were followed by evil men, [[Orcs]] and other creatures. The great [[Battle of the Heath of the Sky-roof]] between Men near Tavrobel causes the Elves to flee over the [[Gruir]] and the [[Afros]].\n\nThe Elves then faded, and most [[Men]] were now unable to see them. Eriol's sons, Hengest, Horsa, and Heorrenda, who were friendly to the Elves, conquered the island which became 'England'. From them the Angles have 'the true tradition of the fairies'. Hengest came to Kortirion (Warwick), Horsa to [[Taruithorn]] ([[Oxford]]) and Heorrenda to [[Tavrobel]] (Great Haywood).<ref>{{LT2|VI}}</ref>\n\nA [[Gnomish]] name used for Tol Eressëa was '''''Dor Faidwen''''' (\"Land of Release\").<ref>{{LT1|I}}, pp. 13, 21</ref><ref>{{PE|11}}, pp. 5, 7</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tol Eressea}}\n\n[[Category:Aman]]\n[[Category:Islands]]\n[[Category:Qenya locations]]\n[[Category:Quenya locations]]\n[[Category:Tol Eressëa| ]]\n[[de:Tol Eressea]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/eaux/iles/tol eressea]]\n[[fi:Tol Eressëa]]"}}}
