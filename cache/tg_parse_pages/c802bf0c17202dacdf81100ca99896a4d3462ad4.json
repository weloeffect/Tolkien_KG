His words were few save in matters that touched him near, and then his voice had a power to move those that heard him and to overthrow those that withstood him.|''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', \"[[Of Maeglin]]\"}}</center>\n\n'''Maeglin''' was an [[Elves|Elf]], the son of [[Eöl]] the [[Dark Elf]] and [[Aredhel]] sister of [[Turgon]]. Born in [[Nan Elmoth]], he became mighty in [[Gondolin]] and betrayed it to [[Morgoth]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Early history ===\nWhen Aredhel left Gondolin to wander through [[Beleriand]], she met [[Eöl]] in [[Nan Elmoth]]. She stayed with him, eventually giving birth to Maeglin. The child grew up hearing tales of Gondolin, the Hidden City, and his uncle, Turgon. Most importantly, he heard that he had no heir to the throne, thus the idea of leaving the dark places of Nan Elmoth was born in his mind. Years later, Aredhel left Eöl and she took Maeglin (who stole his father's sword, [[Anguirel]]) with her, both of them returning to Gondolin. However, Eöl had followed her. In judgment before [[Turgon]], he was told that he could not leave Gondolin, and attempted to kill Maeglin with a poisoned dart. But he hit Aredhel instead when she sprang before Maeglin to protect him. She later died, and Eöl was cast down to his death from the city walls under Maeglin's eyes; his father prophesied that he would die the same death.<ref name=Maeglin/>\n\nHe was now an orphan, but Turgon held him in honor, and Maeglin both learned and taught much. He found rich lodes of metals in the [[Echoriath]] surrounding the city, and forged weapons of steel stronger than had been seen before. His mine in the northern Echoriath was named ''[[Anghabar]]'', which provided a great wealth of steel and forged metals.<ref name=Maeglin>{{S|Maeglin}}</ref> \n\nIn the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], also known as the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, Maeglin refused to remain behind as regent, and went forth to battle with Turgon, proving valiant at need, though he was wise in council as well.<ref name=Maeglin>{{S|Maeglin}}</ref> He was present when Turgon and Húrin met in the middle of the battle, and heard the prophetic words of his king, and he didn't forget them.<ref>{{S|Nirnaeth}}</ref> After the army of the Gondolindrim came back from battle, the seventh and final gate of Gondolin, the [[Gate of Steel]], was created by Maeglin.<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}, pp. 49-50</ref>\n[[File:Peter Xavier Price - Evil in His Heart.jpg|thumb|''Evil in his heart'' by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]] \nEven though he was one of the mighty of Gondolin, he most desired Turgon's daughter [[Idril]], who was his first cousin. But there was no hope for him, as the \"[[Eldar]] wedded not with kin so near\". Moreover, Idril perceived an evil coming from him, and for as long as Gondolin existed, she avoided him. Thus, the love inside Maeglin's heart turned to darkness. Though he had neither her nor the kingship of Gondolin, he endured it in silence, waiting for an opportunity to seize them both.<ref name=Maeglin />\n\n=== Fall of Gondolin ===\nWhen [[Tuor]] came, carrying [[Ulmo's warning]] of the danger to Gondolin, Maeglin sat on the right hand of Turgon and argued against Tuor. Tuor's marriage with Idril further incensed Maeglin, who rebelled against Turgon and Tuor. Later, seeking after metals, Maeglin defied Turgon's order to stay within the mountains, and was captured by [[Orcs]] and brought to [[Angband]]. [[Morgoth]] promised both Gondolin and Idril in return for the location of the hidden city, thus luring Maeglin into the greatest treachery done in the [[Elder Days]].\n\nMaeglin returned to Gondolin saying nothing about his encounter, but many people noticed a change. Most thought it was for the better, though Idril suspected something and began work on [[Idril's secret way]]. When the [[Fall of Gondolin]] took place, Maeglin laid hands on Idril and on her son [[Eärendil]]. But Tuor caught up with him and they fought upon the walls of the city. Maeglin lost and he was thrown down to his death, striking the mountain three times before falling into the flames.<ref>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Maeglin'' means \"Sharp Glance\" in [[Sindarin]], a name which he received from his father when he was twelve. It is formed by the union of ''[[maeg]]'' (\"sharp, piercing, \"penetrating\") and ''[[glîn]]'' (\"gleam, glint (of eyes)\").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entries ''maeg'', ''glîn''</ref> \n\nAt birth, Aredhel gave Maeglin the [[Amilessë|mother-name]] of '''''Lómion''''', meaning \"Child of Twilight\" in [[Quenya]]. It comes from ''[[lómë]]'' (\"twilight\")<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entry ''lómë''</ref>  + ''[[-ion]]'' (patronymic suffix). This name was given to him in secret, as Quenya was forbidden and because only Eöl gave a name to his son when he was twelve years old.<ref name=Maeglin />\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| MIR |y| FIN |y| IND | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |FIN=[[Finwë]]<br /><small>''d. {{YT|1495}}''</small>|IND=[[Indis]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|MIR=[[Míriel]]<br /><small>''d. {{YT|1170}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | |!| | | |)|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.| | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | FEA | | FDS | | FNG |y| ANA | | IRM | | FIR | | |FEA=[[Fëanor]]<br /><small>''{{YT|1169}} - {{YT|1497|n}}''</small>|FDS=[[Findis]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|FNG=[[Fingolfin]]<br /><small>''{{YT|1190}} - {{FA|456}}''</small>|ANA=[[Anairë]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|IRM=[[Írimë]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|FIR=[[Finarfin]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT|1230}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| |,|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree| FIN | | TUR |y| ELE | | ARE |y| EOL | | ARG|FIN=[[Fingon]]<br /><small>''{{YT|1260}} - {{FA|472}}''</small>|ARE=[[Aredhel]]<br /><small>''{{YT|1362}} - {{FA|400}}''</small>|TUR=[[Turgon]]<br /><small>''{{YT|1300}} - {{FA|510}}''</small>|ELE=[[Elenwë]]<br /><small>''d. {{YT|1500}}''</small>|EOL=[[Eöl]]<br /><small>''d. {{FA|400}}''</small>|ARG=[[Argon]]<br /><small>''d. {{FA|1}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | |!| | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | TUO |y| IDR | | | | | | MAE | | | | | ||MAE='''MAEGLIN'''<br /><small>''{{FA|320}} - {{FA|510|n}}''</small>|IDR=[[Idril]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|TUO=[[Tuor]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA|472}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| | | | | EAR | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | ||EAR=[[Eärendil]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA|503}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\n=== ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' ===\n[[File:Catherine Chmiel - Maeglin laid hands on Idril, and on Earendil.jpg|right|thumb|''Maeglin laid hands on Idril, and on Earendil'' by [[Catherine Karina Chmiel]]]]\nMaeglin is called '''''Meglin''''' in the early versions of the [[legendarium]]. This [[Gnomish]] name is not glossed and its [[Qenya]] cognate was ''Mailin/Mailindo''.<ref>{{PE|13}}, pp. 103-4</ref>\n\nThe most detailed text about Meglin and his evil deeds during the Fall of Gondolin is the chapter \"[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]\", in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]''. There it is told that he was a [[Gnome]]-lord, son of Isfin and Eöl, and nephew of king Turgon, although some whispered he had Orc's blood in his veins. His sign was a sable Mole and he was a chief of the delvers, and many of them belonged to his house.<ref name=Gondolin>{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|165}} This house was the [[folk of the Mole]], one of the [[twelve houses of the Gondothlim]]. He had gathered them chosing warriors of dark countenance and lowering gaze.<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|173}}\nAt some point he was captured by Orcs while looking for ore, and knowing he was of the [[Gondothlim]], they would kill him, but he offered himself to Melko and was taken to the Hills of Iron. Hearing the treachery, Melko was pleased, and together they planned how to take the city. Meglin gave Melko the idea of building [[Iron Dragons]] to carry Orcs. Then he came back to the city, but Melko wove upon him the spell of bottomless dread.<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|169}}\n\nSeven years later, the armies of Melko approached Gondolin and Turgon called a council. All the lords supported Tuor, who wanted to leave the city and save the women and children, but Meglin and [[Salgant]] alone convinced [[Turgon]] to hold the city and guard the treasures, and while he spoke Salgant backed him up.<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|175–6}}\n\nWhen the [[Fall of Gondolin]] began at the northern gate, Meglin led his folk to [[Tuor]]'s house at the south of the city. He knew of [[Idril's secret way]] and wanted to use it for his own purposes. There he tried to kill [[Eärendel]] throwing him from the walls, and dragged Idril of her hair to make her see it. But Eärendel and Idril fought him, delaying him. Tuor soon arrived with his [[folk of the Wing]]. But a press of the Mole-folk was in front of the house, and these were the grimmest Noldoli that Meglin could get, doing nothing to stop their lord. Then the folk of the Wing attacked and the folk of the Mole was stricken asunder, and Tuor could run upon Meglin. When Meglin saw this, he stabbed Eärendel, but the child was wearing a coat, and Tuor broke Meglin's arm. Finally, Tuor took Meglin and flung him far out. The body smote Amon Gwareth three times before reaching the flames, \"and the name of Meglin has gone out in shame from among the Eldar and Noldoli\".<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|177–8}}\n\n{{references}}\n{{HousesofGondolin}}\n\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Gondolindrim]]\n[[Category:House of Fingolfin]]\n[[Category:Moriquendi]]\n[[Category:Noldor]]\n[[Category:Servants of Melkor]]\n[[Category:Sindar]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n[[Category:Smiths]]\n[[de:Maeglin]]\n[[fi:Maeglin]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/elfes/noldor/maeglin]]"}}}
