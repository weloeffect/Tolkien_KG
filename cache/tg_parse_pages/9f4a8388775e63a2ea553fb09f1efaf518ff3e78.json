In {{TA|2}} Isildur planted the second [[White Tree of Gondor]] in Minas Anor in memory of his brother, who had perished during the [[Siege of Barad-dûr]].

In {{TA|2002}} Minas Ithil, where the guard on Mordor had long since slackened, was [[Second Fall of Minas Ithil|captured]] by the [[Nazgûl]].

Seeing this [[Imrahil]], [[Prince of Dol Amroth]], led a sally from the city, and the three armies were able to break the siege in the decisive [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].<ref name=\"RK-Pelennor\">{{RK|Battle}}</ref>\n\nOn [[1 May]] {{TA|3019}}, returning with the victorious from the [[Battle of the Morannon]], Aragorn was crowned on the plain outside Minas Tirith, and he entered the city as King Elessar. On [[25 June]] he discovered a sapling of the line of [[Nimloth of Númenor|Nimloth]] in a hidden hallow of Mount Mindolluin.

The City Wall was vulnerable only to earthquakes capable of rending the ground where it stood.<ref name=\"RK-MinasTirith\"/>\n\nEach level was walled and held a gate with each gate faced a different direction: only the great gate and that of the seventh level faced east; the gate to the second level faced southeast, and that to the third faced northeast; so altering between the two such that the path up through the levels wound to and fro rather than following a straight line. An outcropping of rock as high as the seventh level bisected all the lower levels except the lowest on the line of the [[Great Gate of Minas Tirith|Great Gate]]. The winding path through the city therefore passed through tunnels in this 'keel' five times. \n\nThe '''First Level''' included the [[Rath Celerdain]], a white paved street with an inn, the [[Old Guesthouse]].\n\nThe '''Sixth Level''' contained stables for riders, and the [[Houses of Healing]]. There was also [[Fen Hollen]], a door which was almost always closed, leading to [[Rath Dínen]],<ref name=\"RK-MinasTirith\" /> the 'shoulder' of rock that joined the Hill to the main mass of Mount Mindolluin rose to the level of the fifth wall and was fortified with large ramparts, where the tombs of the Kings of Gondor and their Stewards lay. The uppermost tunnel was delved into the spur of rock that jutted out of the eastern face of the Hill; The keystone of its archway was carved with the head of a crowned King. [[Guards of the Citadel]] manned the Seventh Gate which faced eastward in line with the Great Gate 700 feet below and emerged into the Citadel, the city's strongest point, surrounded by high walls and battlements on the 'keel'. \n\nThe '''Citadel''' housed the [[Court of the Fountain (Minas Tirith)|Court of the Fountain]] and the [[Tower of Ecthelion]], which brought the total height of the city to 1000 feet.<ref group=\"note\">On the basis of this figure and unpublished sketches by Tolkien [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] estimated the breadth of the city at 3100 feet in her ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth|Atlas]]''.</ref> Before the Tower grew the [[White Tree of Gondor|White Tree]] in a court. There were also the [[King's House]], lodgings for the Steward, [[Merethrond]], barracks for the Guard of the Citadel, and other buildings for guests and other workers.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Minas Tirith'' is a [[Sindarin]] name,<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, entry S ''Minas Tirith'', p. 31</ref> which means \"Tower of Guard\"<ref name=Guard/> or \"Tower of Watch\".<ref name=PE17/> Paul Strack suggests that the name is a combination of ''[[minas]]'' (\"tower\", \"fort\", \"city\") and ''[[tirith]]'' (\"watch\", \"ward\", \"guard\").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-538283653.html|articlename=S.

''Gemen'' means \"care\", \"heed\" or \"watch\". ''Heatorras'' means \"high towers\" and ''Mundbeorg'' means \"protection-hill\".<ref>{{TI|King}}, Notes, note 7, p. 449</ref> The Old English variants ''berg'' and ''beorg'' mean \"hill\" or \"mountain\".<ref>{{WR|3|VII}}, Notes, note 9, p. 356</ref>\n\nOn an unfinished sketch, Tolkien has written the names ''Stanburg'' ([[Old English]]) and ''Steinborg'' ([[Old Norse]]) both meaning \"Stone City\".<ref>{{HM|PT}}, #27</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nMinas Tirith's most obvious historical parallel is the capital of the Byzantine Empire, Byzantium or Constantinople. Founded by the Roman emperor Constantine, Constantinople would eventually be one of the largest cities of its day and be a fortress under constant attack by its enemies. Similarly, Minas Tirith would become the chief fortification of Gondor in the latter days of its decline.\n\nLike Minas Tirith, the Byzantine capital Constantinople sat near a strategic waterway (the Anduin to the Bay of Tolfalas in the case of Minas Tirith, the Bosporus Strait which divides the Mediterranean and Black Seas in the case of Constantinople) and was protected by massive walls that were virtually impregnable until the rise of effective gunpowder weapons in the real-world 15th century.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 570</ref>\n\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] summarized the story of ''The Silmarillion'' and of ''The Lord of the Rings'' in a long [[letter to Milton Waldman]], that was probably written in late 1951.<ref name=\"L131\">{{L|131}}</ref> In this letter he stated that in the Third Age Gondor rises to a peak of power and then \"fades slowly to decayed Middle-Age, a kind of proud, venerable, but increasingly impotent Byzantium\"<ref name=\"L131\"/> and that the story in Book Five of '' The Lord of the Rings'' comes to the \"half-ruinous Byzantine City of Minas Tirith\"<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 746</ref>.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Minas Tirith in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Return of the King (1980 film) - Minas Tirith.png|Minas Tirith in [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]\nFile:War in Middle Earth - Minas Tirith.gif|Minas Tirith in ''[[J.R.R.

Tolkien's War in Middle Earth]]'':'''\n:Minas Tirith is one of the many battlefields in this game. The city is brown, unlike the books in which it is white. \n\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''\n:The city appears briefly when Gandalf goes there to discern the identity of [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]'s [[The One Ring|One Ring]].\n\n'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''\n:Minas Tirith can be seen in the distance for a few seconds when [[Faramir]] takes [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] and [[Gollum]] to [[Osgiliath]].\n\n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''\n:Tolkien's description of the physical layout of Minas Tirith is mostly adhered to in the film, although certain artistic liberties are taken, such as the Tower of Ecthelion being separate from the building which contains the throne room. Despite the description of Minas Tirith's [[Othram]] as a black, indestructible wall, Jackson depicted all of the walls as white, which crumble quickly under attack from Mordor's catapults. The city is also closer to the mountain than in Tolkien's description and sketches. In the film, the city is within clear sight of the mountains surrounding Mordor and the fires of [[Mount Doom]] - so much so, that in at least one night scene the light of Minas Morgul shines on the faces of viewers from the city walls.  However, in the books, the mountains were far enough away that from the city they looked like a low dark shadow over the land far away.\n\n:According to the \"Making Of\" featurettes on the Extended Edition DVDs, the appearance and structure of the city was based upon [[Wikipedia:Mont Saint-Michel|Mont Saint-Michel]], France.\n\n:Portions of Minas Tirith were constructed as full-scale sets (built on the foundations of the disassembled [[Helm's Deep]] set), and the whole city as a highly detailed \"[[bigature]]\" by [[Weta Workshop]] combined with a detailed three-dimensional digital model, along with the whole of its surrounding environment. \n\n'''2015: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n: Several different versions of the city exist in-game, separated chronologically: under the [[Dawnless Day]], during the [[Siege of Gondor]], after the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] and during the Great Wedding of [[Aragorn]] and [[Arwen]] at [[Mid-year's Day]]. Each version is explorable and has a different set of quests. The Seven Tiers of the city have been given names: Worker's Tier, Soldier's Tier, Craftsmen's Tier, Player's Tier, Sages' Tier, Master's Tier and the Citadel. Large statues of every past King and Ruling Steward are placed across the city.\n\n{{references|note}}\n\n{{FellowshipRoute}}\n\n[[Category:Minas Tirith]]\n\n[[de:Minas Tirith (Gondor)]]\n[[fi:Minas Tirith]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/villes tours et forteresses/gondor/minas tirith]]"}}}
