Rescue the Princess of Cardolan's stolen tiara and help break up the complex smuggling ring. \n\nTharbad was founded in the Second Age by Tar-Aldarion as an inland port for his fleet to use while exploring the interior of Middle-earth... Its broad avenues, public parks and well laid out streets were the envy of other northern cities, for Tharbad was built by the Numenorians at the height of their power. However the years have not been kind to Tharbad... Although much grandeur remains, most sections of the city have fallen into decay.\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:MERP]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
