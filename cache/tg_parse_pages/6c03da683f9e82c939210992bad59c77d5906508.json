She travelled into the southern lands of [[Middle-earth]] and became lost in the [[White Mountains]] about {{TA|1981}}.\n\n==History==\nNimrodel had lived in Lothlórien since well before the [[Sindar]] and [[Noldor]] came. She was unhappy with the newcomers, as she thought they would bring the turmoils of [[Middle-earth]] to the golden forest. She lived separately near [[Nimrodel (river)|the river that would later bear her name]], and spoke only her native tongue.\n\nThe only good thing she saw in Lórien was the Sinda [[Amroth]], the King of the wood. She loved him, and he her, but refused to marry him. After the [[Durin's Bane|Balrog]] awoke in nearby [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] in {{TA|1980}}, Nimrodel grew even uneasier in Lórien. She fled, and made her way to the edge of [[Fangorn Forest]], but could not enter it.\n\nAmroth found her, and promised her peace. Together they would travel to [[Edhellond]], the port city in [[Belfalas]], and thence set sail to the [[Undying Lands]]. They were accompanied by a small staff of [[Silvan Elves]], including [[Mithrellas]]. All went well until they reached the [[White Mountains]]. The group became separated, and Amroth reached Edhellond well before the others. He decided to wait for his love aboard their ship.\n\nWhen a storm broke loose and swept the ship out of port, Amroth leaped overboard, hoping to swim back to shore. But he was quickly taken by [[Belegaer]]'s strong currents and drowned.\n\nNimrodel, in the meantime, had settled for a while at the river [[Gilrain]], which reminded her of her home. She sat by the starlit stream and fell in a long deep sleep. After she woke, she journeyed further, but found no ship in [[Edhellond]], and Amroth was long gone. Whatever she did after was lost to time.\n\n==Etymology==\nNimrodel means \"Lady of the White Grotto\".<ref name=\"UT\">{{UT|Index}}</ref>\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| AMD | | | | | |AMD=[[Amdír]]<br /><small>''d. {{SA|3434}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| |!| | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| AMR |~| NIM | |AMR=[[Amroth]]<br /><small>''d. {{TA|1981}}''</small>|NIM='''NIMRODEL'''<br/><small>''fl. {{TA|1981}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nBefore settling on ''Nimrodel'', other names considered for this character were '''''Linglorel''''', '''''Inglorel''''', '''''Nimladel''''', and '''''Nimlorel'''''.<ref>{{TI|XII}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Nimrodel.jpg|thumb|150px|Nimrodel in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2015: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n: Nimrodel was put into her deep sleep by the River-maiden of [[Gilrain]] and had slept for many seasons before she awoke. After learning the fate of her beloved [[Amroth]], Nimrodel mourned him ever, never venturing far from the Bay in which he was lost and never taking off her mourning veil. Forgoing her name of old, she became known as '''Dorthaneth''' and eventually became the leader of \"Avorrim\", a small elven community lingering near and keeping watch over the now-abandoned [[Edhellond]]. In the years before the [[War of the Ring]] she visited [[Dol Amroth]] and became a close friend of [[Lothíriel]], daughter of Prince [[Imrahil]]. After the War, Queen [[Arwen]] helps Dorthaneth to deal with her grief, causing her to lift her veil and become Nimrodel once again.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lay of Nimrodel]]\n* [[:Category:Images of Nimrodel|Images of Nimrodel]]\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Silvan Elves]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[de:Nimrodel (Elbe)]]\n[[fi:Nimrodel (haltia)]]"}}}
