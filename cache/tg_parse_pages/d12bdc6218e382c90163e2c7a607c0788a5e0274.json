His distant ancestor was King [[Vidugavia]].<ref>{{UT|8e}}, Note 5</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|1851}},<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1851 of the Third Age</ref> a tribe of [[Easterlings]] called the [[Wainriders]] began invading from the [[East]].

The Wainriders then overran Rhovanion and enslaved its people.<ref name=\"Cirion\"/>\n\nMarhari's son [[Marhwini]] led a group of refugees west to the [[Vales of Anduin]]. They would become the Éothéod, the ancestors of the mighty [[Riders of Rohan]].<ref name=\"Cirion\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n[[Christopher Tolkien]] suggests that the name ''Marhari'' is \"[[Gothic]] in form\" and that it contains the Gothic element ''marh'' (\"horse\"), which corresponds to [[Old English]] ''mearh'' (\"horse\") whose plural is ''mearas''.<ref>{{UT|8e}}, Note 6</ref>\n\n[[David Salo]] and [[Arden R. Smith]] suggest that the name is early [[Old English]] in form.<ref>[[David Salo]], Re: Digest: Radagast etc., e-mail to the Tolkien Language List (19.22), 10 July 1996, http://tolklang.quettar.org/messages/Vol19/19.22; Re: Digest: More Radagast etc., e-mail to the Tolkien Language List (19.36), 16 July 1996, http://tolklang.quettar.org/messages/Vol19/19.36; and Re: Gothic/Old English and pseudo-Latinized forms of same, e-mail to the Tolkien Language List (19.46), 18 July 1996, http://tolklang.quettar.org/messages/Vol19/19.46</ref><ref>[[Arden R.

[[Tom Shippey]] suggests that it means \"horse army\" and that it is not Gothic, but in a hypothetic reconstructed language, in proto-germanic.<ref>Didier Salamon & David Giraudeau, Le Livre de la Marche, 2006, p. 159</ref>\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | VID |VID=[[Vidugavia]]<br/><small>''fl. {{TA|1250|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree | |:| |}}\n{{familytree | |:| |}}\n{{familytree | MAR |MAR='''MARHARI'''<br/><small>''d. {{TA|1856|n}}''†</small>}}\n{{familytree | |!| |}}\n{{familytree | MAN |MAN=[[Marhwini]]<br/><small>''fl. {{TA|1856|n}} - {{TA|1899|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree | |!| |}}\n{{familytree | FOR |FOR=[[Forthwini]]<br/><small>''fl. {{TA|1944|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Gothic names]]\n[[Category:Northmen]]\n[[Category:Rulers in Middle-earth]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[de:Marhari]]\n[[fi:Marhari]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/hommes/3a/hommes du nord/marhari]]"}}}
