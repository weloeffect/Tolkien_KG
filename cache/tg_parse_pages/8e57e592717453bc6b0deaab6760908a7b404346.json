The [[Belegaer]] broke through the [[Ered Lómin]] and ended in the [[Cirith Ninniach]].

Tolkien|Tolkien]], ''Drengist'' is glossed as the [[Elvish]] equivalent of [[Old English]] ''Nearufléot''. The latter name is said by [[Christopher Tolkien]] to consist of ''[[Wiktionary:nearu|nearu]]'' (\"narrow\") + ''[[Wiktionary:fleet#English|fléot]]'' (\"arm of the sea, estuary, firth\").<ref>{{SM|QA1}}, p. 210</ref> The Elvish etymology of the name ''Drengist'' itself, however, appears to have been nowhere explained by Tolkien.<!-- Here could follow referenced suggestion(s) on how to interpret the Elvish name, I would suggest (User:Morgan) -->\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Bays]]\n[[Category:Beleriand]]\n[[Category:Noldorin locations]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[de:Drengist]]\n[[fr:encyclo:geographie:eaux:beleriand:drengist]]\n[[fi:Drengist]]"}}}
