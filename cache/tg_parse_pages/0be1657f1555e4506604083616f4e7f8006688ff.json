He refused, and in response the Dark Lord cursed his kin and imprisoned him on [[Thangorodrim]].

They were pursued to the ford of [[Brithiach]] and were saved by the Vala [[Ulmo]] who caused a mist to rise and the two escaped into [[Dimbar]]. From there, [[Eagles]] flew them to the hidden city [[Gondolin]]. King [[Turgon]] welcomed the brothers, remembering their grandfather Hador who was an [[Elf-friend]] as well as the words of Ulmo who told him to deal kindly to the House of Hador. Húrin remained with Turgon for a time until he and his brother wished to return to their people. Turgon was reluctant to let the brothers leave but the king granted their wish and the brothers swore oaths of secrecy.<ref>{{CH|1}}, pp. 35-7</ref> They returned to Dor-lómin sometime before {{FA|462|n}}.\n\n===Lord of Dor-lómin===\n[[File:Steamey - Hurin.jpg|thumb|left|''Húrin'' by [[:Category:Images by Steamey|Steamey]]]]\nIn {{FA|462}},<ref>{{GA|170}}, pp. 59-60</ref> orcs [[Assaults on Hithlum|invaded]] Hithlum and Galdor was slain defending the fortress of [[Eithel Sirion]]. Húrin who had newly come to manhood took command and drove off the Orcs. He returned to rule as the third [[Lord of Dor-lómin]]. Two years later he married [[Morwen|Morwen Eledhwen]] of the [[House of Bëor]].<ref name=\"TS18\" /> Their son Túrin was born shortly thereafter, followed by a daughter, [[Urwen]]. Urwen, better known as ''[[Lalaith]]'' (\"Laughter\"), died of the plague when she was three.\n\nIn {{FA|472|n}}, the alliance known as [[Union of Maedhros]] led Elves, Dwarves, and Men to assault Angband. Húrin led his folk to join the host led by the High King [[Fingon]]. In the battle, later named the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] or Battle of Unnumbered Tears, the Union were defeated by the hosts of Morgoth. Many Elves and Men perished, including Fingon who was slain by a [[Balrogs|Balrog]]. With their liege lord slain and facing a rout, Húrin and Huor convinced Turgon to withdraw and keep the secret of Gondolin. To defend his escape, the Men of Dor-lómin formed a rearguard near the [[Pass of Sirion]] and held it giving as much time for Turgon to gather the remainder of Fingon's people and the host of Gondolin to escape. The location of Gondolin remained secret but for the Men of the Dor-lómin this was their last stand for they would not forsake the Northlands and were slaughtered by the hosts of Morgoth. By the [[Fen of Serech]], Huor was slain by an arrow through the eye, but Húrin remained steadfast crying ''[[Aurë entuluva!]]''([[Sindarin|S]]) for each foe he slew with his axe, seventy times in all. He fought until he was buried under the weight of bodies of his enemies, then [[Gothmog]] bound him and dragged him towards Angband.<ref>{{S|20}}</ref>\n\n===The Curse of Morgoth===\n[[File:Alan Lee - The Words of Húrin and Morgoth.jpg|thumb|right|''The Words of Húrin and Morgoth'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]\nHúrin was brought before Morgoth, for he had learnt from his spies that Húrin was friends with Turgon, and was tortured for the secret of Gondolin's location. When he would not break, Morgoth cursed him and all his kin. The Dark Lord then chained Húrin to a chair high on the slopes of [[Thangorodrim]] where, through Morgoth's sorcery, he could watch the tragedies that would befall his family.<ref>{{CH|3}}, pp. 62-5</ref> However Morgoth concealed much of Túrin's deeds and what Húrin saw was contorted, lies mixed with the truth.\n{{blockquote|'But upon all whom you love my thought shall weigh as a cloud of Doom, and it shall bring them down into darkness and despair. Wherever they go, evil shall arise. Whenever they speak, their words shall bring ill counsel. Whatsoever they do shall turn against them. They shall die without hope, cursing both life and death.'|''[[The Children of Húrin]]'', [[The Words of Húrin and Morgoth]]}}\nFor 28 years,<ref name=\"TS22\" /> Húrin watched the curse come upon Túrin and [[Nienor]], his daughter born shortly after his capture, and to those that they encounter. For instance Túrin's actions led to the [[Fall of Nargothrond|destruction]] of [[Nargothrond]], one of the last kingdoms of the Noldor. Now only Gondolin remained.\n\n===Wanderings===\nAfter the death of his children Morgoth released Húrin, where he hoped he could further his malice. The broken man first returned to Hithlum, which was now ruled by [[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterlings]]. Finding none of his kin, he travelled with outlaws to the mountains of [[Echoriath]], searching for the entrance to Gondolin. At first Turgon refused him, but later recanted and sent Eagles to bring him to Gondolin. Húrin had already left for the Forest of Brethil, but Morgoth's curse had already ensnared Gondolin, for the Dark Lord's spies now knew the general location of the [[Gondolin|Hidden Kingdom]].<ref name=\"TS22\" />\n\nIn the Forest of Brethil he found the graves of his children. His wife, Morwen, was there and she died shortly after. After burying his wife, Húrin was taken by march-wardens to the settlement of [[Ephel Brandir]], the home of the [[People of Haleth]], with whom Túrin lived the last years of his life. Angry and grieving, he turned the People of Haleth against one another and ruined Ephel Brandir.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, pp. 291-4</ref>\n[[Image:Ted Nasmith - Húrin Finds Morwen.jpg|thumb|right|''Húrin Finds Morwen'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nHúrin continued on to the ruins of Nargothrond, where he found the [[Petty-dwarves|Petty-dwarf]] [[Mîm]]. The petty-dwarf had betrayed Túrin years ago and in revenge Húrin slaughtered him. Mîm had claimed the treasure of Nargothrond, but Húrin recovered the [[Nauglamír]] and journeyed eastwards.<ref name=\"TS22\" />\n\nHúrin reached the [[Meres of Twilight]] and was taken by the Elves who guarded the western borders of [[Doriath]] in {{FA|502}}.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, p. 258</ref> He was allowed to enter [[Menegroth]], where in anger he threw the Nauglamír before King [[Thingol]] and 'thanked' him for aiding his son. Thingol's wife, [[Melian]], finally pierced through Húrin's madness and grief revealing the truth that Morgoth hid. Shamed by his actions, he picked up the Nauglamír to give to the king as a gift and memorial, then he left Menegroth no longer a thrall of Morgoth.<ref name=\"TS22\" />\n\nAfter leaving Menegroth, it is said Húrin, \"bereft of all purpose and desire\", cast himself into the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]].<ref name=\"TS22\" /><ref>{{SM|Q14}}, p. 96: \"''… it is not said that ''[Húrin]'' found ''[Morwen]'' ever upon the earth; and some have said that he cast himself at last into the western sea…''\"</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nIt could be argued, that Húrin partly sowed the seeds of the destruction of [[ruin of Doriath|Doriath]] and [[fall of Gondolin|Gondolin]] or escalated it. Furthermore Húrin's presence in Brethil led to the extinction of the [[House of Haleth]].<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, p. 297</ref>\n\nHis life, and the lives of his children would become known as the ''[[Narn i Chîn Húrin (tale)|Narn i Chîn Húrin]]'', \"The Tale of the Children of Húrin\".
