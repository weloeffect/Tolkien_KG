The calendar features nine illustrations by [[Karolina Stopa]], [[Małgorzata Pudlik]], Gildor Inglorion, and [[Ryszard Derdziński]].\n\nFrom Ryszard Derdziński's website:\n:Its full title is Elvish Linguistic Calendar because it contains 8 short texts in Quenya with commentaries and the 'reconstructed words' dictionaries and seasonal Quenya glossaries...All the dates in the Middle-earth calendars are given in the Fëanorian numerals. The calendar contains the Foreword explaining the Elvish numerals and all the calendar arrangements and the Note on the Calculations by Boris Shapiro. It can be a nice item in your Tolkien collection or calendar collection.\n\nThe Calendar treats the Anno Domini/Common Era, as the \"[[Seventh Age]]\", according to Boris Shapiro's interpretation of [[Letter 211]] that \"we are actually at the end of the Sixth Age, or in the Seventh\": Shapiro preferred to choose the Seventh, with the birth of Christ as an event important enough to signal its beginning, \"sure that Tolkien would agree\".<ref>{{webcite|author=Boris Shapiro|articleurl=https://www.elvish.org/gwaith/calendars.htm|articlename=The Calendars of Imladris, Gondor and the Shire and their adaptation for Gregorian reckoning|website=|accessed=8 August 2023}}</ref> Interestingly, [[2021|twenty years later]], a later note of Tolkien was published about [[1960]] being \"1960 of the Seventh Age\", indicating that the Christian reckoning is the Seventh Age.<ref>{{NM|P1vi}}, p. 39</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://home.agh.edu.pl/~evermind/muzyka1/calendar_2001.zip Download the calendar]\n\n{{title|italics}}\n\n[[Category:Calendars (real-world)|2001, Elvish]]\n[[Category:Linguistic books]]"}}}
