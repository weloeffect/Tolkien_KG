The Goblin Scribe was invented by [[Warner Bros.]] for [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]], where he was portrayed by [[Kiran Shah]] using motion-capture.<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903624/characters/nm0787449|articlename=The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012) - Kiran Shah: Goblin Scribe|website=[http://www.imdb.com/ IMDb]|accessed=}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe Goblin Scribe was an offspring of the Great Goblin, but was never given any proper recognition by him because his mother was someone who his father would like to forget.<ref>[[Daniel Falconer]], ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey: Chronicles: Art & Design]]'', \"...And Under Hill\", p. 182</ref> Due to the fact that he was born tiny with malformed legs and long fingernails, he was not a fighter and therefore served as a scribe, messenger, and possibly translator for his father. He took advantage of his long fingernails to take notes and write messages on parchment, moving around [[Goblin-town]] on a pulley with a seat attached to it.\n\nWhen the Great Goblin received the notice of [[Azog|Azog's]] bounty on [[Thorin|Thorin's]] head, the Goblin Scribe possibly translated the bounty for his father from the [[Black Speech]] to [[Westron]].\n\nDuring the [[Quest of Erebor]], when [[Thorin and Company|Thorin and his Company]] were captured at the [[Front Porch]] and brought before the Great Goblin, the Goblin Scribe was given orders by his father to write and send a letter, possibly in Black Speech, to inform the Pale Orc that Thorin and his Company were in Goblin-town.\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| GRE | |GRE=[[Great Goblin]]<br /><small>''d. {{TA|2941}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| |!| | |}}\n{{familytree| GOB | |GOB='''GOBLIN SCRIBE'''<br /><small>''b.
