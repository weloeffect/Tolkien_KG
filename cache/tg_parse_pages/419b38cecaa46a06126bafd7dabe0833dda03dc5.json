Reinforced by the fresh forces from Númenor the Elves of Lindon and the Númenoreans defeated the forces of Sauron at the river Lhûn and drove them back to the south-east. The forces of Sauron were further decimated in a battle at the [[Sarn Ford]] at the river [[Baranduin]].<ref name=Concerning/>\n\nSauron was driven further to the south-east to [[Tharbad]] at the crossings of the river [[Gwathló]] where he was reinforced by more of his troops that had come at his orders from the south-east. But Ciryatur had sent a strong force to the small Númenórean harbour of [[Vinyalondë]]<ref>{{UT|6d}}</ref> at the mouth of the [[Gwathló]]. This second Númenórean force appeared in the rear of Sauron's army at the Gwathló. In the ensuing [[Battle of the Gwathló]], the host of Sauron was completely routed and Sauron himself barely escaped. A final battle in eastern [[Calenardhon]] stripped Sauron of all but a tiny bodyguard. The Dark Lord retreated into [[Mordor]] and plotted vengeance upon the Númenóreans.<ref name=Concerning/>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Ciryatur'' is a [[Quenya]] name. Its meaning is not glossed, but Paul Strack suggests that it means \"Ship Master\", being a compound of ''[[cirya]]'' (\"ship\") + suffix ''[[tur]]'' (\"master\")<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-3211461155.html|articlename=Q. ''Ciryatur'' m.|website=Eldamo|accessed=28 July 2022}}</ref> — an appropriate name for an admiral. It is in fact possible that this is the name of his position rather than his real name (cf. [[Ohtar]]).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Tar-Ciryatan]]: The heir of Tar-Minastir, and a mariner who was alive and in adulthood contemporaneously with the deeds of Ciryatur during the War of Elves and Sauron. \n\n{{References|n}}\n[[Category:Mariners]]\n[[Category:Númenóreans]]\n[[Category:Quenya names]]\n[[Category:Second Age characters]]\n\n[[de:Ciryatur]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/hommes/2a/numenoreens/ciryatur]]\n[[fi:Ciryatur]]"}}}
