However, like ''The Orgog'', it also has \"blue mountains and an orange sun\". The painting is dedicated to John. In September [[1936]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] accidentally tore it up, though Tolkien repaired it.<ref name=AI/>\n\nOn [[22 June]] [[2025]], [[Jason Fisher]] mentioned on his blog that he had been told that ''The Orgog'' \"really isn’t in a state suitable for publication\" in a private correspondence.<ref name=lingwe>{{webcite|author=[[Jason Fisher]]|articleurl=https://lingwe.blogspot.com/2025/06/the-ulsterior-motive-and-other.html?m=1|articlename=“The Ulsterior Motive” and other unpublished writings of Tolkien|dated=22 June 2025|website=Lingwe|accessed=23 June 2025}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe meaning of \"orgog\", and if the word has any connection to one of Tolkien's invented [[:Category:Languages|languages]], is unknown. It was speculated by Jason Fisher on his blog that the word may{{blockquote|relate to “[[Ogres|ogre]]”, perhaps connected with [[Hilary Tolkien]]’s (and Ronald’s) childhood tales of black and white ogres. Or there is the character of Orgoglio from Edmund Spenser’s ''The Faerie Queene''. That work was more to Lewis’s taste than Tolkien’s, but you never know. In that work, Orgoglio is a monster who attacks Redcross Knight in Book One, Canto VII. The name, interestingly enough, is Italian for “pride”, from Vulgar Latin *''orgollium'', in turn from Proto-West Germanic *''urgollju'' “pride, arrogance”.<ref name=lingwe/>}}\n\n== Inspiration ==\nAlthough it might be a mere coincidence, the name ''Orgog'' is reminiscent of [[Wikipedia:Orgoglio|Orgoglio]], the name of a giant appearing in Book I of [[Wikipedia:Edmund Spenser|Edmund Spenser's]] ''[[Wikipedia:The Faerie Queene|The Faerie Queene]]''.<ref group=\"note\">For a mention of Orgoglio in the context of Tolkien's writings, cf. Jonathan Evans, \"Pride\" in [[Michael D.C. Drout]] (ed.), ''[[J.R.R.
