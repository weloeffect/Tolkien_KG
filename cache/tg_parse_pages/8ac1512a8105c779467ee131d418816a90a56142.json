After some years of wandering they settled down in [[Dunland]]. Among these Dwarves were [[Thrór]], formerly the [[King under the Mountain]], his son [[Thráin|Thráin II]], and his grandson [[Thorin II]].<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref><ref name=\"Durin\">{{App|Durin}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Prelude===\nThrór fell into despair after living many years in poverty, or perhaps the [[Rings of Power|Ring]] he wore was ultimately working evil upon its bearer.<ref name=\"Durin\"/> Whatever the case, he decided to leave his people in {{TA|2790|n}}<ref name=\"TA\"/> to seek out and look upon the ancestral halls of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]]. Accompanied by his friend [[Nár]], they crossed the [[Redhorn Pass]] and came down to the [[Great Gates|East-gate of Moria]] where Thrór took it upon himself to enter alone, despite the warnings of Nár who stayed behind in the dale. \n\nThrór was caught and slain by [[Azog]] the [[Orcs|Orc]]-chieftain of Moria, and after a few days Thrór's head was branded with Azog's name and the corpse was thrown out of the gate where it was found by Nár. He was left alive to serve as a messenger to the Dwarves that Azog now claimed to be the King of Moria, and to stay away.\n\nWhen Nár returned to the king's son Thráin, he told him of his [[Murder of Thrór|father's murder]] and the Orc's warning. For seven days without eating or sleeping the new king sat, until he stood and cried \"This cannot be borne!\"<ref name=\"Durin\"/>\n\nFrom 2790 to {{TA|2793|n}},<ref name=\"TA\"/> the [[Longbeards]] responded to this tragedy by [[Mustering of the Dwarves|gathering an army]], and calling on the other Houses of the Dwarves for war.\n\n===Early Conflicts===\nIn 2793, the Dwarven host was ready, and departed for war; assailing and sacking all the Orc-holds they could find from [[Gundabad|Mount Gundabad]] in the north, to the [[Gladden River|Gladden]] in the south one by one. \n\nLittle is actually known about the six year-long war; however, it is known that most of it was fought underground, in the great mines and tunnels of the Misty Mountains, where Dwarves excelled in combat. Both sides fought without mercy, and the Dwarves are said to have acted as cruelly as the Orcs they battled.<ref name=\"Durin\"/>\n\n===Battle of Azanulbizar===\n{{main|Battle of Azanulbizar}}\nThe war came to its climax in {{TA|2799|n}}<ref name=\"TA\"/> when the final battle was fought in the Dimrill Dale below the East-gate of [[Moria]], the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]], the same gate the Fellowship of the Ring would exit 220 years later. The Dwarves gained victory in this notoriously bloody encounter when reinforcements arrived late on the scene from the [[Iron Hills]]. Azog was slain by [[Dáin Ironfoot]].  \n\nIn its aftermath, King Thráin wanted to enter reclaim the city, but the Dwarves not of Durin's folk refused, saying that the city was not their Fathers' House; they had honored Thrór's memory by fighting and that was enough. [[Dáin Ironfoot]] also warned the king that [[Durin's Bane]] still dwelt within Khazad-dûm.<ref name=\"Durin\"/>\n\n===Aftermath===\nThe war was very costly for the Dwarves and Orcs: nearly half of those involved in the final battle were killed. [[Náin (son of Grór)|Náin]], [[Frerin]], and [[Fundin]] were among the more notable casualties. Thráin II himself lost an eye and gained a limp, and Thorin was wounded when his shield broke and he had to use an oak branch to defend himself-hence the epithet \"[[Oakenshield]]\".<ref name=\"Durin\"/>\n\nThe Orcs suffered irreparable damage to their numbers by war's end; ten thousand alone were killed in the Dimrill Dale.\nThose that survived the final battle fled south, seeking refuge in the [[White Mountains]], where they troubled the [[Rohirrim]] for two generations.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref> In {{TA|2851}}<ref name=\"TA\"/> King [[Walda]] was slain with all his companions by Orcs near [[Dunharrow]].  His son [[Folca]] hunted down and eliminated the last Orc-hold in the White Mountains.<ref>{{App|Mark}}, ''Second Line''</ref>\n\nAs a result of such losses, the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] virtually disappeared as a threat to [[Eriador]] and  [[Rhovanion|Wilderland]]. One and a half centuries later the Orcs of the North were recovering, but their numbers were permanently depleted to severely low levels in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Five Armies]] in {{TA|2941|n}}.<ref name=\"TA\"/> It was here that [[Bolg]] son of Azog tried to avenge his father and the [[Great Goblin]], but in his failure, three fourths of his people were killed.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2020: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The conflict is referred to as the \"''Sixth'' War of Dwarves and Orcs\". A \"Fifth War of the Dwarves and Orcs\" is mentioned as having been triggered by the slaying of King [[Thorin I]] by Orcs in the [[Grey Mountains]]. The alliance of multiple Houses is known as the \"Gabil'akkâ, the Unified Army of Dwarves\", and the host assembled by Thráin in particular as the \"Haban'akkâ\".\n\n:The Battle of Azanulbizar is portrayed in an extended flashback sequence in which the player assumes the role of \"Hermáth Stormhammer\", a close friend of [[Dáin Ironfoot]] who composed a detailed account of the war on the King's request. All seven of the Dwarven Houses, including their kings, participate in the conflict, despite some coming from very far to the East and not having any contact with the Longbeards since the fall of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]].\n\n:A potential seventh war, known at the time as the \"War of Three Peaks\", begins after the downfall of [[Sauron]] in [[Third Age 3019]], when King [[Thorin Stonehelm]]'s son Prince Durin assembles a dwarven host to reclaim [[Gundabad]].\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Sack of Erebor]]\n\n{{references}}\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq\n| prev=[[Long Winter]]\n| list=Major events of [[Middle-earth]]\n| dates={{TA|2793}} - {{TA|2799}}\n| next=[[Fell Winter (Third Age)|Fell Winter]]\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n[[Category:Conflicts of the Third Age]]\n[[Category:Wars]]\n[[fr:encyclo/evenements/3a/guerres/guerre des nains et des orques]]\n[[fi:Kääpiöiden ja örkkien sota]]"}}}
