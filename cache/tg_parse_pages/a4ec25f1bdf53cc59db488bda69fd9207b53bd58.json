Under the direction of Sir Peter Jackson, their extraordinary efforts to adapt J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit generated almost 24 hours of cinematic wonder, and transported audiences to a world of astonishing beauty and power.\nRichly illustrated with thousands of film frames, concept art and behind-the-scenes imagery, many previously unseen, Middle-earth: From Script to Screen follows in the footsteps of the Fellowship of the Ring and the Company of Thorin Oakenshield, visiting the realms and landscapes of Middle-earth and uncovering their secrets. Accompanying this stunning gallery, cast and crew reflect upon their experiences, share brand-new stories and insights into how the wildernesses and soundstages of New Zealand were transformed into a magical world of hobbits, Dwarves and Elves, resulting in one of the most spectacular achievements in cinematic history.\nWith foreword by Sir Peter Jackson and additional writing by K.M. Rice; illustrated with final film imagery, behind-the-scenes pictures and conceptual artwork, including places not seen in the final films, this monumental compilation offers unique and far-reaching insights into the creation of the world we know and love as Middle-earth.}}\n\n{{title|italics}}\n\n{{lordoftheringsfilms}}\n{{hobbitfilms}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Middle-earth from Script to Screen}}\n[[Category:The Hobbit (film series) tie-in books]]\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings (film series) tie-in books]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
