Yet, it is implied that they were a group of Men from [[Bree-land]] that broke their ties with the rest of the [[free peoples]]. It is not stated what motivated them to do so.\n\nThe group was led by William Skunkwood who allied it with the forces of Angmar. After William's death, [[Éogan]] took over leadership of the group. He too was slain. After his death the Blackwolds broke apart and severed their ties with Angmar.\n\n==History==\nThe Blackwolds helped [[Nazgûl|the Nine]] find the [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] who is carrying [[the One Ring]]. The [[Nazgûl]] did not inform them why they were looking for the Hobbit nor did they give a description of the Hobbit, only that the last name was [[Baggins Family|Baggins]]. They managed to capture [[Mundo Sackville-Baggins]] while he was staying at [[Archet]]. Just when they were attempting to transport him away for questioning, the [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]] [[Amdir (Shadows of Angmar)|Amdir]] freed him. Mundo along with his friend [[Celandine Brandybuck]] managed to burn their camp as they escaped.<ref name=Stirrings>{{VGC|SAI}}</ref> \n\nThe Blackwolds regrouped and with the help of [[Calder Cob]] they planned a direct attack on the town of [[Archet]]. Along with [[Éogan]], the Blackwolds managed to set the town on fire. They captured Mundo again, but learned that he wasn't carrying the treasure they were looking for. They quickly retreated, but managed to destroy half of Archet in their assault.<ref name=Stirrings /> \n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Concepts from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings Online characters]]"}}}
