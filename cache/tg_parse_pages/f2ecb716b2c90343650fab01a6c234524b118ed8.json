This scene was not featured in the theatrical release of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''.\n==Synopsis==\n[[Aragorn]] looks into the [[Orthanc-stone]] and sees [[Sauron]]. A voice is heard saying ''\"silivren penna miriel\"''.<ref group=\"note\">These are lyrics from the song ''[[A Elbereth Gilthoniel]]'' and translate to \"''crystalline falls twinkling like jewels\"''</ref> Aragorn challenges Sauron by displaying the [[Andúril|reforged sword of Elendil]]. The Palantír then shows [[Arwen]] dying and Sauron begins to speak in black speech. Aragorn drops the Palantír and stumbled back. As he does the Evenstar necklace, the necklace given to him by Arwen, falls and shatters. Aragorn leads the [[Army of the West]] out of [[Minas Tirith]].\n==Differences==\n*In the books Aragorn looked in to the Palantír before he takes the [[Paths of the Dead]] rather than after the [[Last Debate]].<ref name=\"Company\">{{RK|Company}}, p. 780</ref>\n* Aragorn spoke no words to Sauron.<ref name=\"Company\" />\n*If Aragorn was shown a vision of Arwen he does not mention it. Instead he learned many things, among them being the coming of the [[Corsairs of Umbar]] which was what drove him to take the Paths of the Dead.<ref name=\"Company\" />\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King scenes|60]]\n{{references|notes}}\n__NOTOC__"}}}
