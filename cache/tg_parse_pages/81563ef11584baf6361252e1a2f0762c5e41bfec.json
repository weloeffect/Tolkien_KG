At least, [[Bilbo Baggins]] and the [[Dwarves]] found a boat kept on the eastern bank of the River, which they used to cross it on their journey to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. However, [[Bombur]] fell in the river and lost consciousness, and his companions had to pull him out and carry him for several days with ropes.<ref>{{H|Flies}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n\n'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''\n: The Enchanted River, said to be called Gûlduin or Gûlhir in Sindarin, is 100 miles long.<ref>{{ICE|2019}}</ref><ref>{{ICE|4002}}</ref>\n\n'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''\n:The Enchanted River appears only in the [[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (extended edition)|extended edition]].

They are forced to find another way past the river, which causes them to get lost in the forest.\n\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Enchanted River.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The Enchanted River flows under the repaired bridge in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2018: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Enchanted River was formerly called Lúthir (''Sindarin'': Flower River) by the Elves. After its corruption, the river's name was changed to Rhachló (''Sindarin'': Cursed River). The enchantment persists even after the downfall of [[Sauron]], when the rest of the [[Mirkwood]] forest is cleansed and becomes ''Eryn Lasgalen''. Entering the water - or even approaching it - puts a \"dreamy\" visual effect on the screen and causes the player's character to involuntary lie down, repeating every seconds after getting back up. The enchantment disappears when the waters are joined by those of the [[Forest River]].\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Rhovanion]]\n[[Category:Rivers]]"}}}
