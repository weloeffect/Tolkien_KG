And travelled northwards as Orc captains called [[Nereb]] and [[Dungalef]], with their company. [[Thû]] from [[Wizard's Isle]] spotted them, and brought them in, where he questioned them, suspecting a trick. \n\nThen comes one of the most descriptive paragraphs, of how Thû \"chanted a song of wizardry\", and how Felagund responded with \"a song of staying\".  They fought back and forth a battle of minds, until at last Felagund's power fell, and they returned to their own original forms.  Then how Thû placed them in his dungeons, and every now and then sent down a [[werewolves|werewolf]] to devour one of them, hoping another would name the errand they were on.  But \"none would yield, and none would tell\"."}}}
