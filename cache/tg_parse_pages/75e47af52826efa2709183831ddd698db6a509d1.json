Tolkien]] around the autumn of [[1931]].<ref name=RG/> The lecture deals with constructed languages in general, and the relation of a mythology to its language. Tolkien contrasts auxiliary languages (like Esperanto) with artistic languages constructed for aesthetic pleasure.<ref name=MC6>{{MC|6}}</ref>\n\nThe title (consisting of a phrase occurring in the lecture) was created by [[Christopher Tolkien]] for the publication of the lecture manuscript in ''[[The Monsters and the Critics]]''.<ref>{{MC|F}}</ref> Tolkien himself referred to the lecture as \"A Secret Vice\" in a letter.<ref>{{L|294}}</ref>\n\nIn [[2016]], it was published as a separate book ''[[A Secret Vice: Tolkien on Invented Languages]]'', edited by [[Dimitra Fimi]] and [[Andrew Higgins]]. The book provides an introduction and commentaries to the essay, as well as some previously unseen drafts and notes.\n\n==Summary==\nTolkien begins by briefly discussing Esperanto but states that the topic of his lecture rather concerns \"secret\" languages. As an example of such a language, he first recalls an incident where he overheard a man working on his own \"secret grammar\" while Tolkien was in the army in the [[World War I|First World War]]. He then continues by mentioning and analysing two constructed languages: the children's play-languages [[Animalic]] and [[Nevbosh]]. The next constructed language discussed is [[Naffarin]], a more advanced, private language \"partly overlapping the last stages of ''Nevbosh''\". Finally, Tolkien discusses the languages he created for his [[legendarium|mythology]] and gives examples of his [[Elvish]] poetry (with translations in English).<ref name=MC6/>\n\nIncluded in the lecture are:\n*a fragment in [[Nevbosh]]\n*a fragment in [[Naffarin]]\n*the poem ''[[Oilima Markirya]]'' (in [[Qenya]])<ref name=PE16>{{PE|16}}, p. 98</ref>\n*the poem ''[[Nieninque]]'' (in Qenya)<ref name=PE16/>\n*the poem ''[[Éarendel at the Helm]]'' (in Qenya)<ref name=PE16/>\n*a fragment in [[Noldorin]] (beginning with \"[[Dir avosaith a gwaew hinar]]\")<ref name=RG>{{CG|RG}}, pp. 882-3</ref>\n\n==External links==\n*\"[http://www.uib.no/People/hnohf/vice.htm Tolkien's Not-So-Secret Vice]\", essay by [[Helge Fauskanger]]\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Secret Vice, A}}\n[[Category:Chapters]]\n[[Category:Lectures by J.R.R.
