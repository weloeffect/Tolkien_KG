The full title is '''The GEST of BEREN son of BARAHIR and Lúthien the FAY called TINUVIEL the NIGHTINGALE or the LAY OF LEITHIAN Release from Bondage'''.\n==Development==\nTolkien stated in his [[J.R.R. Tolkien's diaries|diary]] that he started the Lay during the time of summer examinations of [[1925]] at the [[University of Leeds]]. Confirming this, the first recorded date of the writing of the Lay was at Line 557: [[August 23]], [[1925]].  The next date is two and a half years later, 27–8 March, [[1928]], at line 1161.  Over the next nine days he wrote fully 1769 lines, up to 2929. These dates are for the copying out of the manuscript, not for their writing, so Tolkien may have had many passages earlier before he put them together. In September [[1931]], he abandoned the Lay.<ref>{{LB|Leithian}}, pp. 150-151</ref> He sent it to [[C.S. Lewis]], who wrote back the following:\n{{blockquote|I sat up late last night and have read the ''Geste'' as far as to where Beren and his gnomish allies defeat the patrol of orcs above the sources of the [[Narog]] and disguise themselves in the ''rëaf'' [ [[Old English|OE]]: 'garments, weapons, taken from the slain'].  I can quite honestly say that it is ages since I have had an evening of such delight: and the personal interest of reading a friend's work had very little to do with it.  I should have enjoyed it just as well as if I'd picked it up in a bookshop, by an unknown author.  The two things that come out clearly are the sense of reality in the background and the mythical value: the essence of a myth being that it should have no taint of allegory to the maker and yet should suggest incipient allegories to the reader|The Lay of Leithian introduction}}\n\nLater he wrote a detailed criticism, which pretends to treat the Lay as if it were a historical document. Tolkien was influenced by Lewis' comments, and made several minor changes based on them.\n\nAfter the completion of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Tolkien began a new version of ''The Lay'', which [[Christopher Tolkien]] includes in the same book as ''[[The Lay of Leithian Recommenced]]''.\n\n==Contents==\n===Canto===\n* '''[[Lay of Leithian Canto I|Canto I]]''' - concerning [[Thingol|Elu Thingol]] and [[Doriath]]\n* '''[[Lay of Leithian Canto II|Canto II]]''' - concerning [[Barahir|Barahir the Bold]], the treachery of [[Gorlim]], his death, and [[Beren|Beren Erchamion]]'s vow for revenge\n* '''[[Lay of Leithian Canto III|Canto III]]''' - concerning the meeting of Beren and [[Lúthien|Lúthien Tinúviel]]\n* '''[[Lay of Leithian Canto IV|Canto IV]]''' - concerning Beren's capture and the bride-price of Lúthien as layed down by Thingol: a [[Silmarils|Silmaril]]\n* '''[[Lay of Leithian Canto V|Canto V]]''' - concerning Lúthien in Doriath and her escape\n* '''[[Lay of Leithian Canto VI|Canto VI]]''' - concerning Beren in [[Nargothrond]], with [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] and the scheming of [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]]\n* '''[[Lay of Leithian Canto VII|Canto VII]]''' - concerning the battle of minds between Finrod and [[Thû]], and the fall of Finrod\n* '''[[Lay of Leithian Canto VIII|Canto VIII]]''' - concerning Celegorm and Curufin's capture of Lúthien, and her meeting with [[Huan]]\n* '''[[Lay of Leithian Canto IX|Canto IX]]''' - concerning Huan's battle with Thû, the destruction of [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth|Wizard's Isle]], and the freeing of Beren\n* '''[[Lay of Leithian Canto X|Canto X]]''' - concerning the second parting of Beren and Lúthien and the battle with Celegorm and Curufin\n* '''[[Lay of Leithian Canto XI|Canto XI]]''' - concerning the reunion of Beren and Lúthien and the approach to [[Thangorodrim]]\n* '''[[Lay of Leithian Canto XII|Canto XII]]''' - concerning the battle of [[Fingolfin]] and [[Morgoth]] and the enchanting of [[Carcharoth]]\n* '''[[Lay of Leithian Canto XIII|Canto XIII]]''' - concerning Lúthien's dance before Morgoth, his enchantment, and the stealing of the Silmaril\n* '''[[Lay of Leithian Canto XIV|Canto XIV]]''' - concerning the flight of Beren and Lúthien and the rage of Carcharoth\n===Unwritten cantos===\n\n===Appendix: Commentary by C.S.
