Melian said that Beren was in the dungeons of [[Thû]], and Dairon refused to play any music. A second time Dairon betrayed her, this time out of love, to her father [[Thingol]], who placed her in a guarded treehouse. But by magic she grew out her hair and made a robe and rope of it \"a magic dress / that all was drenched in drowsiness\".  Lowering the rope she put to sleep her guards and escaped.\n\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Lúthien Escapes the Treehouse.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Lúthien escapes the Treehouse'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\n\n==Concerning the Canto==\nAfter Beren is gone, the forest falls into solemn silence:\n\n{{blockquote|So days drew on from the mournful day;<br>\nthe curse of silence no more lay<br>\non Doriath, though Dairon's flute<br>\nand Lúthien's singing both were mute.|vv. 1206-1209}}\n\nLúthien sings only quietly this medley of mourning:\n\n{{blockquote|'Endless roll the waters past!<br>\nTo this my love hath come at last,<br>\nenchanted waters pitiless,<br>\na heartache and a loneliness.'|vv. 1220-1223}}\n\nAfter learning from Melian of Beren's fate, she seeks comfort in Dairon, begging him to make her music to aid her heart.\n\n{{blockquote|On earth she cast her at his side.<br>\n'O Dairon, Dairon, my tears,' she cried,<br>\n'now pity for our old days' sake!<br>\nfor heart's despair, and for heart's dread<br>\nfor light gone dark and laughter dead!'|vv. 1262-1267}}\n\nBut \"for music dead there is no note\", replies Dairon, though he plays a wailing melody that causes all creatures, birds and elves, to forget their happiness. Though Lúthien entreats him then to come with her to seek Beren, he replies firmly\n\n{{blockquote|'Wherefore,' said he, 'should Dairon go<br>\ninto direst peril earth doth know<br>\nfor the sake of mortal who did steal<br>\nhis laughter and joy? No love I feel<br>\nfor Beren son of Barahir,<br>\nnor weep for him in dungeons drear,<br>\nwho in this wood have chains enow,<br>\nheavy and dark. But thee, I vow,<br>\nI will defend from perils fell<br>\nand deadly wandering into hell.'|vv. 1298-1307}}\n\nThis indeed does Dairon do, for he warns the King of Lúthien's apparent madness. Thingol \"in angry love and half in fear\" locks her up in a treehouse, not wanting to bind her in his caverns. Lúthien, though forgiving Dairon, pines for Beren.\n\n{{blockquote|Yet long the hours when she must sit<br>\nand see the sunbeams dance and flit<br>\nin beechen leaves, or watch the stars<br>\npeep on clear nights between the bars<br>\nof beechen branches. And one night<br>\njust ere the changing of the light<br>\na dream there came, from the Gods, maybe,<br>\nor Melian's magic. She dreamed that she<br>\nheard Beren's voice o'er hill and fell<br>\n'Tinúviel' call, 'Tinúviel.'<br>\nAnd her heart answered 'Let me be gone<br>\nto seek him no others think upon!'|vv. 1408-1419}}\n\nFollowing is a detailed description of her magic art to grow out her hair. Then she weaves them with a borrowed loom\n\n{{blockquote|...Of cloudy hair<br>\nshe wove a web like misty air<br>\nof moonless night, and thereof made<br>\na robe as fluttering-dark as shade<br>\nbeneath great trees, a magic dress<br>\nthat all was drenched with drowsiness.|vv. 1540-1545}}\n\nAnd finally as the sun goes down she causes the guards to fall asleep with the rope, and\n\n{{blockquote|Now clad as in a cloud she hung;<br>\nnow down her ropéd hair she swung<br>\nas light as squirrel, and away,<br>\naway, she danced, and who could say<br>\nwhat paths she took, whose elvish feet<br>\nno impress made a-dancing fleet?|vv. 1578-1583}}"}}}
