[[Elrond]] introduces them to [[Talagan Silvertongue]], lord of Edhelion. While the player is visiting it, it is about to be under attack by [[Skorgrím]] and the [[Dourhands]]. Elrond quickly teaches the player to fight, and when the Dourhands attack the player has to fight them off.<ref name=\"Refuge of Edhelion\"/> Together with Elrond and the Elf [[Dorongúr Whitethorn]] the player fights of the enemies. But when Skorgrím comes, Talagan fights him before the Library of Edhelion and, after bringing it down upon them, Talagan kills himself, and Skorgrím with him.<ref name=\"Skorgr%C3%ADm_Dourhand\">{{LOTROW|Skorgrím Dourhand|2025-08-13}}</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|3016}} Elrond has a dream about Edhelion and he sends his sons [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]] to investigate. They camp at Edhelion Watch, where a group of Elves have gathered that Elladan and Elrohir take as companions to investigate the dream, alongside the player. There is also a dwarf, visiting because there were some interesting findings in the Silver Deep mines not far away.<ref name=\"Edhelion_Watch\">{{LOTROW|Edhelion Watch|2025-08-13}}</ref> Dorongúr Whitethorn is also of that company and, together with the elf [[List of minor The Lord of the Rings Online characters in the Ered Luin#Dorollas|Dorollas]] he is attempting to reclaim the city of Edhelion, but it is infested with orcs.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings Online]], Introduction, ''Intro: Plague among the Trees''</ref>\n\nAfter the introduction quests, only a Lore-master named Isdi remains behind and Edhelion is deserted once again.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe survivors of the Fall of Edhelion fled to lower Ered Luin, settling at first in [[Gondamon]] at the midway point between [[Thorin's Hall]] and [[Kheledûl]]. This city they built themselves, but when they left for Duillond the Dwarves who came after them changed it to their liking.<ref name=\"Gondamon\">{{LOTROW|Gondamon|2025-08-13}}</ref>\n\nAfter they left Gondamon, desiring to go nearer to the sea, they built [[Duillond]] north of [[Celondim]] and there was great friendship between these peoples.<ref name=\"Gondamon\"/>\n\n==Descprition==\nEdhelion lies to the north of the [[Ered Luin]] in a valley. It was originally built to make elven wine and to gather wood for the construction of ships in [[Mithlond]], by ferrying it via the docks of [[Celondim]]. In the centre of the city stood the Library of Edhelion, with a great bridge leading to it. \n\n==Etymology==\n''Edhelion'' means \"Valley of Elves\", from ''[[edhel]]'' meaning \"elf\"<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, ''edhel''</ref> and ''ion'' meaning \"region between mountains\".<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p.43</ref><ref name=\"Edhelion\"/>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings Online locations]]"}}}
