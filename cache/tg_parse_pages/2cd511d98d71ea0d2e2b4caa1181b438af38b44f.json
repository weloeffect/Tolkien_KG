It was formed from two closely-pressed ranks presenting a barrier of shields, solidly enough to withstand the onslaught of their enemies. The thangail was designed to be flexible, and could bend at one or both of its ends to prevent being outflanked by enemies, even curling round to meet itself and so form an unbroken circle of shields.<ref name=Gladden>{{UT|Gladden}}</ref>\n\nThe only record of the thangail in actual use was by [[Isildur]], who ordered one drawn up when attacked by [[Orcs]] in the incident known to history as the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]].<ref name=Gladden/> However, there is reason to think that the formation originated with the [[Elves]], because it had an 'official' name in [[Quenya]].<ref name=Note16>{{UT|7a}}, note 16</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\n[[wikipedia:Shield wall|Shield walls]] were a common element of pre-gunpowder battlefield tactics, e.g. the ancient Greek [[wikipedia:Phalanx formation|phalanx]], Roman legionary [[wikipedia:Testudo formation|testudo formation]] and Scottish [[wikipedia:Sheltron|sheltron]].\n\n==Etymology==\n''thangail'' is a [[Sindarin]] name, which means \"shield-fence\". It is a compound of ''[[than]]'' (\"shield\") and ''[[cail]]'' (\"fence\").<ref name=Note16/>\n\nThe name of the same formation in [[Quenya]] was ''[[sandastan]]'', which means \"shield-barrier\". It is derived from primitive ''thanda'' (\"shield\") and ''stama'' (\"bar\", \"exclude\").<ref name=Note16/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dírnaith]]\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Tactical formations]]\n[[Category:Sindarin nouns]]\n[[de:Thangail]]\n[[fi:Thangail]]"}}}
