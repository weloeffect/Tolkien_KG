Tolkien]]\n\"'''A Part of the Shire'''\" is the title of the map that immediately follows the \"[[Prologue (The Lord of the Rings)|Prologue]]\" in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.\n\nOf all the maps in the published works of J.R.R. Tolkien, only [[Thrór's Map]] was made using a smaller scale, so the \"Part of the Shire\" map provides a wealth of geographic detail for [[the Shire]] not found anywhere else.\n==Creation==\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] had drawn four extant maps of the Shire. Eventually, [[Christopher Tolkien]] drew a large-scale map in [[1943]] in which he had some freedom to develop the details north of [[the Water]]. Many village names are actual English place-names (cf. [[Nobottle]], [[Rushock]], [[Newbury]], [[Needlehole]]), or emulate English toponymy. Christopher believes that he consulted the large collection of his father's books on English place-names from which he made his proposals, such as \"Nobottle\". To that map J.R.R. Tolkien also made his own additions, adding [[Budgeford]], [[Bridgefields]], and the road between [[Whitfurrows]] and [[Scary]]. There were also more names, such as \"Chivery\", \"Goatacre\", \"Ravenbeams\", and \"[[Long Cleeve]]\" that don't appear in the published map.<ref name=\"rc\" />{{rp|p. lvi}}\n\nFor the final version of the map, J.R.R. Tolkien did not allow those names that \"he thought poorly of\". The final map was drawn again by Christopher in [[March]] [[1954]].<ref name=\"rc\">{{HM|RC}}</ref>{{rp|lv}}\n\nIn his copy of the ''Fellowship,'' Tolkien added [[the Yale]], which was added since the second edition ([[1966]]) and afterwards.<ref>{{RS|3XXIIN}}, p. 387</ref> Tolkien also changed the position of [[Brandy Hall]] for the second edition to be ''before'' the Buckland road, consistent to the narrative.<ref name=\"rc\" />{{rp|p. lxi}}<ref>{{RS|2XVIII}}, p. 305</ref>\n\n==An Aid to the Story==\nThe \"Part of the Shire\" map runs 60 miles north to south and stretches 105 miles east to west.  Pieces (only) of all four [[Farthings]], all of [[Buckland]], and a sliver of land to the east of the [[The Shire|Shire]] are shown. From the narrative's \"point of view\" the map allows the reader to trace the start of [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s journey to [[Rivendell]], covering the trip from Chapter 3, \"[[Three is Company]]\", through part of Chapter 6, \"[[The Old Forest]]\" of Book I in ''The Fellowship of the Ring''. \n\nAlso it serves as a reference for the locations of events from Chapter 8, \"[[The Scouring of the Shire]]\" of Book VI in ''[[The Return of the King]]''. Indeed, J.R.R. Tolkien wished the map to be reprinted in the third volume,<ref>{{L|137}}, p. 168</ref> but it didn't happen.<ref name=\"rc\" />{{rp|p. lvi}}\n\n==Details of the Shire==\nHowever, this map also reveals many points of interest beyond the necessities of the plot. Twenty-one towns and villages are plotted on the map, with arrows pointing towards five Shire habitations not shown (plus an arrow that points towards [[Bree]]). The entire courses of the [[Stock-brook]], [[Thistle Brook]], and [[Shirebourn]] River are shown, as well as sections of [[The Water]], the [[Withywindle]], the Brandywine ([[Baranduin]]), and an unnamed stream from the north that flows into the [[Bywater Pool]] (which may have been the [[Norbourn]]). The whole forested area of the [[Woody End]] is on the map as well as parts of [[Bindbole Wood]] and the [[Old Forest]].\n\nThe villages on the map are indicated by very small black squares and rectangles clustered in groups. While reminiscent of buildings they probably do not represent the actual layout of the villages. The amount of \"buildings\" seems to indicate the relative size of the towns and villages shown but, since no population numbers were ever given for any Shire town, no quantitative judgments can be formed from this map.\n\nIn a 1965 letter to [[Dick Plotz]] (see [[Letter 276]]), Tolkien mentioned that there were only about 30 place names in the \"Part of the Shire\" map and that there were more in his map. If a proper map of the Shire were drawn up, there would be quite a large number of places named. Unfortunately, no such map was ever published.\n\n==Questionable Points==\nWhile making the various maps for the books and synchronizing them to the narrative descriptions, Tolkien had to decide whether he would follow the map or the text, but about the ''Part of the Shire'', he thought it was faulty and needed a lot of corrections and additions. Some of those noted were:\n{{quote|...the Ferry at Bucklebury and to Brandy Hall and Crickhollow have shifted about 3 miles too far north (about 4 mm.). This cannot be altered at this time, but it is unfortunate that Brandy Hall clearly on the river-bank is placed so that the main road runs in front of it instead of behind. There is also no trace of the wood described [in [[A Short Cut to Mushrooms]]]. I have had simply to disregard these map-errors.|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]<ref>{{L|274}}, p. 358</ref>}}\n\nThe position of Brandy Hall was corrected in subsequent editions (look above). Other questionable points:\n;Brockenborings/Brockenbores\n:The name of this place is given as ''[[Brockenborings]]'' on the map but as ''Brockenbores'' in the text of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', where [[Fredegar Bolger]] and his rebels were hiding.<ref>{{RK|Havens}}</ref>\n\n;Waymoot/Waymeet\n:On the ''Part of the Shire'' map, on the [[East Road]] west of the [[Three-Farthing Stone]] is the town of ''Waymoot''. In the chapter \"[[The Scouring of the Shire]]\", this town (where the ruffians kept sheds) was named ''[[Waymeet]]''.<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref> \"Waymeet\" is a more modern spelling of the older form, \"[[Waymoot]]\", which was [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien's]] preference in early drafts of ''[[The Return of the King]]''. Though he ultimately modernised the name within the book itself, this map was never corrected, and still carries the older spelling.<ref name=\"rc\" />{{rp|p. 660}}\n\n;Bindbole/Bindbale Wood\n:In the 1954 edition of ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]],'' the letter 'o' in ''Bindbole'' was unclear and appeared to be the letter 'a'.  The name was rendered at ''Bindbale'' in maps by [[Barbara Strachey]] and [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] in [[Robert Foster]]'s ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'', and even by Tolkien himself in a manuscript note when he prepared the document later known as ''[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings|Nomenclature]]''.<ref name=\"rc\" />{{rp|p. lvii}}\n\n;[[Hobbiton Road]] and [[Stock Road]]\n:These roads are mentioned in the narrative but no such names are marked on the map. Only an unnamed road is marked, which joins [[Tuckborough]] with Stock through [[Green Hill Country]] and Woody End. [[Karen Wynn Fonstad|Fonstad]] identified this road as the Stock Road.<ref>{{HM|AME}}</ref> Concerning the road from Hobbiton to [[Overhill]] (possibly the Hobbiton Road), it seems to run ''east'' of [[the Hill]], which is inconsistent to the illustration ''[[The Hill: Hobbiton-across-the Water]]'', showing that road running ''west''. The discrepancy has been noted by [[Barbara Strachey]].<ref name=\"rc\" />{{rp|p. lx}}\n{{references}}\n\n{{maps}}\n[[Category:Maps of the Shire]]\n[[fi:Kontu – osa]]"}}}
