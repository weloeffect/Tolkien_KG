The days around Yule were the Yule-tide.\n\nIn the [[Shire Calendar]], Yule referred to two days (the last of the previous and the first of the new year). Due to a peculiarity of the Calendar, the 2 Yuledays were \"between\" and outside the formal months of [[Foreyule]] and [[Afteryule]]. They always fell on the same days of the week: the last day of the year, [[1 Yule]], was always a [[Highday]] (Friday), while the first day of the following year, [[2 Yule]], was always a [[Sterday]] (Saturday).<ref name=\"Shire\">{{App|Shire}}</ref><ref group=note>On a modern calendar, they fell approximately on 21 and 22 December.</ref> \n\nAround them, the six-day festival of [[Yuledays|Yuletide]] was held, running from [[29 December|29]] [[Foreyule]] through [[2 January|2]] [[Afteryule]].<ref>{{App|Calendars}}</ref> \n\n==Etymology==\n{{quote|Very best wishes for Yule - J. R. R.

Since [[Gondorians]] of the [[Third Age]] were in part [[Northmen]], the word was recognisable as a 'northern name' for the midwinter festival.<ref name=\"Nomen\">{{HM|N}}, p. 781</ref>\n\nA [[Quenya]] word for \"Yule and the beginning of [[Sun]]'s return\" was '''''Amanar'''''.<ref>[[Letter to Jonathan Hepworth]] (referenced [https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/books-manuscripts/tolkien-john-ronald-reuel-two-autograph-6218450-details.aspx?from=searchresults&intObjectID=6218450&sid=8a118291-eca4-49f7-bdbd-4f21754d318c here])</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n{{Main|Turuhalmë}}\nIn [[Gnomish]], one of [[J.R.R.
