The [[Shirriffs]] of the troop was based in the [[Shirriff-house]] at [[Frogmorton]] on the [[East Road]]. It was the First Eastfarthing Troop that attempted to arrest [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and the [[Travellers]] on their return journey to [[Bag End]].   They could not keep up with the mounted Travellers on foot so they parted at [[Three-Farthing Stone]]. They arrived at Bywater shortly before the first skirmish with the [[Ruffians]]. Most of them took off their feathers and joined in the revolt aside from a few who slunk away. <ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Organisations in the Shire]]\n\n[[de:Erste Ostviertel-Schar]]\n[[fi:Itäneljännyksen Ensimmäinen Plutoona]]"}}}
