It is unknown if these two characters simply share a name, or are actually the same character.</ref><ref>{{CH|4}}</ref> was the youngest of the seven companions of [[Húrin]], remembering very few of the days before the [[Nírnaeth Arnoediad]].<ref name=\"Ragnir\">{{WJ|Hurin}}, pp. 262, 265</ref>\n\n== History ==\nRagnir was one of the seven ''\"desperate men\"'' who accompanied Húrin when he left [[Hithlum]].<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, p. 253</ref> [[Asgon]] guided the outlaws to ''\"one of the ancient passes that\"'' descended through the [[Ered Wethrin]] and down the course of the [[Lithir]] to the southern end of the [[Vale of Sirion]]. Húrin conceived a desire to return to [[Gondolin]], but could not tell the others due to his oath of secrecy. One night near the [[Brithiach]], Húrin waited until the others slept and then he slipped away.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, p. 261</ref>\n\nWhen it was found out that Húrin had disappeared, Ragnir suggested going home since to him it was clear that Húrin's wits had gone. Asgon stoutly said that Húrin was their lord and that they must find and follow him. Since Húrin had mentioned an errand in nearby [[Brethil]], Asgon suggested that they should seek him there. Ragnir wanted to know by whose leave they could enter the land since strangers were unwelcome. Asgon said that the Men of Brethil were good and argued that they would be welcomed since the [[Lord of Brethil]] was akin to the [[House of Hador]]. Since Asgon was known for his stout heart and being born with good luck the party followed him into the forest. Ragnir was more pessimistic than his companion [[Asgon]], as seen after Húrin abandoned his followers, but was willing to follow Asgon's lead.<ref name=\"Ragnir\"/>\n\nThe outlaws were soon noticed asleep in the wild by the march-wardens of [[Brethil]]. In the early morning, they were taken captive and brought before [[Ebor]], their captain, who claimed that because the [[Manthor|Master of the North-march]] was not with them at that time, he had to bring them before the new [[Halad|Chieftain of Brethil]], [[Hardang]] son of [[Hundad]]. The march-wardens blindfolded the outlaws, leading them by devious ways to [[Obel Halad]], where Hardang scorned and accused them of spying. Though he spared their lives due to [[Túrin|Túrin's]] slaying of the [[Glaurung|Serpent]] of [[Angband]], the outlaws were still ejected from Brethil and had their weapons taken due to Túrin's scorning and murder of [[Brandir]]. The company of outlaws were led blindfolded back to the [[North-march]]. Fortunately, [[Ebor]], gave them their weapons back, but warned them to not enter Brethil again, or they all would be killed on sight.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, pp. 263-264</ref>\n\nOnce safely away from Brethil, Ragnir wryly noted that Asgon's luck had held since they were still alive and asked him what they should do now. Asgon still wanted to seek Húrin and suggested that the company go to the [[Crossings of Taeglin]] where they would be most likely to hear any news. Ragnir commented that they might instead hear bow-strings and be killed on sight, but he went along westwards with the others. Unfortunately the detailed story of Húrin's wanderings was left unfinished so it remains unknown what became of Ragnir.<ref name=\"Ragnir\"/>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nIn a rejected phrase in the draft manuscript of ''\"[[The Wanderings of Húrin]]\"'', the name of the youngest companion of [[Asgon]] was written as ''\"Ragnir the tracker\"''.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, note 24, p. 302</ref>\n\n{{References|notes}}\n\n{{Title}}\n\n[[Category:Edain]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Folk of Hador]]\n\n[[fi:Ragnir (Asgonin kumppani)]]"}}}
