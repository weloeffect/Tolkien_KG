The most famous works take place late in the [[legendarium]]'s history, with hints to the backstory. The stories that comprise the background are relatively complex and have no obvious links to the most famous works. Furthemore, the stories-chapters-essays overlap each another, or take place simultaneously, differing only in the extensiveness of the details. \n\nHardcore fans read the works more than once. For example one can read ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' first, then ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and sometime later ''The Lord of the Rings'' again, in light of the backstory seen in ''The Hobbit''.\n\nThere can be various approaches:\n==Publication history==\nThis can be one of the most common approaches. \n*''The Hobbit''\n:People can start with ''The Hobbit'', as an easy and lighthearted fantasy story, which [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] published first, without having much backstory and historical details in mind.\n*''The Lord of the Rings''\n:This is the natural sequel of ''The Hobbit'' and completes the story. However it has many allusions to the greater world and ancient history of [[Arda]].\n*''[[The Silmarillion]]''\n:Published after Tolkien's death, it provides the cosmogony and earlier stories of Arda. It can give the reader insight about the world they already know.\n*''[[Unfinished Tales]]'' / ''[[The Children of Húrin]]'' / ''[[Beren and Lúthien]]'' / ''[[The Fall of Gondolin]]''\n:These books provide additional and extensive details about several aspects of the greater history.\n\n==Rough chronological order==\nA less common approach is to read the saga in chronologically accurate order:\n*''The Silmarillion''\n''The Silmarillion'' describes the beginnings of Tolkien's world.\n*''The Children of Húrin'', ''Beren and Lúthien'' and ''The Fall of Gondolin''\nThese books give an extended version of the Great Tales of the Elder Days, featured as a part of ''The Silmarillion''.\n*''Unfinished Tales''\nParts of this book give insight about [[Númenor]], the [[Second Age]] (mentioned in ''The Silmarillion'') and early [[Third Age]], with elements that will play their role in ''The Lord of the Rings''.\n*''The Hobbit''\nAlthough directly unrelated to ''The Silmarillion'', it is the next big story.\n*''The Lord of the Rings''\nThe conclusion of the story of ''The Hobbit'' as well as things mentioned in ''The Silmarillion''.\n\n==Exact chronological order==\n{|\n|''[[Ainulindalë]]''\n|\n|-\n|''[[Valaquenta]]''\n|\n|-\n|''[[Of the Beginning of Days]]''\n|\n|-\n|''[[Of Aulë and Yavanna]]''\n|\n|-\n|''[[Of the Coming of the Elves and the Captivity of Melkor]]''\n|\n|-\n|''[[Of Thingol and Melian]]''\n|\n|-\n|''[[Of Eldamar and the Princes of the Eldalië]]''\n|\n|-\n|''[[Of Fëanor and the Unchaining of Melkor]]''\n|\n|-\n|''[[Of the Silmarils and the Unrest of the Noldor]]''\n|\n|-\n|''[[Of the Darkening of Valinor]]''\n|\n|-\n|''[[Of the Flight of the Noldor]]''\n|\n|-\n|''[[Of the Sindar]]''\n|\n|-\n|''[[Of the Sun and Moon and the Hiding of Valinor]]''\n|\n|-\n|''[[Of Men]]''\n|\n|-\n|''[[Of the Return of the Noldor]]''\n|\n|-\n|''[[Of Beleriand and its Realms]]''\n|\n|-\n|''[[Of the Noldor in Beleriand]]''\n|\n|-\n|''[[Of Maeglin]]''\n|\n|-\n|''[[Of the Coming of Men into the West]]''\n|\n|-\n|''[[Of the Ruin of Beleriand and the Fall of Fingolfin]]''\n|\n|-\n|''[[Of Beren and Lúthien]]''\n|''[[Lay of Leithian]]''\n|-\n|''[[Of the Fifth Battle: Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]''\n|\n|-\n|''[[Of Túrin Turambar]]''\n|''The Children of Húrin''\n|-\n|''[[Of the Ruin of Doriath]]''\n|\n|-\n|''[[Of Tuor and the Fall of Gondolin]]''\n|''[[Of Tuor and his Coming to Gondolin]]''\n|-\n|''[[Of the Voyage of Eärendil and the War of Wrath]]''\n|\n|-\n|''[[Akallabêth]]''\n|''[[Aldarion and Erendis: The Mariner's Wife|Aldarion and Erendis]]''\n|-\n|}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.chronology.org/tolkien/ Chronological Tolkien] discusses the issue and also provides a calculator to find the exact reading order.\n\n[[Category:Fandom]]"}}}
