In its days of glory, the city featured quays to handle sea-going vessels that came up from the sea, a great stone bridge supporting houses and towers of stone, and the [[Dome of Stars]], which housed the [[Master Stone of Osgiliath]], the greatest of the seven ''[[Palantíri]]''.<ref name=\"rings\">{{S|Rings}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nFounded by [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]]<ref name=\"rings\" /> near the end of the [[Second Age]], Osgiliath was designated the capital of the southern Númenórean kingdom in exile, [[Gondor]]. \n\nSoon after its founding, Sauron attacked and [[First Fall of Minas Ithil|took]] [[Minas Ithil]] in {{SA|3429}} and then moved westward. While Isildur sought aid from the north, [[Anárion's defence of Osgiliath|Anárion defended the city]].<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref> When the army of the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|Last Alliance]] arrived and later defeated [[Sauron]] the threat to the city was lifted.<ref name=\"rings\" /> Thereafter, for over a thousand years, Osgiliath was the capital of Gondor, as well as its largest and most important city.\n[[File:Matěj Čadil - Osgiliath.jpg|thumb|left|''Osgiliath'' by [[Matěj Čadil]]]]\n\nThe beginning of the city's decline came in {{TA|1437}} when it was [[Burning of Osgiliath|sieged, sacked, and burned]] by the rebel [[Castamir]]'s forces during the [[Kin-strife]]. It was during this siege that the Master Stone of Osgiliath was lost in the River. The [[Great Plague]] of {{TA|1636|n}} led to further depopulation with many victims, and some fled to the western dales or [[Ithilien]]; few returned and the city began to fall into ruin; the [[King's House]] was moved to the more secure [[Minas Anor]] in {{TA|1640|n}}.<ref name=\"ta\">{{App|TA}}</ref>\n\nOver the next few hundred years, Gondor endured many military defeats east of the [[Anduin]], especially the [[Second Fall of Minas Ithil|taking]] of [[Minas Ithil]] in {{TA|2002|n}}. Osgiliath became vulnerable to attack and was widely believed to be haunted, as its population continued to shrink. Osgiliath was finally abandoned by the remaining civilian population after being [[Ruin of Osgiliath|overrun]] by [[Uruk-hai]] in {{TA|2475|n}}, although the orcs were defeated by Steward [[Boromir (Steward of Gondor)|Boromir]].<ref name=\"ta\" />\n\nOver the following centuries, the western part of the ruined city was under the control of Gondor, and was at times provided with a military garrison as a means of defending the crossing of the Anduin. The eastern part, with [[Ithilien]], was disputed territory, under Gondor's control for most of the rule of [[Denethor|Denethor II]], but in June of {{TA|3018|n}} it was [[Sauron's attack on Osgiliath|taken and occupied]] by [[Sauron]]'s forces and its last bridge fell. This attack some later considered to be the beginning of the [[War of the Ring]].<ref name=\"great\">{{App|Great}}</ref>\n\nIn the following March, well into the War, Sauron launched a full-scale invasion of Gondor west of the Anduin, and despite the [[Rangers of Ithilien|Rangers']] [[Faramir's defence of Osgiliath|defence of the western part of the city]], Osgiliath quickly fell to Sauron's forces,<ref name=\"great\" /> but it was reclaimed by Gondor after Sauron's ultimate defeat a few weeks later.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Osgiliath'' is [[Sindarin]] for \"Citadel of the Stars\"<ref>{{FR|Council}}, p. 244</ref> or \"Fortress of the Stars\",<ref name=\"RGEO\">{{RGEO|Notes}}, p. 65</ref><ref>{{L|347}}, p. 426</ref> being a combination of ''[[ost]]'' (\"citadel\", \"fortress\") + ''[[giliath]]'' (\"hosts of stars\").<ref name=\"UI\" />\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Osgiliath in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:War in Middle Earth - Osgiliath.png|Osgiliath in ''[[J.R.R.

Tolkien's War in Middle Earth]]'':'''\n:Osgiliath is one of the many maps of this game. The maps shows the bridge but the city itself is not shown.\n\n'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''\n:After capturing [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], [[Faramir]] takes them to Osgiliath, in the hope of harnessing the power of [[One Ring|the Ring]] to the betterment of Gondor. Osgiliath is fully ruined, and partly flooded. After being attacked by several [[fell beasts|winged Nazgûl]], Faramir releases them.\n\n:In a scene in the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (extended edition)|Extended Edition]], Faramir has a flashback. [[Boromir]] reclaims the city for Gondor, and the soldiers feast. The scene is meant to highlight the relation between Boromir, Faramir and [[Denethor]].\n\n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''\n:[[Gothmog (Lieutenant of Morgul)|Gothmog]] and his [[orcs]] finally breach the defences of the Gondorian troopers, and beat them back with heavy losses. [[Madril]] is slain, as are several others. On their retreat to [[Minas Tirith]], they are beset by the [[Nazgûl]], only to be saved by [[Gandalf]].\n\n:Not impressed by Faramir's deeds, and more upset about the loss of Osgiliath, Denethor sends his son back to Osgiliath, but his company is slaughtered, and Faramir badly wounded. This scene replaced the defence of the [[Causeway Forts]] in the book.\n\n'''2009: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'':'''\n:Osgiliath is featured in the game with it's appeareance being based on Peter Jackson's [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|films]]. It appears in both good and evil campaign.\n\n'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''\n:Concept art of Osgiliath was created by [[Snowblind Studios]] and appears in the trailer '''[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKu_v_NH7Ro&feature=player_embedded#!

It is unknown if Osgiliath will appear in the game.\n\n'''2015: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Osgiliath exists in three different versions in the game. Before the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], Osgiliath is overrun by the [[Morgul-host]], while [[Mablung (ranger of Ithilien)|Mablung]] and [[Damrod]] lead the surviving [[Rangers of Ithilien]] in the city into hiding in the culverts. After the Battle the situation is reversed: the city has been reclaimed as the Host of the West makes its way to the Black Gate, but remaining enemies still hold out in the culverts below. A third version of the city, set in T.A. 3018 during the [[Sauron's attack on Osgiliath]] is the battleground for player-versus-monster-player fights; this version is notable for having all bridges across the Anduin still intact.\n\n:The notable landmarks are the Gates of the Moon at the eastern entrance to the city are beyond which is the Court of [[Isildur]], the Gates of the Sun at the western entrance beyond which is the Court of [[Anárion]], The Palace of [[Eldacar (King of Gondor)|Eldacar]] in the north-west corner of the city, [[Meneldil]]'s Square, Rómendacil's Square, the Theatre of [[Cemendur (King of Gondor)|Cemendur]] and the [[Dome of Stars]].\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{FellowshipRoute}}\n\n[[Category:Cities, towns and villages]]\n[[Category:Gondor]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n\n[[de:Osgiliath]]\n[[fi:Osgiliath]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/villes tours et forteresses/gondor/osgiliath]]"}}}
