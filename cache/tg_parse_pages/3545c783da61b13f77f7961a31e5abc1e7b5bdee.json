As such, the exact sequence of events is not entirely clear.\n\n==Synopsis==\nAs [[Galadriel]] rides in her swan boat, [[Celeborn]] and a group of elves garb the Fellowship in their specially-made [[Elven cloaks|cloaks]]. Celeborn claims that no outsiders have ever worn such garments, and prays that they will shield the wearers from \"unfriendly eyes\".\n\nAs the Fellowship loads their boats and prepares to leave, [[Legolas]] notices [[lembas]] among the supplies, and tells [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] that one bite can fill a grown man's stomach. When Legolas moves out of earshot, Merry, knowing [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] very well, asks how many lembas his friend had already eaten; Pippin replies \"four\", followed by an audible belch.\n\nUnder the shelter of the trees, Celeborn warns [[Aragorn]] of the dangers ahead - including the appearance of \"strange creatures bearing the mark of the white hand\" ([[Saruman]]'s [[Uruk-hai]]) - and warns that the Fellowship is being tracked. He also gifts Aragorn with a large, elven-made hunting knife.\n\nAs they paddle down the [[Anduin]], the members of the Fellowship recall the gifts presented to them by Galadriel: Legolas received a beautifully crafted [[Bow of the Galadhrim|bow]]; Merry and Pippin ancestral daggers; [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] a coil of [[Elven rope]], and [[Gimli]] — though it isn't clarified until later — three stands of [[Hair of Galadriel|Galadriel's hair]] to remember her by. Aragorn recalls the conversation he had with Galadriel regarding the choice currently before [[Arwen]]; to remain in [[Middle-earth]] or take the ship to [[Valinor]]. While Galadriel doesn't fully voice her thoughts on the matter, she reminds Aragorn that his own destiny as [[King of Gondor]] still awaits his choice, and bids him farewell with his true name, ''Elessar''. Finally [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] recalls his gift of the [[Phial of Galadriel|phial]] containing the light from the [[Star of Eärendil]], and sees Galadriel on the riverbank bidding them farewell.\n\n==Differences==\n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring scenes|41]]"}}}
