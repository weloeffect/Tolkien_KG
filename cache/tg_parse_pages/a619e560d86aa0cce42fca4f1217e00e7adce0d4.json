It was revered by the [[Dwarves]] but usually occupied by [[Orcs]].\n\n==Description==\nFrom the northern part of the [[Vales of Anduin]], Mount Gundabad appeared to be the northern endpoint of the [[Misty Mountains]] and the western endpoint of the [[Grey Mountains]], although slightly separated from both ranges.<ref>{{H|Wilderland}}</ref> In actuality, the Misty Mountains continued past Mount Gundabad in a north-westerly direction (this extension was known as the [[Mountains of Angmar]]).  In all maps the mountain was shown as having three conjoined peaks. Bordering [[Forodwaith (lands)|Forodwaith]] to the north, the mountain undoubtedly had a cold climate.<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nAccording to the [[Dwarves]], [[Durin|Durin the Deathless]], eldest of the [[Fathers of the Dwarves]], awoke at Mount Gundabad shortly after the [[Awakening of the Elves]]. From that time forward, the mountain was revered by the Dwarves.<ref name=\"Relations\">{{PM|Relations}},p. 301</ref>  However, since Durin awoke alone he did not stay at the mountain; he walked southward until he founded [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]].<ref>{{FR|II4}}</ref>  In the early ages, Mount Gundabad did serve as a place of assembly for delegations of Dwarves, yet there is no mention of any making permanent residence there.<ref name=\"Relations\"/>\n \nIn {{SA|1695}}, [[Sauron]] invaded [[Eriador]].  In {{SA|1697|n}}, he [[Sack of Eregion|conquered]] [[Eregion]]<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref> and would have overwhelmed [[Elrond]], leading refugees northward, but he was attacked in the rear by forces sent from Khazad-dûm. Sauron drove the Dwarves back but could not breach the [[Doors of Durin]]. Frustrated, he commanded the Orcs to harry the Dwarves wherever they could be found.<ref>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>  Soon thereafter, came the [[First Sacking of Gundabad]], followed by a long occupation by Orcs.<ref name=\"Relations\"/>\n \nAround the year {{TA|1300}}, the realm of [[Angmar]] arose.<ref name=\"TA\">{{App|TA}}</ref> Its lands lay on both sides of the Misty Mountains<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref> so Mount Gundabad was part of its domains.  Although Angmar was destroyed in {{TA|1975|n}},<ref name=\"TA\"/> the last remnants of its people east of the mountains were driven away<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref> in {{TA|1977|n}}.<ref name=\"TA\"/> Gundabad itself remained populated with Orcs.\n \nAfter the death of King [[Thrór]] in {{TA|2790|n}}, the Dwarves gathered for vengeance. The [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]] began in {{TA|2793|n}}<ref name=\"TA\"/> and the [[Second Sacking of Gundabad]] occurred.<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref> Although it is likely that the Dwarves cleared the mountain of all Orcs, the Orcs returned and Mount Gundabad again served as their capital in the North.<ref name=\"Burst\">{{H|Burst}}</ref>\n \nIn {{TA|2941|n}},<ref name=\"TA\"/> [[Thorin]] [[Oakenshield]], [[Gandalf]], several Dwarves, and [[Bilbo Baggins]], entered the Misty Mountains. While in the mountains, the [[Great Goblin]] was killed and the party escaped.  Furious, the Orcs gathered at Mount Gundabad under the command of [[Bolg]] to seek revenge.  Hearing of the death of [[Smaug]], they marched on the [[Lonely Mountain]].<ref name=\"Burst\"/>  However, the Orcs lost the [[Battle of Five Armies]] and three parts of their numbers.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>  Orcs still lived at Mount Gundabad by the end of the [[Third Age]] but in a very reduced state.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Gundabad'' is said to be a \"in origin a [[Khuzdul]] name\". Its meaning, however, is unknown.<ref>{{HM|PM}}, p. 301</ref>\n\nA recogniseable element is Khuzdul ''gundu'', meaning \"underground hall\", but it is not known if this word is indeed part of the name ''Gundabad''.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/khuzdul.htm|articlename=Khuzdul|website=Arda|accessed=}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Hobbit - The Battle of the Five Armies - Gundabad fortress.jpg|thumb|350px|Gundabad in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]]]\n'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''\n\n:On their way to [[Rivendell]], [[Radagast]] and [[Gandalf]] are pursued by [[Azog]]'s [[Orcs]] and swift [[Wargs]] of Gundabad, according to Gandalf.\n\n'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''\n\n:Gundabad is a large fortress of the Misty Mountains, housing a large number of Orcs and bats. [[Legolas]] and [[Tauriel]] travel there and discover the second orc army heading for [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. Legolas remarks that their people fought a battle there in another Age and his mother was killed at that place.\n\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Gundabad.jpg|thumb|350px|left|Gundabad in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2020: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Gundabad is translated as \"Mountain-home\". The region lying before the Gates of Gundabad, between [[Langwell]] and [[Greylin]], is known as \"Elderslade\". Months after the fall of [[Sauron]], Elderslade is the site of the \"War of Three Peaks\", in which [[Durin VII|Prince Durin]], son of [[Thorin Stonehelm]], leads an army of [[Dwarves]] to reclaim Gundabad from the forces of \"Gorgar the Ruthless\", son of [[Bolg]].\n\n:Within the mountain, the \"Delvings of Gundabad\" are divided into five areas. \"Máttugard\" is the main citadel and site of Gundabad's throne. \"Deepscrave\" is a tall and deep cavern that once housed the common folk of Gundabad, now occupied by Orcs. The gem-studded \"Pit of Stone-jaws\" is home to Gundabad's tombs. In a basalt cavern at the heart of the mountain lies \"Gloomingtarn\", called in Khuzdul \"Durthuzâram\", the lake upon which Durin the Deathless awoke. The overgrown gardens of \"Clovengap\" are exposed to the sky through a rift in the mountainside.\n\n:To the north of Gundabad lies \"Câr Bronach\", the easternmost extent of Angmar. The western slopes of the mountain are called the \"Welkin-lofts\", and are the site of several dwarven structures, including a meeting place for the Seven Houses.\n\n:According to Longbeard legend, when he relocated his kingdom to Khazad-dûm, Durin I named his best friend, \"Mótsog\", the first Lord of Gundabad. He came to regret that decision, for Mótsog betrayed Durin and led his \"Greymaul\" followers in an uprising against their fellow Longbeards.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Dwarven realms]]\n[[Category:Dwarven names]]\n[[Category:Evil realms]]\n[[Category:Khuzdul words]]\n[[Category:Mountains]]\n[[de:Gundabad]]\n[[fi:Gundabadin vuori]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/reliefs/monts brumeux/mont gundabad]]"}}}
