It is possible however that both kindreds were associated with both cities, but there is no [[canon]]ical word on this.</ref>\n\nThe Dwarves built their great mansions in the mountains, commanding the only passes. These had probably been built even before the arrival of the Eldar into Beleriand on their [[Great Journey]].<ref>{{VT|48a4}}</ref>\n\nFrom their cities, the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains came down into [[Beleriand]] to trade with the Elves. These Dwarves were friends to the [[Sindar]]<ref name=\"Sindar\">{{S|Sindar}}</ref> and later allies of the [[Noldor]] of [[Beleriand]].<ref>{{S|Noldor}}</ref> They played a great part in the making of [[Thingol]]'s halls at [[Menegroth]], and later aided in the delving of [[Nargothrond]] beside [[Narog]].<ref name=\"Return\" /> [[Finrod]] rewarded them with treasures he brought from [[Tirion]]. It was during this time that the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains created the [[Nauglamír]] for [[Finrod]], the most renowned of their works of the [[Elder Days]].<ref name=\"Return\">{{S|Return}}</ref>\n\nAfter [[Morgoth]]'s return to Middle-earth, the Dwarves were loosely [[Union of Maedhros|allied]] with the Elves in the [[Wars of Beleriand]] that followed. They fought in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], where [[Azaghâl]] of [[Belegost]] drove [[Glaurung]] from the field but was himself slain. After the battle, relations between the Elves and Dwarves cooled; the [[Dwarves of Nogrod]] slew Thingol and stole the [[Nauglamír]], and after this time, enmity and mistrust grew between the two peoples.\n\n===Later History===\nThe cities of Nogrod and Belegost were ruined when [[Thangorodrim]] was broken in the [[War of Wrath]]. As a result, around {{SA|40}} many dwarves left Nogroad and Belegost and moved to [[Khazad-dûm]]<ref name=\"B1\">{{App|SA}}, entry for the year ''c.'' 40, p. 1083</ref> bringing their lore and craft with them,<ref name=\"Durin\">{{App|Durin}}, p. 1071</ref> however, there always remained some Dwarves on the eastern side of the Blue Mountains in days afterwards.<ref>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]], [[Thráin II]] and his people established a [[Thorin's Halls|new realm-in-exile]] in the northern Ered Luin beyond the [[Little Lune]].<ref name=\"Durin\" /> His people prospered in a fashion and were swelled in numbers by many of the wandering folk of Durin and they built many fair houses in the hills.<ref name=\"Dwarves\"/><ref name=\"Durin\" /> Years later, after King [[Thorin]] went on the [[Quest of Erebor]] and was killed in the [[Battle of Five Armies]], the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] was re-established by the new king [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin II Ironfoot]]. Many of the people of Durin's folk went to him and it became a great and prosperous kingdom once again.\n\nEven later in the [[Fourth Age]], Dwarves still lived in the east side of the Blue Mountains, especially south of the [[Gulf of Lune]] where they had active mines, and still travelled east along the [[East Road]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, p. 1039</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''\n:While [[Thorin and Company]] are lost in [[Mirkwood]], [[Bofur]] finds a dwarven tobacco pouch on the ground, which he recognizes as one from the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains. [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] tells him that it is his own pouch that fell earlier, and they are going on circles.\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:It is possible for Dwarf player characters to choose the Blue Mountains as their background, though this is only for aesthetic purposes and has no impact on the game's story or mechanics.\n\n:The Blue Mountain dwarves in the late Third Age are among the first non-player characters beginning Dwarf and Elf characters meet, and consist of both the noble Longbeards of Thorin's Hall and the villainous \"[[Dourhands]]\", renegades from the two Blue Mountain Houses. A later update introduced the \"Narfanghoth\" and the \"Landorrim\", the game's representations of the Firebeards and Broadbeams.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dwarves of Belegost]]\n*[[Dwarves of Nogrod]]\n*[[Longbeards]]\n\n{{references|n}}\n\n[[Category:Dwarven peoples]]\n[[de:Ered Luin]]\n[[fi:Sinivuoret]]"}}}
