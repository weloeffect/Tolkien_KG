For faster communication between the two allies, the [[warning beacons of Gondor]] were used. These beacons were placed on seven hills along the northern ridge of the [[White Mountains]].\n\n==History==\n===The Oath===\nThe Oath was first sworn in {{TA|2510}} by [[Cirion]], the twelfth Ruling Steward of Gondor, and by [[Eorl]], King of the [[Éothéod]] (later first King of Rohan) following the [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant]]. The Oath stated that the province of [[Calenardhon]] would be forever of Rohan, established its borders, and an alliance between the kingdoms. The two rulers swore their oaths on the [[Halifirien]] hill at the site of the [[Tomb of Elendil]].<ref name=Eorl/>\n\nEorl spoke his oath in [[Rohanese]]: \n\n{{blockquote|Hear now all peoples who bow not to the Shadow in the East, by the gift of the Lord of the Mundburg we will come to dwell in the land that he names Calenardhon, and therefore I vow in my own name and on behalf of the Éothéod of the North that between us and the Great People of the West there shall be friendship for ever: their enemies shall be our enemies, their need shall be our need, and whatsoever evil, or threat, or assault may come upon them we will aid them to the utmost end of our strength. This vow shall descend to my heirs, all such as may come after me in our new land, and let them keep it in faith unbroken, lest the Shadow fall upon them and they become accursed.|Eorl}}<ref name=Eorl/>\n\nIn addition to his oath, Cirion spoke an invocation in [[Quenya]] and the [[Westron|Common Speech]], calling the [[Valar]] and [[Ilúvatar|Eru]] to witness the oaths that were taken:\n\n{{blockquote|Vanda sina termaruva Elenna-nóreo alcar enyalien ar Elendil Vorondo voronwë.

Egalmoth p. 205</ref>\n\nDuring the rule of [[Beren (Steward of Gondor)|Beren]], both nations where overwhelmed; Gondor by the [[Corsairs of Umbar]] and Rohan by the Dunlendings, and couldn't help each other. After the [[Long Winter]] however, as the Rohirrim started to repel the invaders, Gondor sent help from both west and east of the [[White Mountains]] to assist them.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref><ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>\n[[File:Peter Xavier Price - And They Clasped Hand in Hand.jpg|thumb|''And they clasped hand in hand'' by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]]\nGondor sent great help to King [[Folcwine]] who reconquered the [[west-march]] from the Dunlendings. In {{TA|2885}}, when [[Ithilien]] was invaded in great strength, Folcwine sent many men, led by his twin prince sons, to Gondor. With their aid Steward [[Túrin II]] won a victory at the [[Crossings of Poros]], though the princes [[Fastred (son of Folcwine)|Fastred]] and [[Folcred]] were slain.<ref>{{App|Mark}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[War of the Ring]], the [[Red Arrow]] was brought to King [[Théoden]] of Rohan by [[Hirgon|a messenger of Gondor]] while [[Minas Tirith]] was besieged by [[Sauron]], and Théoden rode out with the [[Muster of Rohan]] to the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. \n\nThe Oath was renewed by [[Aragorn]] and [[Éomer]] upon their accessions to the thrones of Gondor and Rohan.\n\n==External links==\n*[http://glaemscrafu.jrrvf.com/english/cirion.html Text, translation and audio] at [[Glǽmscrafu]]\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Oaths and prophecies]]\n[[Category:Quenya texts]]\n[[Category:Third Age]]\n[[de:Eid von Eorl]]\n[[fr:encyclo/evenements/3a/serment d eorl]]\n[[fi:Cirionin vala]]"}}}
