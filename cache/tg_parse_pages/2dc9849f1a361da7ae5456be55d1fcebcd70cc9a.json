It was used in poultices to reduce fever.<ref>{{ICE|2010}}, p. 170</ref>\n\n:'''''Berterin''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''Baranas'', [[Quenya|Q.]] ''Varnissë''), also called ''Rot-not'', was a brown moss found in deciduous forests, usually growing on rocks in shady, cool areas. Common yet easily overlooked for its pale hue, it could be boiled into a powerful preservative for organic matter, keeping it intact for a day if the surface was treated with the brew.<ref>{{ICE|2026}}, pp. 88-89</ref>\n\n:'''''Cargalen''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] “Red-green,” [[Quenya|Q.]] ''Carnilaica'') was an iridescent red-green moss of the caves of [[Eriador]]. It grew in small patches, seldom more than two feet across, and retained its properties for up to a month. The moist surface carried a potent nerve poison, sometimes used by assassins, that could cripple limbs or even prove fatal. Its effects, however, could be countered by herbs known to repair nerve damage.<ref>{{ICE|2026}}, p. 93</ref>\n\n:'''''Dinfuin''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] “Night-silence,” [[Quenya|Q.]] ''Fuinelínë'') was a dark green moss of [[Mirkwood]], often found in large patches on rocks and forest slopes. It would make for a great resting spot, but pressure on the moss could release an oil that caused temporary amnesia. When foraged and rendered safe, it made for highly regarded mattress stuffing.<ref>{{ICE|2010}}, p. 174</ref><ref>{{ICE|2026}}, p. 99</ref>\n\n:'''''Edram''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''Mithnedh'', [[Quenya|Q.]] ''Sinnirwa''), also called Bonehae and Jokisammal, was a silvery-grey moss growing in broad patches along the banks of cold streams and lakes. Plush and pleasantly fragrant, it was often used as bedding, but freshly picked it could also be eaten to mend broken bones within hours. Its potency lasted only a minute after harvest, after which it became useless.<ref>{{ICE|2010}}, p. 174</ref><ref>{{ICE|2026}}, pp. 101-102</ref>\n\n:'''''Fangorth''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] “Dread-beard,” [[Quenya|Q.]] ''Carnihísë''), also known as ''Redfog'', ''Adisakheg'', and ''Gorfang'', was a red or purple moss that grew in hair-like clumps in the high crevices of [[Moria]]. When disturbed, it emitted a reddish mist that induced sleep, and its juices were often fatal. After releasing its vapours, it required a week to recover its potency.<ref>{{ICE|2010}}, p. 175</ref><ref>{{ICE|2026}}, p. 103</ref>\n\n:'''''Harwite''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''Onodnestad'', [[Quenya|Q.]] ''Ontonestalë''), also called ''Chelas'', was a deep green moss found in rectangular patches in [[Fangorn Forest]]. When chewed it healed concussion injuries, while applied as bandages it healed wounds. The Ents also used harwite in their draughts, filtering and strengthening their mixtures.<ref>{{ICE|2010}}, p. 176</ref><ref>{{ICE|2026}}, p. 109</ref>\n\n:'''''Lääkesavu''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''Nestosp'', [[Quenya|Q.]] ''Nestusquë''), or ''Medicine Smoke'', was a reddish moss growing in small quantities along the tundra rivers of [[Forochel]]. When dried, burned and inhaled, it restored vitality and hastened healing, and when smoked in a pipe consecrated by a [[Lossoth]] ''viisas'' its power was greatly increased.<ref name=p116>{{ICE|2026}}, p. 116</ref>\n\n:'''''Laicahwan''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''Calenbwan'', [[Quenya|Q.]] “Green Moss”) was a short, beard-like moss of blue-grey colour. It grew in small patches on the upper banks of streams. When applied as a poultice, it reduced fevers.<ref name=p116/>\n\n:'''''[[Aulë|Mahal]]’s Gift''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''Aulan'', [[Quenya|Q.]] ''Aulëanna'') was a silvery-blue moss that grew freely in the mountains. Brewed into a tea, it restored strength by curing concussion damage.<ref>{{ICE|2026}}, p. 120</ref>\n\n:'''''Melandar''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''Lhidirith'', [[Quenya|Q.]] ''Hlívecundo''), also called ''Baneward'' or ''Malostiss'', was a bright green moss found along northern coasts and riversides in cold climates. In its short growing season it appeared dusted with black soot, which were in fact its spores; the rest of the year it lay dormant beneath ice and snow. When simmered into a mild-tasting brew, it granted resistance to disease for many days. Properly dried, it kept well for long storage.<ref>{{ICE|2026}}, p. 121</ref>\n\n:'''''Numellossë''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''Andúlos'', [[Quenya|Q.]] “Snow of the West”), also called Mossist, was a dense moss of blue-green colour. It grew only at the foot of the [[White Tree of Gondor|White Trees of Arnor and Gondor]]. A small piece consumed gradually repaired nerve damage. The moss was tied to the fate of the White Tree itself, becoming extinct if the tree were to perish.<ref>{{ICE|2010}}, p. 180</ref><ref>{{ICE|2026}}, pp. 126-127</ref>\n\n:'''''Reglen''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''Caranfang'', [[Quenya|Q.]] ''Carnifanga'') was a short, dark green moss with a reddish underside, found on the north-facing sides of fallen logs in deciduous forests. Dried and brewed, it produced a healing draught that restored vitality and calmed the patient, retaining its power for about a month after harvest.<ref>{{ICE|2026}}, pp. 130-131</ref>\n\n:'''''Shimmer Sprig''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''Narthiliol'', [[Quenya|Q.]] ''Anarsílala'') was a bright green moss that grew in leg-sized patches around certain springs in northern woodlands. It shimmered in the setting sun and, when chewed, induced visions of natural activity within a wide radius. This allowed the user to discern unnatural disturbances, but carried the risk of continual distraction if overused. Rangers and Wood-elves were known to trick companions into “chewing sprig” as a jest.<ref>{{ICE|2026}}, p. 135</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Plants]]"}}}
