They served [[Sauron]] since early on, guarding the passes and troubling the folk of [[Eriador]]. These Orcs were also responsible for the death of [[Isildur]] and the loss of the [[One Ring]]. Later on, though they harassed the peoples and regions around them on their own for a time, their bond to Sauron remained strong and even though he commanded from the far main dominions of [[Dol Guldur]] and [[Mordor]] they still carried out his will, occupying [[Moria]] and barring the paths through the mountains. \n\n==History==\nTheir origin, and when they settled those tunnels is not known. However, they recognised and hated the [[Gondolin]]-forged blades [[Orcrist]] and [[Glamdring]], so this may indicate some awareness of the [[Elder Days]].\n===Second Age===\nOrcs who survived the [[War of Wrath]] fled to the East and harassed the [[Dwarves]] south of the [[Forodwaith]]. By the [[Dark Years]], when [[Moria]] closed its gates the Orcs reinforced and commanded by servants of [[Sauron]] invaded the mountains again. It is said that [[Gundabad]] [[Fall of Mount Gundabad|was re-taken]] (suggesting that it was again occupied by Orcs in the past).<ref name=\"pmd\">{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref>{{rp|p. 305}} \n\nMuch later Sauron, knowing of the [[Last Alliance]], sent many [[Orcs of Mordor]] to harry the Allied forces who would attempt to cross the Mountains. However, the main might of [[Gil-galad]] and [[Isildur]] who crossed the [[Pass of Imladris]] and the [[Pass of Caradhras]] made the Orcs to hide themselves; even [[Thranduil]]'s diminished army was far too strong. The Orcs bided their time mostly hidden in [[Mirkwood]] or along the river-banks, remaining alert and watchful for companies of [[Elves]] or [[Men]] that they could outnumber. After the [[War of the Last Alliance]], these Orcs would have no news of its outcome and Sauron's fall and they'd probably think that he won. The small detachment was eventually forgotten.<ref name=\"glad\" />{{rp|Note 20}}\n\n===Third Age===\nIt was under the command of such Orc-chiefs from [[Barad-dûr]] they ambushed and killed [[Isildur]] at the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]] in early [[Third Age]], their fierceness probably caused by the presence of the [[One Ring]].<ref name=\"glad\">{{UT|Gladden}}</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|1300}}, the Orcs started increasing and harassing the [[Dwarves]] again.<ref name=\"B2\" />\n\nThe awakening of [[Durin's Bane]] drove the Dwarves from [[Moria]] in {{TA|1981}}, and Orcs of the Misty Mountains entered and occupied its ruins.<ref name=\"A\">{{App|A}}</ref> Around {{TA|2480|n}}, after mighty black [[Uruk-hai|Uruks]] issued from [[Mordor]] and devastated [[Ithilien]] in {{TA|2475|n}},<ref name=\"Stewards\">{{App|Stewards}}, p. 1053</ref> Sauron started to populate Moria with his creatures, and in the same time the Orcs begun to make secret strongholds in the Mountains so as to bar all the passes into [[Eriador]].<ref name=\"B2\">{{App|B2}}</ref> In {{TA|2509|n}}, on a trip to [[Lothlórien|Lórien]] to visit her parents, [[Celebrian]] was waylaid by Orcs in the [[Caradhras#The Redhorn Gate|Redhorn Pass]]. She was captured and tormented, receiving a poisoned wound until her [[Elladan|two]] [[Elrohir|sons]] rescued her.<ref name=\"B2\" />\n\nApparently Sauron forged an alliance between the Orcs and the [[Balchoth]], a tribe of [[Easterlings]]; in the spring of {{TA|2510}}, Orcs and Balchoth overran [[Calenardhon]].<ref name=\"B2\" /> The [[Gondorian]] army moved against the Balchoth north of the [[Limlight]], when a horde of Orcs from the Mountains suddenly attacked and surrounded them. The Gondorians were pressed towards [[Anduin]] until the [[Éothéod]] came to their rescue.<ref name=\"B2\" /><ref name=\"Stewards\"/>\n\nAround {{TA|2740|n}}, the Orcs became more bold, daring to invade Eriador. The [[Rangers of the North]] fought many battles with the sons of Elrond trying to hold them back, but one party managed to reach [[the Shire]] in {{TA|2747|n}}. They were fought off by a party of brave Hobbits under [[Bandobras Took]], who killed their leader [[Golfimbul]] in the [[Battle of Greenfields]].<ref>{{H|1}}</ref><ref name=\"Eriador\">{{App|Eriador}}</ref>\n====War with the Dwarves====\nIt seems that some Dwarves, either before or after the War of the Dwarves and Orcs, dwelt on the eastern side of the mountains near [[Goblin-town]].{{fact}}\n\n[[File:Mikel Janin - Battle of Azanulbizar.jpeg|left|thumb|''The Battle of Azanulbizar'' by Mikel Janin]]\nLong afterwards, Moria became the seat of an Orc-chieftain named [[Azog]] who slew King [[Thrór]] of the [[Durin's Folk|Longbeards]], beginning the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]]. In {{TA|2793|n}} the Dwarves sought revenge, assailing and sacking one by one all the Orc-holds they could from [[Second Sacking of Gundabad|sacking]] [[Gundabad|Mount Gundabad]] in the north, to the [[Gladden Fields]] in the south. Most of the war was fought underground, in the mines, halls, and other dwellings the Orcs had occupied or created. The war ended with the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] where Azog himself was slain,<ref name=\"A\" /> causing thousands of Orcs to flee south through [[Rohan]], who found refuge in the [[White Mountains]], troubling the Rohirrim for two generations.\n\nThe Orcs of the Misty Mountains virtually disappeared as a threat for [[Eriador]] and [[Rhovanion|Wilderland]], but the Dwarves were unable to reclaim Moria.\n\n[[Gandalf]] believed that the Orcs drove the [[bears]], as well as [[Beorn]]'s people, from their home in the mountains. Beorn promised that one time he would return.<ref>{{H|7}}</ref>\n\n====Quest for Erebor and beyond====\nThe [[Goblin-town]] had a main gate in one of the passes of the Mountains from which they assaulted travellers. As that way was eventually too dangerous and abandoned, by {{TA|2941|n}} travellers took the (seemingly safer) [[High Pass]], so the goblins opened the [[Front Porch]] as an alternate means to snatch people.<ref name=\"h6\">{{H|6}}</ref>\n[[File:Capucine Mazille - The Battle of Five Armies.jpg|thumb|''The Battle of Five Armies'' by Capucine Mazille]]\nA group of Orcs under the leadership of the [[Great Goblin]], started planning a joint raid with the [[Wargs]] against the [[Woodmen]] to capture slaves.<ref name=\"h6\" /> When they discovered [[Thorin and Company]], they thought they were spies of those woodmen and hunted them down, fearing they would warn their people. They escaped with [[Gandalf]]'s help, killing the Great Goblin in the process.<ref>{{H|Hill}}</ref>\n\nFurious, the Orcs gathered at Mount [[Gundabad]] under the command of [[Bolg]] to seek revenge and secure domination of the North. The goblins were about to sweep southward when they learned of the death of Smaug and marched by night through the mountains and appeared unexpectedly at [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], almost immediately after the arrival of [[Dáin Ironfoot]], and participated the [[Battle of Five Armies]].<ref>{{H|Burst}}</ref> It ended in defeat for the Orcs (three fourths of their entire population killed), and left the Misty Mountains free of them for many years afterwards.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|2989|n}}, [[Balin]] left the [[Lonely Mountain]] and entered Moria with [[Balin's folk|other Dwarves]] to start a colony and restore Khazad-dûm. The company had a great battle near [[Mirrormere]] where the great chieftain was killed, allowing them to settle in Moria and explore. But the Orcs later counter-attacked, and in {{TA|2994|n}}, the entire expeditionary force was [[Battle of the Second Hall|besieged]] and [[last stand of Balin's folk|destroyed]].<ref name=\"B2\" /><ref name=\"Bridge\">{{FR|Bridge}}</ref>\n\n====War of the Ring====\nBy the time of the [[War of the Ring]], the [[Beornings]] under [[Grimbeorn]] kept open the [[High Pass]] and the [[Ford of Carrock]] and no Orc or [[Wargs|Wolf]] dared to enter his land.<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}</ref> The Orcs of the Mountains though permanently depleted, reclaimed Moria though returning to the service of the Dark Lord Sauron. \n\nSauron's turncoat servant, the fallen [[Wizard]] [[Saruman]] also stirred up the Orcs tribes in the Mountains, gathering [[Orcs of Isengard|some]] of the forces he used against the kingdom of [[Rohan]] from there.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}, p. 1070</ref> When the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] travelled through [[Moria]] many Orcs, including some large [[Uruk-hai|Uruks]] of [[Mordor]] pursued them to the [[Chamber of Mazarbul]].
