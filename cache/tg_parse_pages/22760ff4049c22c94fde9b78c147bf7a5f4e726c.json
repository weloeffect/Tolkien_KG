In the [[Days before days]], after descending into [[Arda]], Melkor [[First War|fought a long war]] against the [[Valar]], led by [[Manwë]], until he was eventually driven off by the arrival of [[Tulkas]].\n\nThe Valar then constructed the [[Two Lamps]] and Arda entered a [[Spring of Arda|period of peace and flourishing]]. Melkor, gathering other spirits to his side, returned in secret however, and eventually threw down the Lamps. The Valar then retreated to [[Aman]], leaving Melkor near uncontested mastery over [[Middle-earth]].\n\nOnce the Valar learned of the [[Awakening of the Elves]] within Middle-earth, they resolved to regain mastery over Arda, and  launched a direct assault against Melkor.\n\n== The chaining ==\nEventually, the Valar confronted Melkor directly within the deeps of his fortress [[Utumno]] where he was defeated and, by Tulkas, bound with [[Angainor]]. Melkor was carried by to Valinor and sentenced to a long term of incarceration in the Halls of Mandos by [[Manwë]], his brother and the chief of the Valar.<ref name=\"Captivity\">{{S|Captivity}}</ref>  \n\nAt the end of the third age of his captivity, Manwë pardoned Melkor and released him from his bondage,<ref>{{S|Feanor}}</ref> but he turned back to darkness, destroying the [[Two Trees of Valinor|Two Trees]] and fleeing back to his [[Angband|strongholds in the north]] of Middle-earth with the stolen [[Silmarils]].<ref>{{S|Darkening}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:First Age]]\n[[Category:Periods]]"}}}
