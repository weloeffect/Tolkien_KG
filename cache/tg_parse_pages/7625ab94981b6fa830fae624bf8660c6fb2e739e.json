Young [[Eärendel]] befriends the Oarni at the [[Mouths of Sirion]], who love him. Later however he is shipwrecked at the [[Fiord of the Mermaid]] by the treachery of [[Ossë]] and another kind of mermaids enchant his sailors; Tolkien noted that they were possibly \"[[earthlings]] or [[fays]]? - or both\".<ref group=note>Possibly they were the Wingildi, servants of Ossë who hated Eärendel</ref> Later the Oarni save Eärendel at [[Falasquil]] when Ossë wrecked him again. Finally, it is mentioned that the Oarni helped him build [[Wingilot]] at Falasquil, with which he sailed for [[Valinor]].\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe mermaids were part of what apparently was a three-fold division of the lesser [[Ainur|Ainu]] spirits: [[sylphs]] (spirits of the air), [[sprites]] (spirits of the earth), and water spirits.<ref name=LT1-66>{{LT1|III}}, p. 66</ref>\n\nIn poems, the foam-fays are described as having \"blossom-white hair\" shining \"in the light of the sun\", \"pale arms on the sea's bosom\", and to be \"chanting wild songs\".<ref name=MC/>\n\nUi (the precursor of [[Uinen]]) was given the title ''Oarista'' (\"Queen of Mermaids\").<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry \"Ónen\"</ref><ref>{{PE|12}}, p. 97</ref>\n\n== Names and divisions ==\nA basic division of two groups of water spirits, with their [[Elvish]] names, are given as follow:\n\n*'''''Oarni''''' (troop of [[Ossë]]): \"spirits of the sea\"; also '''''Oaritsi''''' (from ''oaris'', \"mermaid\")<ref name=LT1Index>{{LT1|Index}}</ref>\n*'''''Falmaríni''''' and '''''Wingildi''''' (troop of [[Ossë]]): \"spirits of the sea-foam\"<ref name=LT1Index/> (also '''''wingildin''''', \"foam-maidens, foam-fays\";<ref name=MC/> '''''wingild-''''' \"nymph\",<ref name=PE12/> or \"foam-maiden\";<ref>{{PE|16}}, p. 100</ref> ''wingi'' \"mermaid, foam-maid\";<ref name=PE21/> and ''wingil'' \"sea-nymph\"<ref>{{PE|14}}, p. 42</ref>)\n\nAlso mentioned are ''flathwin'' or ''-nir'' (\"foam fay\"), and ''nendil'', ''nennil'' (\"waterfay\").<ref>{{PE|11}}</ref> A [[Qenya]] gloss is given as ''nindari'' (\"river-maid, nymph\").<ref name=PE21>{{PE|21}}, p. 14</ref>\n\n== Later legendarium ==\nMermaids are not mentioned in the later versions of the [[legendarium]]. Many of the classes of beings references in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' were superseded by the concept of the [[Maiar]], which were not introduced until the reworking of the [[Annals of Valinor]] into the [[Annals of Aman]].<ref name=\"MRP2b\">{{MR|P2b}}</ref>\n\n== Inspiration and other mentions ==\n[[Patrick H. Wynne]] and [[Christopher Gilson]] have noted that Tolkien's use of nymphs (and related spirits) is likely influenced by [[Wikipedia:Paracelsus|Paracelsus]]'s chart of four elementals: ''sylphs'' (air), ''pygmies'' or ''gnomes'' (earth), ''nymphs'' (water), and ''salamanders'' (fire).<ref>{{PE|14}}, p. 8</ref>\n\nAccording to [[C.S. Lewis]], Tolkien once told him that historical people in a sense did not falsely claim to see \"nymphs in the fountains and woods and [[dryads]] in the wood\", since the production of food was closely connected to one's own land and territory: people came to internalise the nature surrounding them.<ref>[[C.S. Lewis]], ''[[The Collected Letters of C.S. Lewis: Family Letters 1905-1931]]'', letter from 1930</ref>\n\n== Portrayal in adaptations ==\n'''1995-8: ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]'':'''\n:The Ally card \"Nenseldë the Wingild\", portraying a unique character, is playable at Dol Amroth.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Sprites]]\n*[[Sylphs]]\n*[[Fairies]]\n\n== External links ==\n*{{WP|Mermaid}}\n\n{{references|n}}\n[[Category:Water-fays]]\n[[de:Oarni]]\n[[de:Falmaríni]]\n[[de:Wingildi]]"}}}
