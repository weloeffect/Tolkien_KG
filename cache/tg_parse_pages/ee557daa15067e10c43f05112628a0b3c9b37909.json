Once there, the heralds of the riders hewed off Gelmir's limbs and left him to die.\n\nWhile the heralds and the riders were perished in the charge of [[Gwindor|Gwindor's]] [[Elves|company]], it is unknown if the Captain of Morgoth was slain as well.<ref name=Fifth/>\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Characters in The Children of Húrin]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:Evil]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Servants of Melkor]]"}}}
