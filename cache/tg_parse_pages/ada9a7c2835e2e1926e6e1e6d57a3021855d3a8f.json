Hlothran was \"a fairly common village-name in the Shire\",<ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref> though none is mentioned (or noteworthy enough) on any map.\n\n==Inspiration==\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] chose to couple the Cottons with the [[Gamgee family|Gamgees]] because of ''Gamgee cotton'' (also known as ''Gamgee tissue''), a surgical tissue he heard of as a child.
