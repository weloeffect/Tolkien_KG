It was the domain of King [[Augustus Bonifacius]]. One of the villages within the realm was called [[Ham]] and there lived [[Farmer Giles]].\n\nKing Augustus Bonifacius was not a good ruler of the land. He was greedy, uncaring of his heirlooms, and kept a retinue of worthless knights. Eventually his misrule led to Farmer Giles' decision to establish himself as an independent lord and eventually the king of the new [[Little Kingdom]]. Due to the tamed dragon [[Chrysophylax]] that Giles had in Ham, Augustus Bonifacius was unable to prevent the separation of Giles' realm from the Middle Kingdom.<ref>[[J.R.R.
