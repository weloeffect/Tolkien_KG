Jens Kidman)''' is a death metal song composed by Bear McCreary for Damrod the troll in [[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]. It features Jens Kidman on vocals. According to Bear McCreary, he saw how Damrod brutalized friend and foe alike and that brought sound of death metal into his head. The lyrics are loosely based on verses from ''[[The Stone Troll]]'', a poem by [[Samwise Gamgee]].\n\n==Lyrics==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nIn humid mold, Troll sits alone.\nNo friend or kin to call his own.\nTroll gnaws on skins;\nRaw shanks and shins;\nRips meat from reeking dragon bone.\n\nWith laughter deep and throaty groan,\nHe rises from his seat of stone.\nFrom darkened cave,\nA bloodlust crave,\nSet loose upon the hills to roam.\n\n(Chorus)\nSnap go the bones! (Snap! Snap!)\nCrunch go the teeth! (Crunch! Crunch!)\nTroll cracking spines (Crack! Crack!)\nBeneath his feet! (Crunch! Crunch!)\n\nNow the battle horn has blown,\nFrom final fight he has been shown.\nTo darkened cave,\nA bloodless grave,\nHe sits with heart, of hardened stone.\n\nIn humid mold, Troll sits alone.\nRips meat from reeking dragon bone.\nTroll gnaws on skins;\nRaw shanks and shins;\nNo friend or kin to call his own.\n\n(Chorus x2)\n\nTroll turns foe flesh to meat.\n</poem>\n\n==External links==\n[https://bearmccreary.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-damrod/ The Lord of the Rings: Damrod] by [[Bear McCreary]] (a blog entry by the composer detailing the creation of the song)\n\n[[Category:songs (real-world)]]\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series)| ]]"}}}
