[[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] was able to pick up a few lines from one about them:\n{{blockquote|Tall ships and [[High Men|tall kings]]<br>Three times three,<br>What brought they from the [[Númenor|foundered land]] <br>Over the [[Belegaer|flowing sea]]? <br>[[Seven Stars|Seven stars]] and [[palantíri|seven stones]] <br>And one [[White Tree|white tree]].}}\nWhen Pippin inquired about it, Gandalf suggested that [[Hobbits]] may have forgotten them all. To this, Pippin told him that they have their own rhymes which Gandalf would presumably not be interested in hearing,<ref name=\"gandalf\">{{TT|III11}}, p. 597</ref> such as [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam's]] rhyme of ''[[Oliphaunt]]''.<ref>{{TT|IV3}}</ref> After this, Gandalf explained that this particular rhyme refers to the [[Palantíri]] that were made long ago by the [[Noldor]], possibly by [[Fëanor]] himself, and \"''they were remembered only in a rhyme of lore among the [[Dúnedain]]''\" of [[Arnor]].<ref name=\"gandalf\"/>\n\nThe [[Long List of the Ents]] may also be an example of a Rhyme of Lore.<ref name=guide>{{HM|Guide}} p. 329</ref>\n\n== Inspiration ==\nThe Rhyme that Gandalf muttered had been running through Tolkien's mind for some time, even before having thought of the ''palantíri'' or what the \"seven stones\" were. When finally he wrote about [[Wormtongue]] hurling the [[Orthanc-stone]], he made the connection.<ref>{{L|163}}, p. 217</ref>\n\n[[Robert Foster]] theorized that the Rhymes of Lore were designed as a medium to aid in the retention of various ancient facts.<ref name=guide/> They are comparable to [[Wikipedia:Gnomic poetry#Medieval and early modern gnomic literature|Gnomic Verses]] that preserve important ideas of the Anglo-Saxon society. Their rhyme make them easy to remember.<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Anglo-Saxon-Part-1.pdf|articlename=Tolkien Society Anglo-Saxon Study Pack 1|dated=2014|website=[http://www.tolkiensociety.org The Tolkien Society]}}</ref>\n\n== Portrayal in adaptations ==\nA musical version of this poem was recorded by the [[Tolkien Ensemble]] on their album ''[[A Night in Rivendell]]''.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Lays and tales within the legendarium]]\n[[Category:Poems in The Two Towers]]"}}}
