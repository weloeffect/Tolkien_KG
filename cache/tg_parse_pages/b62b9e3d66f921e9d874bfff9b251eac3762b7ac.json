Tolkien]], to be sung to the tune of ''The Vicar of Bray''. It is published as the 26th song in ''[[Songs for the Philologists]]'' in [[1936]].\n\n==The song==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\n'''Frenchmen Froth'''\n\nThough Frenchmen froth with furious sound\n    And fill our frousty mansions,\nAnd gurgling uvulas are ground,\n    And tremblers pay 'attention';\nThough History roll in dreary round\n    Colonial expansion,\nAnd king and parliamentary hound,\n    And constitutional sanction,\n\nThis is my faith, I do maintain, until the stars shall fall, sir!\nLet other lands be what they claim, is England best of all, sir!\n\nIn mathematics' mouldering shed\n    Though tangled runes be written\nBy faces grave of men long dead\n    That worms have sorely bitten;\nThough Greek and Latin in one bed\n    With sleeping-sickness ridden\nDo dream of days when classics bled\n    A weary world unchidden,\n\nThis is my faith, I do maintain, until the stars shall fall, sir!\nOf all the arts this hath my heart - the English tongue fore all, sir!\n\nThough Education quack, quack, quack\n    And force upon our weasands\nThe nostrums from its nonsense pack\n    In endless silly seasons\nThough tyrant force behind our back\n    Shall thrust us without reason\nTo halls that light and learning lack\n    Where teachers talk of treason,\n\nThis is my faith, I do maintain, until the stars shall fall, sir!\nThat fear and false report shall not make English fall, sir!\n\nThough some will strip their stupid souls\n    (At least to the pyjamas),\nThough sages green with puny polls\n    Write dismal little dramas;\nThough critics jibber in their holes\n    Of style and form and metre,\nYet literature (the little moles!)\n    They miss her when [they] meet her.\n\nThis is my faith, I do maintain, while songs by men are sung, sir!\nThey only earn the English name who learn the English tongue, sir!\n</poem>\n\n[[Category:Poems and songs in Songs for the Philologists]]"}}}
