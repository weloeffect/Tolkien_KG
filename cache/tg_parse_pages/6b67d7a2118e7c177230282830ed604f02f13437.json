Tolkien]] at [[King Edward's School]] in [[Birmingham]]. \n\nThomas was a keen member of the debating society, and performed in Sheridan’s 'The Rivals' with Tolkien whilst at School. Tolkien, as secretary of the debating society, wrote of Thomas in the Chronicle of June [[1911]]: ''\"A loyal upholder of the Society who has never failed to display his unusual fluency (as distinct from argument) and remarkable talent for personalities of amiable virulence. Has never condescended to attempt to ingratiate himself with the Secretary\"''.<ref name=\"Edwards\"/> Thomas was also a member of the [[T.C.B.S.]], though not within the inner circle of friends. \n\nWhile reading History at [[Cambridge]] he decided to join the 1st Birmingham Battalion, and serve in the [[World War I|war]]. After rising to the rank of Captain, in August [[1916]] he was buried alive by a trench mortar, though he managed to escape and return to England. After being sent to Belgium in July 1917 he was killed in action near Ypres while consoling a captured prisoner. Barnsley would be one of many of Tolkien's friends that died in the war.<ref>[[John Garth|Garth, John]], ''[[Tolkien and the Great War]]''</ref>\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Barnsley, Thomas Kenneth}}\n[[Category:British people]]\n[[Category:People by name]]\n[[Category:T.C.B.S.]]"}}}
