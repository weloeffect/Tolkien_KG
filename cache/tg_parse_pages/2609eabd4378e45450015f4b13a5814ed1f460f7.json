They are used most commonly by the dwarves, who are implied to be their original inventors. They can be sometimes found in the possession of some half-elves and half-trolls as well. Hobbits also occasionally use them, specifically smaller light crossbows. These are referred to as \"bracebows\".<ref>{{ICE|2000}}</ref><ref>{{ICE|2001}}</ref>\n\n'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''\n:In the film, the [[Uruk-hai]] use fairly large crossbows at [[Helm's Deep]], presumably designed by Saruman. The Uruk crossbowmen are featured relatively little in scenes during the siege, mainly at the beginning and while trying to conquer the first gatehouse of the fortress, shooting at the defenders through gaps in the damaged gate. They use their crossbows with ease and deadly accuracy. Though the crossbows are reloaded somewhat slower than a bow, they feature an integrated spanning lever, which allows for faster spanning of the bowstring and makes additional spanning tools unnecessary. In the behind the scenes documentaries of the film's Extended Edition, concept artist [[John Howe]] and production designer [[Richard Taylor]] briefly discuss and demonstrate the Uruk crossbow props, made by Weta Workshop. Howe reveals that the inspiration for the crossbow came from an early 16th century design, found in the ''Codex Löffelholz'' manuscript from Germany.<ref>[https://64.media.tumblr.com/d3bf0b6e3be81429b4354a8450931e1e/tumblr_inline_p7gv45UUWO1r7rikj_250.gifv Animated image of Richard Taylor demonstrating the functional Uruk crossbow prop], Weta Workshop featurette, ''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'' Extended Edition</ref><ref>[https://jbc.bj.uj.edu.pl/dlibra/doccontent?id=258834 ''Codex Löffelholz'' in .pdf format at the Jagellonian Bibliotheque] - historical design that inspired the film crossbows by Howe and Weta Workshop</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXli68FbqTE Video demonstrating a professionally reconstructed ''Codex Löffelholz'' crossbow] - the rare historical design that inspired the film's Uruk crossbows</ref>\n\n'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''\n:Uruk crossbowmen are portrayed as a deadly fighting unit.\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':''' \n:Crossbows are available to player characters as handheld ranged weapons.
