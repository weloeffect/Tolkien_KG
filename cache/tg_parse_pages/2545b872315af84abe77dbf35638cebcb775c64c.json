His impatience in waiting for the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] to awake got the best of him and he secretly decided to create the [[Seven Fathers of the Dwarves]]. [[Ilúvatar]] soon learned of Aulë's actions and showed him that the [[Dwarves]] had no free will, as Aulë had no power to create new life. Aulë offered his creation to Ilúvatar and felt they should be destroyed; however, Ilúvatar intervened and granted them life of their own. But he gave Aulë one condition: the Dwarves had to rest until the [[Awakening of the Elves]], whom Eru had chosen to be the Firstborn of his Children.\n\nWhen [[Yavanna]], the spouse of Aulë, learned of her husband's deeds, she feared the Dwarves, or even the [[Elves]] and [[Men]], might harm her [[plants]] and [[trees]] which she loved. She went to [[Manwë]] to seek protection. Manwë spoke with her, and while considering her wishes, he saw the [[Music of the Ainur|Song of Creation]] and remembered the [[Vision of Ilúvatar|Vision]] in which Eru told him not to fear, as spirits would also awake to protect what Yavanna held dear. Thus Manwë proclaimed that the [[Eagles]] will dwell in the mountains, and the [[Ents|Shepherds of the Trees]] will walk in the woods.\n\n==History of the text==\n\n==External links==\n* [http://entmoot.tolkientrail.com/showthread.php?t=6912 Chapter discussion at Entmoot.com]\n* [http://forum.barrowdowns.com/showthread.php?t=13349 Chapter discussion at BarrowDowns.com]\n\n[[fr:tolkien/resumes/silm/qs2]]\n[[fi:Aulë ja Yavanna (Silmarillion)]]\n[[Category:The Silmarillion chapters]]"}}}
