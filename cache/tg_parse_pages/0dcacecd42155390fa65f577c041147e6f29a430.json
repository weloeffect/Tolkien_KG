These were later annexed to [[There and Back Again|his diary]], and the account of the [[War of the Ring]], and (appended with a fifth volume later) formed the [[Red Book of Westmarch]].\n\nAs these were used little by Frodo, and most copies of the Red Book involved mainly the first volume, the ''Translations'' were omitted from other versions. They were preserved only in the [[Thain's Book]], and its copy made by [[Findegil]] in [[Gondor]].<ref name=records>{{FR|Records}}</ref>\n==Inspiration==\nIn the prologue to ''[[The Book of Lost Tales: Part One]]'', [[Christopher Tolkien]] considers that Bilbo's Red Book, and this work, is supposed to be the in-universe origin of the [[Legendarium]] of the Elder Days, specifically ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' that his father was writing. Christopher considered that this scenario obsoleted the earlier conception of [[Ælfwine]], a frame story \"explaining\" how Elvish lore passed to [[Old English]].<ref>{{LT1|Foreword}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Books and documents within the legendarium]]\n[[de:Übersetzungen aus dem Elbischen]]\n[[fr:encyclo/arts/chants et recits/traductions de l elfique]]\n[[fi:Käännöksiä haltiakielestä]]"}}}
