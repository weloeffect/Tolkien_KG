Snow-white! O Lady clear!''' is a song which was sung by a [[Wandering Companies|company]] of [[Elves]], led by [[Gildor|Gildor Inglorion]], as they passed through [[the Shire]] in the late [[Third Age]]. It was overheard by [[Frodo Baggins]], [[Samwise Gamgee]] and [[Peregrin Took]]. Although the elves would have been singing in [[Sindarin]], of which Frodo knew only a little, he was still able to interpret the meaning of the song. Its content is similar to ''[[A Elbereth Gilthoniel]]''. \n\n==Song==\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Snow-white! Snow-white! O Lady clear!.mp3|thumb|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] reads Snow-white! Snow-white!
