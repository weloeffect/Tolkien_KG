It was accessed by traveling from \"Kingstead\" in Western [[Rohan]] through the [[Paths of the Dead]]. [[Tarlang's Neck]] connected the Vale to [[Lamedon]] in the southeast. The Havens of [[Belfalas]] lay to the south, connected by a road that runs through \"Tarlang's Crown\" on the west side of \"Tarlang's Peaks\". The capital was \"Morlad\", built upon a hill on the western shore of the river [[Morthond]], south of the entrance to the [[Dwimorberg]]. Further south along the river were the villages of \"Alagrant\" and \"Sardol\". East of Morlad, on the other side of the [[Hill of Erech]], were the mining village of \"Tingobel\" and the town of \"Lancrath\".\n\n:The Vale faced several threats in March of {{TA|3019}}, during the [[War of the Ring]]. [[Orcs]] of the [[White Mountains]] captured Tingobel, [[Umbar]]rim [[Corsairs of Umbar|Corsairs]] and sorcerors held Tarlang's Crown, and some of the cursed [[Oathbreakers]] had rejected [[Aragorn]]'s offer and reaffirmed their allegiance to [[Sauron]]. These twice-traitorous shades called themselves the Ruthless Dead, and the fear they spread was driving the local fauna to madness and death. \"Malthellam\" was Steward of the Vale in Lord [[Duinhir]]'s absence. He required the cooperation of Duinhir's wife, the Lady Rosfin, but Rosfin blamed him for the loss of Tingobel and was initially reluctant to work with him. The emblem of the Blackroot Vale was a black circle on a white field.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Regions of Gondor]]\n[[Category:Valleys]]\n[[de:Morthondtal]]\n[[fi:Morthondin Laakso]]\n[[fi:Mustanalan Laakso]]"}}}
