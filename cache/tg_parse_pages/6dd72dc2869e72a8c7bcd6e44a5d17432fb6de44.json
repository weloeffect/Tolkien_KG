The Grove was invented for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'' by [[Amazon Studios]].\n\n== History ==\nThe Grove was once a settlement of [[Big Folk]], who possibly planted the gardens before they abandoned the orchard or were wiped out long ago. The Grove eventually became one of the seasonal havens of a tribe of [[Harfoots]] that migrated there in the autumn relying upon fruit that grows there such as carrots and apricots.\n\nDuring the late [[Second Age]], the fruit-trees of the Grove were destroyed by some debris from the eruption of [[Mount Doom|Orodruin]] within the [[Mordor|Southlands]]. Despite this, however, [[The Stranger]] healed the orchard when asked to do so by [[Sadoc Burrows]].\n\nLater, after the Stranger departed the Grove, the [[Mystics]] arrived and used a yellow flower growing on the main tree to pinpoint the direction that the Stranger went. When [[Elanor Brandyfoot]] tried and failed to mislead them, the Dweller plucked a strand of Elanor's hair and burned the Harfoots' carts, she fled after the Stranger with the other Mystics. Yet they were followed by a company of brave Harfoots made up of Sadoc Burrows, [[Marigold Brandyfoot]], Elanor Brandyfoot, and [[Poppy Proudfellow]].\n\nAfter the Mystics were defeated and the company came back to the Grove, the Stranger departed for [[Rhûn]] accompanied by Elanor Brandyfoot while [[Malva Meadowgrass]], [[Vilma]], and the other elders departed the Grove, leading the Harfoot community on a migration to presumably the [[Mirkwood|Old Forest]] for winter.\n\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) locations]]"}}}
