The sound it represents is the vowel ''y'' (not to be confused with the consonantal Quenya ''y'' in ''yulma'')</ref>\n|y\n|}\n\n==History==\nThe history of this mode is not known but the name suggest it evolved in the [[First Age]], on [[Beleriand]], when the [[Noldor]] came to [[Middle-earth]]; we are told that they were forbidden by King [[Thingol|Elu Thingol]] to use Quenya<ref>{{S|Noldor}}</ref> and were forced to adopt [[Sindarin]]. \n\nNormally, they adapted Tengwar to their new language, taking advantage of their inherent flexibility to other sounds, imitating maybe the way the [[Falmari]] of [[Eldamar]] represented the [[Telerin]] sounds that didn't exist in [[Quenya]]. For some obscure reasons we do not know, they found the most usual tehta-mode inappropriate for Sindarin, and they took therefore also example of the original Fëanorian [[Quanta Sarmë]], using distinct tengwar for vowels. \n\nThe Mode of Beleriand seems to have been held \"traditionally\" by the Noldor who were established in [[Eregion]] during the [[Second Age]], as seen on the [[West-gate]] of [[Moria]] Inscription written by [[Celebrimbor]].<ref>{{FR|Journey}}</ref> After Eregion was destroyed in {{SA|1697}}, the Noldor migrated to [[Rivendell|Imladris]],<ref>{{App|B}}</ref> where the Mode of Beleriand was perhaps used even till the [[Third Age]].<ref>''[[The Road Goes Ever On, A Song Cycle]]''</ref>\n\n==Structure==\nIt seems that Sindarin speakers found use only for 3 of the 5 [[témar]] since Sindarin lacked the palatalized (''ly, ny, ty'') sounds of Quenya as well as the labialized ''qu''.\n\n===Vowels===\nOf the [[Quessetéma]], [[Vilya (word)|Wilya]] was used for a final -''u'' (or -''w''). There is also an ''a''-tengwa called [[Osse]], not corresponding with any of the older ones known from Quenya; it could have been imported from a Quenya semivowel unknown to us, which belonged to the Quanta-Sarme.\n\nThe carriers took vowel values too: The [[telco]] was used for ''i'', while the long carrier could have been used for the semiconsonantal initial sound ''y-'' (or ''i-'' as in ''Ioreth'').<ref name=\"KL\">This is the usage in the [[King's Letter]] which employs a similar mode</ref>\n\nDiphthongs were expressed by tehtar. Two [[amatixi]] (maybe a remnant of the earlier [[Tyelpetéma]]), used for -''i'' in the diphthongs ''ai'', ''ei'' and ''ui''.<ref>''ei'' and ''ui'' are each attested in the [[Doors of Durin]] and [[A Elbereth Gilthoniel]] texts respectively</ref> ''Au'' (spelled -''aw'' at the end of words) is not attested, but perhaps similarly the [[w-tehta|''w''-tehta]] was used (''[[caun]]'', {{tg|mode=smith|a]é6}}). \n\n''ae'', although a diphthong, is attested written with the separate letters for ''a'' and ''e'', and maybe the same applies to the diphthong ''oe'' too.\n\n===Labialised consonants===\nIn Quenya mode, labialised consonants (''kw'', ''ngw'' etc) belonged to the Quessetéma. It's possible that the Mode of Beleriand used a [[w-tehta|''w''-tehta]] {{tg|mode=smith|è}} over consonants for this (''[[edwen]]'', would perhaps be written here as {{tg|mode=smith|l2èl6}}).<ref name=\"KL\"/>\n\n===Nasalization===\n[[Anto]], [[Ampa]] and other letters used for nasalized stops in Quenya took different values. A tilde is used before stops for nasalisation. (''mb'', {{tg|mode=smith|wP}})\n\n===Length===\nA well-known tehta that indicates long consonants, the under-tilde, was not used. Long ''m'' and ''n'' were written with [[Malta]] and Númen (i.e., doubling of the [[lúva]]), and other long consonants were written with two letters (''[[mellon]]'', {{tg|mode=smith|yljjh6}}).\n\nA tehta was used to indicate long vowels, an acute accent called [[Andaith]] (''á'', {{tg|mode=smith|]R}})\n\n== Examples ==\nThe best known sample of the Mode of Beleriand is of course the Inscription of the [[West-gate]] of Moria, written by Celebrimbor of Eregion; this suggest that this Mode was preserved there by the Noldor.\n\n<blockquote>\n{{tg|mode=smith|- l5I6 2.7`6 ]7]6 yh7`] - ql2h yljjh6 ] y`5h -\n<br>\n- `y 6]7r` 9]Ö6 ld]1p - aljlw7`wPh7 h l7ls`h6 1lÕ3]1p ` 3`Vn 9`6 -}}</p>\n\n<p>Ennyn Durin Aran Moria.

Imladris was inhabited by the refugees of Eregion<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref> and is one of the places that might have kept the Mode of Beleriand, even in the 3rd Age. \n{|\n| {{tg|mode=smith|] ljwl7l3 s`j3h6`lj}}\n| ''A Elbereth Gilthoniel \n|-\n| {{tg|mode=smith|8`j`r7l6 ql5] 6`V7`lj}}\n| ''silivren penna míriel\n|-\n| {{tg|mode=smith|h yl6lj ]sj]7 ljl6]3}}\n| ''o menel aglar elenath!\n|-\n| {{tg|mode=smith|6]d]l7l2 q]j]62`V7`lj}}\n| ''Na-chaered palan-díriel\n|-\n| {{tg|mode=smith|h s]j]47lt`6 l5h7]3}}\n| ''o galadhremmin ennorath, \n|-\n| {{tg|mode=smith|e]6.Öjh8 jl j5]3h6}}\n| ''Fanuilos, le linnathon\n|-\n| {{tg|mode=smith|6lr ]l]7 8`V 6lr ]l]7h6}}\n| ''nef aear, sí nef aearon!\n|}\n\n{{References|n}}\n{{languages}}\n[[Category:Tengwar]]"}}}
