Gathered there was the host of [[Fingon]], hidden from the eyes of [[Morgoth]]; and all were jubilant when they were joined by a force from hidden [[Gondolin]] led by [[Turgon]], Fingon's brother.\n\nThe host of Fingon were to await a beacon signal from [[Maedhros]] before they joined the battle so that they might outflank the enemy forces, but Morgoth sent a force to come upon Fingon's and keep the armies divided. The horde led by a [[Captain of Morgoth]] could only goad Fingon's force into battle by killing the elf [[Gelmir (son of Guilin)|Gelmir]] whom they had captured at the [[Dagor Bragollach]]. Gelmir's brother, [[Gwindor]], was present with Fingon and was so enraged that he initiated the charge and Fingon's force entered the battle earlier than planned.\n[[File:Alan Lee - The Battle of Unnumbered Tears.jpg|left|thumb|''The Battle of Unnumbered Tears'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]\nSuch was the force of this initial attack that they reached the very doors of [[Angband]]; but Gwindor was captured. Fingon was then beaten back across the plain by the main host of Morgoth's forces that issued from many secret tunnels. So did the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] begin.\n\nTo support his brother, Turgon brought his force into the fray, and Fingon, Húrin, Huor and Turgon met in the midst of the battle after long partings. But with the force of Maedhros routed, more [[Orcs]] led by [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]] came upon the elves and men from the east, and they were outmatched.\n\nFingon fell to Gothmog, but Turgon, on the advice of Huor, retreated, guarded by the remnants of the House of Hador. There at the [[Fen of Serech]], Huor fell, but Húrin was captured alive at great loss to the enemy; and he was dragged to Angband.\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Battle of Unnumbered Tears}}\n[[Category:The Children of Húrin chapters]]\n[[fi:Lukemattomien kyynelten taistelu (HLT)]]"}}}
