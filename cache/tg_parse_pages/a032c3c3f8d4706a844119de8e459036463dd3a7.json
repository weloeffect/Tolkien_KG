The song, sung by [[Glenn Yarbrough]], is never actually featured anywhere in the [[1977]] [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|film adaptation]].\n\n==Lyrics==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nI met an old, fat [[Spiders|spider]],\nSpinning in his tree.\nI said, \"Hey old, fat spider, \nI bet you can't catch me!\nYou've grown too fat you lazy lob.\nYou're just an old Tomnoddy!\nHey Attercop!\nHey Attercop!\nYou can't catch anybody.\"\n\nAnd then the old, fat spider,\nHe spun a final thread.\nI said, \"Hey old, fat spider,\nIt's time that you were dead!\"\nI drew [[Sting|my sword]] to cut his silk,\nTo kill the old Tomnoddy. \nBut then I thought, I'll leave him be;\nHe can't catch anybody.\n\nI met an old fat spider\nIn his spinning tree.\nHis web all old and tattered,\nAnd he could hardly see.\nI shooed a [[Flies|fly]] into his lair\nTo feed the old Tomnoddy.\n'Cause how can you kill a spider who can't catch anybody?\nHow can you kill a spider who can't catch anybody?\n\nI met an old, fat spider\nIn his spinning tree.\nHis web all old and tattered,\nAnd he could hardly see.\nI shooed a fly into his lair\nTo feed the old Tomnoddy.\n'Cause how can you kill a spider who can't catch anybody?\nHow can you kill a spider who can't catch anybody?\n</poem>\n\n[[Category:The Hobbit (1977 film) soundtrack]]"}}}
