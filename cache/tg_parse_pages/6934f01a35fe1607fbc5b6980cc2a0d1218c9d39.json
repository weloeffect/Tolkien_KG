At the same time Orcs descended upon the Wold from the [[Misty Mountains]] in the west. The [[Ruling Steward]] [[Cirion]] sent messengers north to seek aid and then led Gondor's northern army to repel the invaders. This army had been driven into the [[Field of Celebrant]] and was facing annihilation when [[Eorl|Eorl the Young]] and his mounted host burst upon the rear of the enemy. The invaders fled across the Limlight and were hunted by Eorl's riders across the Wold.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>\n\n===Rohan===\nIt was after that victory when Calenardhon, including the Wold, was given to Eorl's people and became an independent kingdom. However, in {{TA|2545|n}} [[Easterlings]] once more attempted to invade the area and King [[Eorl]] of the [[Rohirrim]] fell in battle in the Wold.<ref name=\"TA\">{{App|TA}}</ref>\n\nThe main inhabitants were nomadic Men of Rohan who used the land to graze cattle, although during the years up to the [[War of the Ring]] the land had become deserted due to [[Orcs|orc-raids]].<ref name=River/>\n\nIn [[July]] {{TA|3018|n}} the [[Nazgûl]] passed northward across the Wold as they began searching for the land of the [[Hobbits]].
