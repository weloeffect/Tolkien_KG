When Sméagol took a break to nose about the banks, a great fish pulled Déagol to the bottom of the water. Upon seeing something gleaming in the river-bed, he abandoned his fishing equipment and seized the gleaming object. When he swam out, ''\"with weeds in his hair and a handful of mud\"'', he saw that what he discovered was a ''\"[[the One Ring|beautiful golden ring]]\"''.[[File:Cor Blok - Sméagol and Déagol.jpeg|thumb|200px|left|\"[[Gollum|Sméagol]] and Déagol\" by [[Cor Blok]]]] Yet, as he gloated over his finding, Sméagol watched him from nearby and silently approached him, desiring the ring.

While fishing in the [[Anduin|Great River Anduin]] with [[Gollum|Sméagol]], he is pulled into the water by a large fish attatched to his rod. He lets go of his rod and spots [[The One Ring|a ring]] at the bottom. He takes it back to the surface and rubs it on his body, enamored by its beauty. Sméagol asks him for the Ring because \"its my birthday, my love, and I wants it\". Déagol tells him he has already given him more than he could afford and that he will keep the Ring because he found it. Gollum asks \"will you indeed, my love?\" and strangles Déagol to death, taking the ring for himself. \n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''\n:Déagol is played by [[New Zealand]] actor [[Thomas Robins]].<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0992718/bio|articlename=Biography for Thomas Robins|dated=|website=[http://www.imdb.com/ IMDB]|accessed=30 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n| race=hobbit\n| died=c. {{TA|2463}}\n}}\n{{seq\n| pvac=Vacant\n| prev=Last held by:<br/>[[Isildur]], c. 2461 years earlier\n| list=[[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]]\n| dates=briefly, c. {{TA|2463}}\n| next=[[Gollum|Sméagol]]\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n\n{{References}}\n\n{{Ringbearers}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Deagol}}\n[[Category:Stoors]]\n[[Category:Ring-bearers]]\n[[de:Déagol]]\n[[fr:encyclo:personnages:hobbits:deagol]]\n[[fi:Déagol]]\n[[Category:Hobbits]]"}}}
