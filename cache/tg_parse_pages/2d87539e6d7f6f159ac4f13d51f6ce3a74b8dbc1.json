Tolkien]] wrote '''[[Letters not published in The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien|a letter]] to Mrs L.M. Cutts'''.<ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 535</ref>\n\n* '''Description:''' 3 pages letter.\n* '''Publication:''' ''[[Sotheby's English Literature, History, Fine Bindings, Private Press Books, Children's Books, Illustrated Books and Drawings 10 July 2003]]''. A description of the letter was found on the web site of Sotheby's.<ref>[http://www.sothebys.com/app/live/lot/LotDetail.jsp?lot_id=42MCG Item description on the web site of Sotheby's]</ref>\n\n==Description and excerpts==\n\nApologising for the cost of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien notes that the book ''\"cost a v. great deal to produce (about £4,000 pounds), and the publisher deserves to make some profit on what was, for him, a very risky adventure, the success of which has, I think, surprised him as much as anyone (except, perhaps, me myself)...\"''\n\nDiscussing sources for the work, the author states ''\"I did no study or research for my tale. It is an 'invention' from beginning to end... If it is 'English' - (not British, please) - that is because I am English...\"'' However, Tolkien notes his ''\"professional calling as a philologist\"'' and that his study of ''\"early English\"'' has been ''\"digested\"''. Noting that analysis would be ''\"very complex\"'' he also suggests it would be ''\"...not (in my opinion) worth while...\"'' Tolkien states his belief that ''\"no one of us can really invent or 'create' in a void, we can only reconstruct and perhaps impress a personal pattern on 'ancestral' material...''\n\nTolkien then discusses names ''(\"...I invented the word hobbit, and can say no more about it than it seemed to me to fit the creatures that I had already in mind... or rather it generated them: they grew to fit it...\")'' and discusses connections between the Ents, Great Birnam Wood in Macbeth, and [[George MacDonald|George MacDonald's]] ''Phantastes''. Tolkien notes the origin of \"barrow\" and states ''\"the belief that 'undead' physically potent creatures abode in grave-mounds is ancient...\"'' The author then discusses the origin of the name Gandalf.\n\nConcluding, Tolkien notes that ''\"...if I may say so, with humility, the [[Christianity|Christian religion]] (which I profess) is far the most powerful ultimate source. On a lower plane: my linguistic interest is the most powerful force...\"''\n\n3 pages (\"air letter aerogramme\" stationery) with 1 page of address panel, 8vo, 76 Sandfield Road, Oxford, 26 October 1958, creases and minimal spotting.\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Letters|Cutts, L.M.]]"}}}
