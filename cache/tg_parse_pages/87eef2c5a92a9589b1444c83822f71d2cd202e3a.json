Due to its location, it was called the '''Last Homely House''' from the point of view of a traveller going to the [[Misty Mountains]] and [[Wilderland]]; and also the '''First Homely House''' from the point of view of someone coming from these lands to the civilised lands of Eriador to the west.\n\nIt was established by [[Elrond]] in {{SA|1697}} as a refuge from [[Sauron]] after the [[Sack of Eregion|Fall of Eregion]].<ref name=\"SA\">{{App|SA}}</ref> It remained Elrond's seat throughout the remainder of the Second Age and until the end of the Third Age, when he took the [[White Ship]] for [[Valinor]]. Rivendell had a strong alliance with the [[Kings of Arnor]] and after the fall of [[Arthedain]], it became a refuge for the [[Rangers of the North]] and the [[Heir of Isildur]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Soni Alcorn-Hender - Valley of Rivendell.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Valley of Rivendell'' by [[Soni Alcorn-Hender]]]]\nRivendell was located at the edge of a narrow gorge of the [[Bruinen|Bruinen River]],<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref> but well hidden in the moorlands and foothills of the [[Misty Mountains]].<ref name=\"Rest\">{{H|Rest}}</ref>\n\nPine-trees grew on the top of the valley, and there was a \"steep zig-zag path\" to the valley bottom. The vegetation in the valley bottom was mostly oak and beech.<ref name=\"Rest\" />\n\n==History==\n===Second Age===\n====Foundation====\nDuring the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]], and as [[Sauron]] was moving against Eriador, Elrond led an army of [[Elves of Lindon]] to the region. They arrived late but were joined by a detachment out of [[Eregion]] led by [[Celeborn]]. Despite this, Sauron's armies overwhelmed the Elves, and Elrond was unable to reach Eregion. Forced northward toward the headwaters of [[Bruinen]], Elrond established a stronghold.<ref name=\"SA\" />\n\nThis became a refuge for those seeking shelter from Sauron's onslaught in Eriador, and Elrond's and Celeborn's Elves were soon joined by many fleeing the [[Sack of Eregion]]. More came as Sauron ravaged Eriador on his march toward [[Lindon]]. By {{SA|1700}}, Sauron had overrun all of Eriador and Imladris was [[First Siege of Imladris|besieged]]. The siege ended when Gil-galad's forces, strengthened by the armament sent by [[Tar-Minastir]], routed Sauron's armies and drove him out of Eriador.\n\nA Council held at that time made Elrond Gil-galad's vice-regent in Eriador, and Imladris his seat. Gil-galad bestowed [[Vilya]] upon Elrond in secret. Aided by the power of the [[Three Rings|Elven ring]], Elrond made Imladris one of the chief seats of Elvish strength in the west in the latter part of the Second Age. Imladris remained an Elvish stronghold in Eriador to the end of the Second Age and into the Third.<ref>{{UT|6}}</ref>\n\n====Last Alliance====\nAt the end of the Second Age, [[Elendil]] and Gil-galad formed the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] to challenge Sauron, and their host halted for a while at Imladris in {{SA|3431}} and they stayed there for 3 years, gathered their forces before crossing the Misty Mountains.<ref name=\"SA\" /><ref name=\"SV\" /> \n\n[[Isildur]]'s wife and his youngest son, [[Valandil (King of Arnor)|Valandil]], were in Imladris at that time, and Isildur was journeying back to them after Sauron's defeat when he was ambushed at the [[Gladden Fields]].<ref>{{UT|7}}</ref> After receiving the shards of [[Narsil]], Valandil took up his role as King of [[Arnor]] and left Imladris for [[Annúminas]].<ref name=\"SV\">{{S|V}}</ref>\n\n===Third Age===\nAfter the fall of Gil-galad, Elrond remained in Imladris. During the Third Age, it was a refuge and sanctuary; many Elves gathered there, and it was the chief dwelling of the [[High Elves]] in Eriador, except the [[Elves of Lindon]], but also wise and powerful people of all the races. Most of the Elves who lived in Rivendell were High Elves.<ref>{{RGEO|Notes}}, p. 64</ref> The [[Heir of Isildur|Heirs of Isildur]] were also harboured there due to their kinship with Elrond, as descendants of his brother [[Elros]].<ref name=\"SV\" />\n\nDanger came to Eriador around {{TA|1300}} when [[Angmar]] was established in the north-east beyond the [[Ettenmoors]]. It was late in the reign of [[Arveleg I]] that [[Second Siege of Imladris|Rivendell was besieged by Angmar]]. After an incursion by Angmar into Eriador in {{TA|1409}}, the Elves of Rivendell joined [[Elves of Lindon|those of Lindon]] and the [[Galadhrim]], whom Elrond brought over the Mountains, in subduing the power of the [[Witch-king]] for many years.<ref name=\"eriador\">{{App|Eriador}}</ref>\n\nAfter the end of the North-kingdom in {{TA|1975}} [[Aranarth]], the first [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain|Chieftain of the Dúnedain]], had [[Arahael|his son]] fostered in Rivendell, as were all subsequent sons of the chieftains. The heirlooms and treasures of the house of Isildur, including the shards of [[Narsil]], were also kept there after [[Arvedui]]'s death.<ref name=\"SV\" /> Among these were also some of the few remaining documents containing the history of Númenor.<ref>{{UT|3}}</ref>\n[[File:J.R.R.

Several other Elves, [[Dwarves]] and [[Men]] had also arrived at Rivendell on separate errands;<ref name=\"Meetings\" /> at the [[Council of Elrond]] they learned that all of their errands were related to the fate of [[the One Ring]], and they had to decide what to do about it. In the end, the Hobbits influenced the decision.<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the destruction of [[the One Ring]] at the end of the Third Age, Elrond's ring lost its power, and Elrond, with many of his household, left Rivendell to sail for [[Valinor]] from the [[Grey Havens]]; this marked the start of the [[Fourth Age]]. \n\n===Later history===\nAlthough Elrond departed from Rivendell, [[Elladan and Elrohir]] remained for a while with some of the remaining [[Noldor]].<ref name=\"Prologue\">{{FR|Prologue}}</ref> It is believed that [[Celeborn]] also relocated to Rivendell after the departure of [[Galadriel]] and having also grown weary of [[East Lórien]].<ref name=\"Prologue\" /><ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>\n\nIt is not known when Rivendell was finally abandoned, but shortly before [[Aragorn]] died in {{FoA|120}}, he said to [[Arwen]] that \"none now walk\" in the garden of Elrond, indicating that the last of the [[Noldor]] had departed to [[Valinor]].<ref name=\"Tale\" />\n\n==Etymology==\n''Rivendell'' (\"[[Wiktionary:cloven|cloven]]-[[Wiktionary:dell|dell]]\") is the [[Westron|Common Speech]] translation of the [[Sindarin]] name '''''Imladris''''' (\"deep dale of the cleft\").<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 774</ref> The name ''Imladris'' is also glossed as \"flat-floored valley of the Cleft\"<ref name=\"letter\">[[J.R.R.
