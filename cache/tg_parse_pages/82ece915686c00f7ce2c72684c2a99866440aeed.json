The lamps were filled with light by [[Varda]], hallowed by [[Manwë]] and set on great pillars, taller than any mountains of the later days.\n\n* Illuin was set in the north of Middle-earth, placed upon the tower [[Helcar]]<ref name=LT1>{{LT1|III}}</ref> and shone with a blue light.\n* Ormal was set in the far south, placed upon the tower [[Ringil (tower)|Ringil]]<ref name=LT1/> and shone with a golden light.\n\nIn the centre of [[Middle-earth]], where the light of the Two Lamps mingled and the vegetation of [[Yavanna]] was richer, was the [[Great Lake]] and the island [[Almaren]], where the Valar first dwelt. The light of the Lamps of the Valar flowed out over the Earth, so that all was lit as it were in a changeless day.<ref name=Days>{{S|Days}}</ref>\n\nHowever Melkor was aware of all that was done for he had spies among the Maiar. Whilst the Valar feasted and [[Tulkas]] slept Melkor came forth suddenly to war and striking the first blow against the lights of Illuin and Ormal, cast down the mighty pillars and broke the Two Lamps. \n\nIt was due to the destruction of the pillars that the lands were broken and new seas arose; the shape of Arda and the symmetry of its waters and its lands were marred so that the first designs of the Valar were never after restored.<ref name=Days/> The great northern inland sea of [[Sea of Helcar|Helcar]] was formed as a result of the destruction of Illuin and it is believed that the [[Sea of Ringil]] to the south was formed from the fall of Ormal.\n\nWith the Two Lamps gone and their dwellings on Almaren destroyed the Valar retreated to [[Aman]] and founded [[Valinor]]. There they would go on to create the [[Two Trees of Valinor|Two Trees]], which were a pair of gold and silver light, similar to the Two Lamps before them.\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n[[Christopher Tolkien]] noted that the story of the Lamps in its early stage was very different from the published ''[[Silmarillion]]''.  \nAccording to older writings not used in the published ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', the Valar wanted peace with Melkor, and decided to ask his assistance: they wished to fix the lamps upon Arda's ground. Melkor, black with hate and envy of the rest of the Valar, agreed to help. He gave Aulë a substance which was both sturdy and strong: ice, which was unknown to the Valar. Melkor bided his time and allowed the Valar to do as they wished until the fateful day when the Lamps' light and heat melted the ice and crashed upon Arda, flooding it with water and darkness.\n\nThe one remaining influence from the older version of the story was that the fall of the towers created inland seas, a vestige of the notion that the towers had been made of ice that melted.<ref>{{LT1|IIIn}}, p. 87</ref>\nIn Tolkien's latest writings where Arda was a [[Round World version of the Silmarillion|round world]] from its beginning, the Two Lamps never truly existed and were instead a subject of Númenórean mythology.<ref>{{MR|Myths}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Images of the Two Lamps|Images of the Two Lamps]]\n\n{{references}}\n{{cosmology}}\n\n[[fr:/encyclo/artefacts/lampes/lampes_des_valar]]\n[[fi:Valarin Lamput]]\n[[Category:Creations of the Valar]]"}}}
