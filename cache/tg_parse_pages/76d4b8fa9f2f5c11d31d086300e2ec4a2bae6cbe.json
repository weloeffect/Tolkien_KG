The independent 4-volume set was first published in [[1998]], and it was republished in [[2002]], by HarperCollins.\n\nIt documents the writing of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', except for the [[The Lord of the Rings Foreword|Foreword]], the [[Prologue (The Lord of the Rings)|Prologue]] and the [[Appendices]] (which came later in ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]''). Other early versions, drafts and schemes (including the only complete scheme of the entire book) have been published in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]''.\n\nThe idea of separating the four volumes from ''The History of Middle-earth'' came first from the Spanish edition in [[1993]], which was made with consent by Christopher Tolkien.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), ''El Retorno de la Sombra'', \"Nota del Editor\", p. 5</ref>\n\n==Volumes and contents==\n* I. '''''[[The Return of the Shadow]]''''' ([[1988]]) begins with the initial composition, and goes through to the [[Khazad-dûm|Mines of Moria]].\n\n* II. '''''[[The Treason of Isengard]]''''' ([[1989]]) continues to the meeting with [[Théoden]].\n\n* III. '''''[[The War of the Ring]]''''' ([[1990]]) continues to the opening of the [[Morannon|Black Gate]].\n\n* IV. '''''[[The End of the Third Age]]''''' ([[1998]]) finishes the story.\n** This is significantly shorter than its ''The History of Middle-earth'' counterpart, '''''[[Sauron Defeated]]''''' ([[1992]]), as it omits ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]'' and ''[[The Drowning of Anadûnê]]''.\n\nIn general, the books are organized as chapters corresponding to the chapters in the final ''The Lord of the Rings'', with additional chapters describing the \"[[The First Map of The Lord of the Rings|First Map]]\", the \"[[The Second Map of The Lord of the Rings|Second Map]]\", and other matters. Each chapter begins with some context, then the text of a first or second draft, possibly some alternate drafts if there were especially large changes, and interspersed with extended discussion of confusing  or contradictory situations. The end of each chapter includes a set of notes about points of interest, such as words that were used originally and then partially erased or struck out.\n\n==Book titles==\nThe titles of the volumes derive from discarded titles for the separate books of ''The Lord of the Rings''. J.R.R. Tolkien conceived the work as a single volume comprising six \"books\" plus extensive appendices, but the [[George Allen & Unwin|original publisher]] split the work into three, publishing two books per volume with the appendices included in the third.\n\nThe titles proposed by Tolkien for the six books were:\n* [[The Fellowship of the Ring#Book I|Book 1]] — ''The First Journey'' or ''The Ring Sets Out''\n* [[The Fellowship of the Ring#Book II|Book 2]] — ''The Journey of the Nine Companions'' or ''The Ring Goes South''\n* [[The Two Towers#Book III|Book 3]] — ''The Treason of Isengard''\n* [[The Two Towers#Book IV|Book 4]] — ''The Journey of the Ring-Bearers'' or ''The Ring Goes East''\n* [[The Return of the King#Book V|Book 5]] — ''The War of the Ring''\n* [[The Return of the King#Book VI|Book 6]] — ''The End of the Third Age''\n\nThe title ''The Return of the Shadow'' was a discarded title for Volume 1 — ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.\n\nThree of the titles were also used as book titles for the seven-volume edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'': ''The Treason of Isengard'' for Book 3, ''The War of the Ring'' for Book 5, and ''The End of the Third Age'' for Book 6.\n\n==Publication history and gallery==\n;UK Editions\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"126px\" heights=\"125px\">\nFile:History of The Lord of the Rings 1998.jpeg|1998 boxed set\nFile:History of The Lord of the Rings 2002.jpg|2002 boxed set\n</gallery>\n*[[HarperCollins]] boxed set ([[1998]]), ISBN 0261103709\n*[[HarperCollins]] boxed set ([[2002]]), ISBN 0261103709\n\n==See also==\n*''[[The History of The Hobbit]]''\n\n{{References}}\n{{home}}\n{{title|italics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History of The Lord of the Rings}}\n[[Category:Books by J.R.R.
