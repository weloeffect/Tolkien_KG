It expands the world by opening up the West [[Rohan]] region, including the city of [[Edoras]], from the [[Gap of Rohan]] south and east towards the [[Eastfold]]. It also introduced expansions to gameplay through the Big Battles system (the first of which being the expansion's namesake), raising the level cap to 95, class changes, and the extension of the epic story. It marked the last large paid expansion Turbine would release for three years, instead opting to release quarterly free updates with bonuses for VIP subscribers.\n\n==Storyline==\n===Volume III: Allies of the King===\n*'''Book XI - The Golden Hall'''\n*'''Book XII - War in the Westemnet'''\n*'''Book XIII - The Battle of the Hornburg'''\n<!-- summaries needed -->\n\n==Updates==\n===Update 13: The Breaking of Isengard===\n''The Breaking of Isengard'' is the thirteenth update and was released [[14 April]], [[2014]].<ref name=\"Update 13\">{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://forums-old.lotro.com/forums/showthread.php?546315-Update-13-The-Breaking-of-Isengard-%E2%80%93-Official-release-Notes|articlename=Update 13: The Breaking of Isengard – Official release Notes|dated=|website=LOTRO|accessed=27 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n'''Book XIV - The Waters of Isengard'''\n<!-- summary needed -->\n\n*Release of a new landscape consisting of post-[[Battle of Isengard]] Nan Curunir as well as the Entwood,<ref name=\"Update 13\"/> an area consisting of the south-western part of Fangorn.\n*The fourteenth and final book of Epic Volume III: Allies of the King, The Waters of Isengard.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://www.lotro.com/en/game/articles/dev-diary-%E2%80%93-update-13-quest-notes|articlename=Dev Diary – Update 13 Quest Notes|dated=|website=LOTRO|accessed=27 July 2015}}</ref>\n*Misty Mountains, North Downs and Trollshaws region revamps.<ref name=\"Update 13\"/>\n*Resizable inventory bags.<ref name=\"Update 13\"/>\n*Level scaling from level 20 up for players in the Ettenmoors and temporary Ettenmoors passes for free-to-play purchasable with Mithril Coins.<ref name=\"Update 13\"/>\n\n===Update 14: Paths of the Dead===\n''Paths of the Dead'' is the fourteenth update and was released [[14 July]], [[2014]].<ref name=\"Update 14\">{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://forums-old.lotro.com/forums/showthread.php?552272-Update-14-Paths-of-the-Dead-Release-Notes-amp-Known-Issues|articlename=Update 14: Paths of the Dead - Release Notes & Known Issues |dated=|website=LOTRO|accessed=27 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n'''Volume IV: The Strength of Sauron'''\n'''Book I - The Road to Gondor'''\n<!-- summary needed -->\n\n*Release of the West Gondor region, consisting of the areas the [[Paths of the Dead]], the [[Blackroot Vale]], [[Lamedon]], the Havens of [[Belfalas]], and [[Dol Amroth]].<ref name=\"Update 14\"/><ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.lotro.com/en/u14|articlename=Update 14: Paths of the Dead Now Available|dated=|website=LOTRO|accessed=27 July 2015}}</ref>\n*A new Epic series,<ref name=\"Update 14\"/> Volume IV: The Strength of Sauron, beginning with Book 1: The Road to Gondor.\n*The Essence System, allowing specially slotted armors to be fitted with a variety of Essences for customizable stats.<ref name=\"Update 14\"/>\n*Level cap increase to 100.<ref name=\"Update 14\"/>\n*The [[Dead Marshes]] region was added later in the minor Update 14.2, released September 15, 2014.
