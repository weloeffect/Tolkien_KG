The Rangers travelled freely southwards and eastwards of the village of Bree as far as the [[Misty Mountains]]. In the days of the [[War of the Ring]] no other [[Men]] than the Bree-folk had settled dwellings so far west as Bree or within a hundred leagues of the Shire. When the Rangers appeared in Bree, the locals eagerly listened to the news that they brough from far away or to their strange forgotten tales, but they did not make friends with the Rangers. The Bree-folk belived that the Rangers had strange powers to hear and see things and to understand the languages of birds and beasts.<ref name=\"Sign\">{{FR|Sign}}, p. 149</ref>\n\nThe Rangers who joined [[Aragorn]] in [[Rohan]] were dressed in dark grey cloaks with a cloak-clasp shaped like a rayed star and hoods that covered their helms. They were armed with spears, bows and swords.<ref>{{RK|Company}}, p. 778</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Men of Arnor}}\nThe Dúnedain of Arnor dwindled after the breaking of Arnor into three kingdoms and the wars with [[Angmar]]. [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]] soon fell and only the petty-kingdom of [[Arthedain]] maintained the noble line of [[Isildur]]. Finally, that too was destroyed in the [[Battle of Fornost]] and [[Arvedui]], the last King of Arthedain was lost in the sea.\n\nArvedui's son and heir, [[Aranarth]] claimed the title of the [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain|Chieftain]], who would rule the remnants of his people. [[Elrond]] had in his keeping the heirlooms of the [[House of Isildur]]: the shards of [[Narsil]], the [[Star of Elendil]], the [[Sceptre of Annúminas]] and later the [[Ring of Barahir]], ransomed from the [[Lossoth]]. Each of Aranarth's heirs (who, like him, could trace his descent [[Heir of Isildur|back to Isildur himself]]) would be secretly born and raised in [[Rivendell]].\n\nAfter the kingdom of Arthedain had ended, the Dúnedain of the North went into the shadows and turned into a secret and wandering people.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, p. 1043</ref> During the reign of [[Arador]], the fourteenth [[Chieftain of the Dúnedain]], the house of the Chieftain was located in woods near the [[Hoarwell]] north of the [[Trollshaws]] and many Dúnedain of the North lived in the woods [[Angle|between]] the river Hoarwell and the river [[Bruinen|Loudwater]].<ref name=NM>{{NM|P3xvii}}, note 12, p. 366</ref> One of them, [[Dírhael]], the grandfather of Aragorn, lived with his wife [[Ivorwen]] in a hidden fastnesses in the wilds of Eriador.<ref>{{PM|Aii}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[Watchful Peace]] followed the loss of Arnor and after its end, the enemies concentrated mostly against  [[Rhovanion]] and [[Gondor]]. During that time, the Rangers fought minor battles and skirmishes against [[orcs]] and [[wolves]] in order to keep the region safe. The [[hobbits]] of [[the Shire]] flourished under their protection.\n\nDuring the rule of [[Arassuil]], the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] became more bold, daring to invade Eriador. The Rangers fought many battles trying to hold them back, but one party managed to reach the Shire, and were fought off by a party of brave Hobbits under [[Bandobras Took]]<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, entry for Chieftain Arassuil, p. 1043</ref> in {{TA|2747}}.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2747, p. 1088</ref> Soon after, the [[Long Winter]] arrived and many lives were lost. [[Gandalf]] came to the aid of the Hobbits.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2758, p. 1088</ref> \n[[File:Steamey - After the death of Arathorn.jpg|thumb|''After the death of Arathorn'' by [[:Category:Images by Steamey|Steamey]]]]\nIn {{TA|2911|n}}, during [[Argonui]]'s rule,<ref>{{App|South}}, ''Chieftains'', entries for Arathorn I and Argonui, p. 1038</ref> the [[Fell Winter (Third Age)|Fell Winter]] began with the [[Brandywine]] freezing over. This was a catalyst for [[White Wolves]] invading Eriador from the North. In the following year, great floods devastated [[Enedwaith]] and [[Minhiriath]] leaving [[Tharbad]] ruined and deserted.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entries for the years 2911 and 2912, p. 1089</ref> The following years were peaceful although [[Arador]] was killed by [[hill-trolls]] and his son [[Arathorn II]] was killed while hunting orcs.<ref name=tale>{{App|Tale}}, p. 1057</ref>\n\nArathorn's son, [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]] succeeded him, who between {{TA|2957|n}} to {{TA|2980|n}} took great journeys, serving in the armies of King [[Thengel]] of [[Rohan]], and Steward [[Ecthelion II]] of Gondor. Many of his tasks weakened [[Sauron]] and his allies.\n\n[[Saruman]], jealous of Gandalf, secretly followed Gandalf's interest for the Hobbits and put spies in Bree and Southfarthing. In the years leading up to the [[War of the Ring]], his spies saw that the Shire was closely guarded by the Rangers. When Gandalf suspected that Bilbo Baggins possessed the [[One Ring]] the guard was doubled (perhaps at his request to Chieftain [[Aragorn]]). He also asked Aragorn to locate [[Gollum]].<ref>{{App|TA}}, entries for the years ''c. '' 3000 and 3001, p. 1090</ref>\n\nAt that time Aragorn's Rangers were scattered and diminished. When [[Halbarad]] led a [[Grey Company|troop]] of the Rangers into the south to Aragorn's aid in the War, in haste he could muster no more than thirty in this company who fought in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields|Battle of Pelennor Fields]].\n\nAragorn eventually became King Elessar of the [[Reunited Kingdom]] and the Rangers became once more a united people under the line of [[Elendil]] in the [[Fourth Age]].\n\n== Portrayal in adaptations ==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings War in the North - Rangers of the North.jpg|300px|thumb|Rangers of the North in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]''.]]'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Rangers of the North are called simply Rangers in the game. There were some scattered about Middle-earth, but there were also many who were organized. There was a group that [[Aragorn]] led to keep track of the Enemy's movement during \"Stirrings in the Darkness\". The main Ranger factions in the game are the Rangers of [[Esteldín]], the Wardens of [[Annúminas]], and later they merge into the [[Grey Company]].\n\n'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''\n:The Rangers of the North first appear in the Prologue of the game.
