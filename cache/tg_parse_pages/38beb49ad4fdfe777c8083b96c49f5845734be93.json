He was the father of [[Frodo Baggins]].\n\n==History==\nDrogo Baggins was the second child, and oldest son, of [[Fosco Baggins]] and [[Ruby Bolger]], born in {{SR|1308}}. He married [[Primula Brandybuck]], and had one child, [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]].<ref>{{App|Baggins}}</ref> \n\nA regular and respectable [[Shire-hobbit]], fond of good food, he often visited his generous father-in-law [[Gorbadoc Brandybuck]] in [[Brandy Hall]], and seemed to adopt the curious customs of the [[Bucklanders]], like boating. This was the cause of his irregular death, as during one of his visits to his in-laws in [[Buckland]],<ref group=note>According to [[Hamfast Gamgee]], this happened while he was staying \"with his father-in-law\", which however would be impossible as Gorbadoc had been dead by then ({{SR|1363}}) according to [[Appendix C]].</ref> he drowned in a boating accident with his wife Primula. Frodo was still very young and he was taken under the custody of his uncle, [[Rorimac Brandybuck]].<ref>{{FR|Party}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Drogo'' was meaningless in contemporary [[Hobbitish]] [[Westron]]. It represented an original name ''Droga''.<ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref>\n{{references|note}}\n[[Category:Hobbits]]\n[[Category:Baggins]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n\n[[de:Drogo Beutlin]]\n[[fi:Drogo Reppuli]]\n[[fr:encyclo:personnages:hobbits:bessac:drogo bessac]]"}}}
