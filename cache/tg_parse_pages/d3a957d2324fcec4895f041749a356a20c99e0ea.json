Tolkien]] and associated with his work \"[[Ambarkanta|''Ambarkanta'': The Shape of the World]]\" (a text attributed to [[Rúmil (elf of Tirion)|Rúmil]]). The maps were reproduced in ''[[The Shaping of Middle-earth]]'' ([[1986]]).\n\n===Diagram I===\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Ambarkanta Map I.jpg|thumb|Diagram I]]\nDiagram I of the ''Ambarkanta'' maps details the shape of Arda before the [[Changing of the World]], from West to East and from zenith to nadir. The great mass of land making up much of [[Arda]] is named here as '''[[Ambar]]''', the earth. The farthest reaches of Ambar are designated ''[[Númen]]'' and ''[[Rómen]]'', West and East. The central landmass of Ambar is here named '''[[Middle-earth|Pelmar]]''' as well as ''Ambarendya''. The midmost point is named ''[[Endor]]''. To the [[Belegaer|west]] and [[East Sea|east]] of the central landmass is written '''Ear''', the seas. Spanning from the west shore of the west sea to the east shore of the east sea is '''[[Vista]]''', the lower airs. In these airs is written ''Aiwenore'', \"Bird-land\", and above it is ''Fanyamar'', \"Cloud-home\". Above Vista and all around Ambar is '''[[Ilmen]]''', the upper airs. These can be seen to cover the lands of [[Aman]] and the [[Uttermost East]], spanning also beneath '''[[Martalmar]]''', the roots of the Earth. Written in the span of Ilmen are its other names, ''Tinwë-mallë'' and ''Elenarda'', meaning \"Star-street\" and \"Stellar Kingdom\" respectively. Surrounding all of Ambar is '''[[Vaiya]]''', the [[Ekkaia|Encircling Seas]]. Beyond Vaiya there is only '''Kúma''' and '''Ava-Kúma''', the near and outer [[Void]]. Separating Vaiya from Kúma are the '''[[Ilurambar]]''', the Walls of the World pierced at Ando Lómen, the '''[[Door of Night]]''' in the West. At the very bottom of the diagram is written '''Ilu''', an early name for the world of Arda.<ref name=Ambar>{{SM|Ambar}}</ref>{{rp|242–243}}\n\nVaiya, that flows completely around the world, forms a sea below it. [[Ulmo]] the Lord of Waters dwells in Vaiya, below the Martalmar.<ref>{{SM|5b}}</ref> Much later, some pencilled changes and additions give ''Earambar'' for '''[[Ilurambar]]''',  ''[[Hidden Half]]'' right under '''[[Martalmar]]''' and Arda for '''Ilu''' in the title. Pencilled notes at the right-hand bottom corner is too faint to make out after the words \"Alter story of Sun\" ; that on the left reads : \"Make world always a globe but larger than now. Mountains of East and West prevent anyone from going to Hidden Half\".<ref name=Ambar>{{SM|Ambar}}</ref>{{rp|242–243}}\n\n===Diagram II===\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Ambarkanta Diagram II.jpg|thumb|Diagram II]]\nDiagram II of the ''Ambarkanta'' maps details the shape of Arda before the Changing of the World, from North to South. Once again, '''Ambar''' is shown to consist of '''Endor''' at its upper regions and '''Martalmar''' in its lowermost depths. '''Vista''' covers Endor from the north to south, with '''Ilmen''' surrounding all of Ambar, though much less so in the north and south than in the west and east as shown before. '''Vaiya''' encircles all the world of '''Ilu''', separated from '''Kúma''' by the '''Earambar'''. To the farthest reaches of either end of the world there is written ''[[Formen]]'' and '''[[Hyarmen|Harmen]]''', North and South.<ref name=Ambar/>{{rp|244–245}}\n{{clear}}\n===Diagram III===\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Ambarkanta Diagram III.jpg|thumb|Diagram III]]\nDiagram III of the ''Ambarkanta'' maps details the shape of Arda after the Changing of the World. Here the entirety of '''Ambar''' is made round: the '''Old Lands''' of the flat Arda now make up one half of Arda made round, and the '''New Lands''' are made to form Arda's other half. '''Vista''' becomes the lower atmospheres, while '''Ilmen''' becomes the upper atmospheres and the regions of outer space. '''Valinor''' and '''Eressëa''' are shown here to dwell within Ilmen. Beyond Ilmen there is still '''Vaiya''', and the voids beyond it. Passing away from the curvature of the earth and into Valinor within Ilmen is the '''[[Straight Road|Straight Path]]'''.<ref name=Ambar/>{{rp|246–247}}\n{{clear}}\n===Map IV===\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Ambarkanta Map IV.jpg|thumb|Map IV]]\nMap IV of the ''Ambarkanta'' maps details the lands of Arda after the fall of the [[Two Lamps]] and before the [[Battle of the Powers|War of the Gods]]. The waters and airs of '''Vaiya''' and '''Ilmen''' can be seen encircling the lands, with the '''[[Chasm of Ilmen]]''' separating the earth from Vaiya. In the region designated ''\"West - Númen\"'' lies '''Valinor''', and the city of '''[[Valmar]]'''. The far northeast and southeast regions of Valinor are named here as '''[[Araman|Eruman]]''' and '''[[Avathar|Arvalin]]'''. Along the coasts is written ''Westland or Westerness''. In the middle of Valinor on the east coast is the city of '''[[Tirion|Tún]]''', near to the mountain of '''[[Taniquetil|Taniqetil]]'''. Running to the north and south of Taniquentil are the '''[[Pelóri|Mountains of Valinor]]''', and on the coast of the '''Bay of Elfland''' is ''Eldaros (Elvenhome)''. A string of islands called '''[[Enchanted Isles|The Enchanted Magic Isles]]''' and the '''Shadowy Isles''' lie to the east of Valinor within the '''Belegaer or Great West Sea'''.\n\nValinor is separated from '''Pelmar''' or '''Middle-earth''' in the east by the '''Straits of Ice''' in the south and the '''[[Helcaraxë|Helkarakse]]''' in the north. In the very northernmost regions of Middle-earth near to the Helkarakse is '''[[Falas]]se''', the western coast of '''[[Beleriand]]'''. Running along the northern regions of Middle-earth are the '''[[Iron Mountains]]''', barring '''[[Utumno|Utumna]]''' from the rest of the world. On Beleriand's eastern borders run the '''[[Blue Mountains]]''', mirrored on Middle-earth's eastern side across the ''Northlands'' by the '''[[Orocarni|Red Mountains]]'''. In the south of the Northlands between the Blue and Red Mountains lies the '''[[Sea of Helcar|Sea of Helkar]]''', and on its eastern end there is '''[[Cuiviénen|Kuivienen]]'''. In the very center of Ambar near the west of the ''Mid-land'' there is written ''Earth-middle'' and ''Endor''. East of the Mid-land are the '''[[Mountains of the Wind]]''', the western border of '''[[Hildórien]]'''. In the ''Southland'' of Middle-earth is the '''[[Sea of Ringil]]''', between the '''[[Grey Mountains (ancient)|Grey Mountains]]''' in the west and the '''[[Yellow Mountains]]''' in the east. The southernmost point of Middle-earth is marked ''South'' and ''Harmen''.\n\nTo the east of Middle-earth are the '''[[Uttermost East|Lands of the Sun]]''', called also the ''Eastlands or Easterness''. Separating the two continents is the '''East Sea''', two more Straits of Ice lying at the northernmost and southernmost ends. In these lands lie the '''[[Walls of the Sun|Mountains or Walls of the Sun]]'''. The farthest east point of Ambar is designated ''\"East - Rómen\"''.<ref name=Ambar/>{{rp|248–249}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Map V===\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Ambarkanta Map V.png|thumb|Map V]]\nMap V of the ''Ambarkanta'' maps details the lands of Arda after the War of the Gods and before the Changing of the World. Surrounding the lands of Arda are the '''Outer Seas''' of ''Utgarsecg''', the Old English name of Vaiya. Here '''Aman''' and the '''Outer Lands (Valinor)''' are shown again in the west of the world, with the regions of '''Araman''' in the north and '''Arvalin''' in the south. A little south of Araman are the havens of '''[[Alqualondë|Alflon]]'''. In the center regions of Aman are the '''[[Two Trees]]''', '''Tún''', '''Valmar''', and '''Taniquetil'''. To the east of the shores of Valinor lies the '''Bay of Faery'''. At its northernmost point, the lands of Aman are still linked to the '''Hither Lands''' by the '''Helkaraksë''', leading across the northern regions of '''Belegar''' the ''Great Seas''. Given here also is the Great Sea's Old English name ''Ingarsecg''.\n\nIn this map, details of the lands of '''Beleriand''' can now be seen. The lands of '''[[Hithlum]]''' and the fortress of '''[[Angband]]''' and '''[[Thangorodrim]]''' lie to the north near '''[[Dor Daedeloth|Daidelos]]''', the northern wastes. Dividing the northern and southern regions of Middle-earth is the '''[[Great Gulf]]''' (possibly named here also as ''Beleglorn''), with the '''[[Straits of the World]]''' linking the Gulf to the '''Inland Sea'''. \n\nTo the southwest of the world lie the '''[[Dark Land|Dark Land (South Land)]]''', separated from Middle-earth by the expanded '''East Sea'''. In the far east of the world lie the '''Burnt Lands of the Sun''', along with the '''Walls of the Sun''' near to the western shores.<ref name=Ambar/>{{rp|250–251}}\n\n==Later Details==\nIn ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]'' ([[1987]]), [[Christopher Tolkien]] provided additional, redrawn versions of the regions of the furthest North in Map V, in order to \"enlarge and clarify..., adding letters to make references to it plainer.\" Here can be seen the closeness of '''Hithlum''' and the '''Helkaraksë''' to the '''[[Chasm of Ilmen]]''' at the edge of the world. Also shown is the river '''[[Sirion]]''' and the firth of '''[[Drengist]]''' cutting into the mountains of Hithlum. Not far to the northeast of Hithlum lies '''Angband''' and '''Thangorodrim''', and to Hithlum's southeast lies the realm of '''[[Dorthonion]]''' and the hidden city of '''[[Gondolin]]'''.<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, pp. 270 - 271</ref> \n<gallery>\nFile:Christopher Tolkien - Northern Beleriand 1.jpg|Christopher Tolkien's First Map\nFile:Christopher Tolkien - Northern Beleriand 2.jpg|Christopher Tolkien's Second Map\n</gallery>\n\n{{references}}\n{{maps}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Ambarkanta'' maps}}\n[[Category:Maps of Arda]]\n[[fi:The Ambarkanta:Diagram I]]\n[[fi:The Ambarkanta:Diagram II]]\n[[fi:The Ambarkanta:Diagram III]]\n[[fi:The Ambarkanta: Map IV]]\n[[fi:The Ambarkanta: Map V]]"}}}
