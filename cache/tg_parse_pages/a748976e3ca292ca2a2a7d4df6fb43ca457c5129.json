It was [[Ulmo]] who did not forsake the Outer Lands and kept the earth alive. Yavanna also came healing the hurts of Melkor, and [[Orome]] hunted monsters, and kept the shadows at bay while blowing the [[Valaróma]], albeit temporarily.<ref name=s1/>\n\nIt was during the Sleep of Yavanna when [[Aulë]] in his impatience created the [[Fathers of the Dwarves|Seven Fathers]] of the [[Dwarves]] under the mountains of [[Middle-earth]]. As Middle-earth was dark and dangerous, Aulë made his children robust and sturdy.<ref>{{S|2}}</ref>\n\n[[Varda]] created new [[stars]] and the [[Elves]] awoke. Only Dwarves and Elves roamed Middle-earth which was lit only by the stars, and most creatures were sleeping.<ref name=c3/> Most life could be found in [[Doriath]] under the guidance of [[Melian]] and in the North where [[Orcs]] and other creatures of the [[Morgoth|Enemy]] multiplied.<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry \"Sleep of Yavanna\".</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Long Night]], it was the rising of the [[Sun]] that finally returned light to Middle-earth and a [[Second Spring of Arda]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Years of the Trees]]\n\n{{references}}\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq\n| prev=[[Spring of Arda]]\n| list=Major events of [[Middle-earth]]\n| dates={{VY|3450}} - {{FA|1}}\n| next=[[Second Spring of Arda]]\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n[[Category:Periods]]\n[[fi:Yavannan uni]]"}}}
