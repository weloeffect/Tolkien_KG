After around the first hour of this meeting, [[Alwin Arundel Lowdham]] arrived at around 9:30 pm, singing:<ref name=\"poem\"/>\n\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\n:I've got a very Briny Notion\n::To drink myself to sleep.<ref name=\"poem\"/></poem>\n\nAfterwards, Lowdham was quite restless, refusing to sit down. During the next thirty minutes or so, Lowdham would occasionally burst into attempts at continuing his song, seldom getting further than the aforementioned first two lines:<ref name=\"poem\"/>\n\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\n:Bring me my bowl, my magic potion!\n::Tonight I’m diving deep.\n:::down! down! down!\n::Down where the dream-[[fish]] go.<ref name=\"poem\"/></poem>\n\nThe other members, notably [[Michael George Ramer]], did not take it well. As a result, Lowdham's singing intervals became less frequent. At around 10:00 pm, the conversation, led by Frankley and Lowdham, turned to neologisms.<ref name=\"poem\"/>\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Poems in The History of The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:The Notion Club Papers]]"}}}
