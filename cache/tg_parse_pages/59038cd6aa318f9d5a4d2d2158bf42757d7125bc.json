The trees of the [[Forest Gate]] were “hung with lichen”<ref>{{Cite DTP|H 08.001}}</ref>, and so were many trees in [[Fangorn Forest]].<ref>{{Cite DTP|LR 3.03.143}}</ref><ref>{{Cite DTP|LR 3.04.006}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''1984-1997: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]''''' \n:Many different types of lichen are distinguished in the game:\n\n:'''''Carpet Moss''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''Fangluin'', [[Quenya|Q.]] ''Laicafanga''), despite its name, was a pale green-grey lichen that grew in mats on smooth, damp, calcium-rich rock underground. The patches, often the size of a child or hobbit, released a fine powder when disturbed. When applied as poultices, the moss hastened bone-setting and doubled the rate of healing, retaining its powers for up to a year after harvest.<ref name=\"p94\">{{ICE|2026}}, p. 94</ref>\n\n:'''''Chékyûv''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''Ongluin'', [[Quenya|Q.]] ''Luinondo''), also called ''Blue Rub'', was a dark-blue lichen found on the interior of Easterling wells. Scraped and applied directly to a cut, it served as a sedative that also sped up the healing of the wound.<ref name=\"p94\"/>\n\n:'''''Gefnul''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''Gonhel'', [[Quenya|Q.]] ''Ondohellë''), also known as ''Earth Ash'', was a white lichen found near volcanoes. It could be consumed to restore health.<ref>{{ICE|2026}}, p. 106</ref>\n\n:'''''Gonhithui''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] “Misty Stone,” [[Quenya|Q.]] ''Hísimondo'') was a small blue lichen that grew on damp rocks along Mordor's watercourses. Ground and taken as a powder mixed with water it causes severe dehydration over the next day and may be fatal, with no known antidote. The only treatment is constant drinking.<ref name=\"p107\">{{ICE|2026}}, p. 107</ref>\n\n:'''''Kingslock''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''Cammaidh'', [[Quenya|Q.]] ''Malyama''), also known as ''Kly-bane'', was a grey-white lichen found on exposed mountain outcrops. It could be ground and consumed to quickly treat organ damage. It also served as an antidote to kly-based poisons.<ref name=\"p114\">{{ICE|2026}}, p. 114</ref>\n\n:'''''Lawrim'''''  ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''Barmallen'', [[Quenya|Q.]] ''Culuinassë''), also known as ''Law’r'', was a dull-orange lichen of the Ettenmoors. Contact caused painful rashes, while boiled extract produced a poison that induced shock and paralysis. The Hillmen used this extract as a dishonourable poison of last resort.<ref name=\"tenthpage\">{{ICE|2010}}, p. 178</ref><ref>{{ICE|2026}}, pp. 107-108</ref><ref>{{ICE|2026}}, p. 116</ref><ref>{{ICE|2026}}, p. 117</ref>\n\n:'''''Lichen Gloriosa''''', also known as ''Loth-nu-Fuin'' ([[Sindarin|S.]] Flowers-under-the-Night) was a glowing lichen of Mirkwood. It illuminated dark places and, freshly gathered, could help sharpen blades magically.<ref name=\"tenthpage\"/>\n\n:'''''Nelluin''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] “Blue Tooth,” [[Quenya|Q.]] ''Luinelet''), also known as ''Maynact'', was a dark-blue lichen that grew on spruce trees. Boiled and strained into a tea, it healed nerve damage as the cost of permanently staining one's teeth light-blue.<ref name=\"p125\">{{ICE|2026}}, p. 125</ref>\n\n:'''''Worlclivur''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''Falastir'', [[Quenya|Q.]] ''Falastir'') was a rare reddish-brown flowering lichen found along Eriador's coastlines. Its processed paste inflicted a range of ocular maladies.<ref name=\"p146\">{{ICE|2026}}, pp. 146</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Plants]]"}}}
