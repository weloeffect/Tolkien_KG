Tolkien]]'s [[legendarium]].\n\nIn everyday life she works as an accountant and financial worker, but she devotes her free time to J.R.R. Tolkien and art. She is a self-taught artist but as she says, she has been drawing Tolkien-inspired art since she first read ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' in 1995. Her preferred medium is watercolour.<ref>[https://www.patreon.com/rittare_art Rittare Art (Marya Filatova) on Patreon]</ref>\n\nShe specializes in portraits of characters from the [[First Age]], predominantly the [[Elves]] from ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', making many paintings and drawings of characters who are not often chosen by artists. But she also paints landscapes, many of which are based on her own photos and on places from the Caucasus Mountains.\n\n==See also==\n* [[:Category: Images by Marya Filatova|Images by Marya Filatova]]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.etsy.com/shop/RittareArt Marya Filatova on Etsy]\n* [http://filat.deviantart.com/gallery/ Marya Filatova on DeviantART]\n* [https://www.patreon.com/rittare_art Rittare Art (Marya Filatova) on Patreon]\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Artists|Filatova, Marya]]\n[[Category:Russian people|Filatova, Marya]]\n[[Category:People by name|Filatova, Marya]]"}}}
