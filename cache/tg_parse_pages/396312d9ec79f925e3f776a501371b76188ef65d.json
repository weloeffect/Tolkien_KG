This scene was extended in the latter edition.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe party begins. The hobbits are shown having fun with the elaborate festivities that Bilbo has arranged. The most elaborate is a grand display of a firework shaped like a dragon by [[Gandalf]] which is accidentally triggered by [[Merry]] and [[Pippin]]. Eventually, Bilbo gathers the attendees together, wishing to make an announcement. He tells the hobbits that 111 years is far too short a time to be among them, but that it is time for him to leave. He then disappears suddenly to the crowd's astonishment. \n\nIn the extended edition, a conversation between Bilbo and [[Frodo]] is added which shows the last time they see each other before Bilbo vanishes. [[Samwise Gamgee]] also appears. Frodo encourages him to ask [[Rosie Cotton]] for a dance.\n\n==Differences==\nThis is largely the first scene which parallels events from the books, as the previous scenes were largely meant to serve as an introduction to the world and characters. The scene is a largely accurate abridgement of the first few pages of \"[[A Long-expected Party]]\". The main difference is the introduction of Merry and Pippin, who are introduced after the party in the book.\n{{title}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring scenes|05]]"}}}
