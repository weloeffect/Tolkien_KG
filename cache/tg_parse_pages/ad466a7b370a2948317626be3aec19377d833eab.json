But none greatly recognised Gwindor, so much had his torment changed him, for he was bent with age and maimed. When Túrin was asked his name, ''[[Agarwaen]]'', son of ''[[Úmarth]]'' (that is \"Blood-stained\", son of \"Ill-fate\") he called himself, for he wished to leave his darkness behind.\n[[File:Alan Lee - The Reforging of Anglachel.jpg|left|thumb|''The reforging of Anglachel'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]\nThe sword [[Anglachel]] was forged anew so that its black edges burned with pale fire; and Túrin's prowess with the blade gained him the respect of the [[Elves]], and after a time he became a counsel of Orodreth; and his advice was to fight Morgoth openly. This Gwindor ever gainsaid, marking that he knew the array of [[Morgoth]] - for he had seen that the power of [[Angband]] was greater than all the gatherings of Elves and [[Men]]. Secrecy and stealth should be their manner.\n\nBut Túrin advanced in influence and was soon chief counsellor to the King; and Orodreth then took Túrin's guidance and the Elves no longer took secret ways in their skirmishes, but marched openly from Nargothrond; and a bridge was built at the [[Doors of Felagund]] so that they might make swift passage over [[Narog]] and hasten to war. For his valour, the elves girt Túrin in [[dwarf-mail]] and [[Dwarf-masks|dwarf-mask]] so that his enemies flew from him – and they called him ''[[Mormegil]]'', the \"Black Sword\".\n\nAll the while, Gwindor's honour fell, for he was weakened from Angband; and Finduilas looked now upon Túrin with admiration, and she found her heart moved when he was near.  Seeing this, Gwindor's friendship with Túrin was cooled and the elf cursed Morgoth, for the [[Great Enemy]] it seemed would follow his foes until the very bitter end; and he saw the ruin that came in Túrin's train. And Gwindor went to Finduilas and said she must beware, for Agarwaen was in truth Túrin; truly was he the son of [[Húrin]], whose kin Morgoth cursed even now.\n\nFinduilas came straight away to Túrin and asked him why he would hide his real name. In this, Túrin was angered, for he felt his fate was now betrayed; but Gwindor said, ''\"The doom lies in yourself, not your name.\"''\n\nYet in this time when the Black Sword held peace west of [[Sirion]], [[Morwen]] and [[Nienor|Niënor]] fled the tyranny of [[Dor-Lómin]] to come to [[Doriath]] in [[Melian]]'s ward. But there they found Túrin long gone.\n[[fi:Túrin Nargothrondissa (HLT)]]"}}}
