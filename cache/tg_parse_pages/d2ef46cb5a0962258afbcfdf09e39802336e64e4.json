So the first known historical fact is that they were alerted by the rise of [[Dol Guldur]], so they drifted westward. Around {{TA|1050}} many [[Harfoots]] settled in [[Eriador]] and about {{TA|1150|n}} the [[Fallohides]] followed, while many [[Stoors]] who emerged from the [[Redhorn Pass]] settled near [[Tharbad]] in [[Dunland]], specifically [[Angle|the Angle]]. In {{TA|1300|n}} the Kingdom of [[Angmar]] was founded, so the northern Hobbits had to flee from further westwards, reaching [[Bree]]. Some Stoors (in {{TA|1356|n}}) returned to the [[Gladden Fields|Gladden]]. The others continued westward and their first settlements were in Bree and [[Staddle]].<ref name=\"TA\">{{App|TA}}</ref>\n\nEventually, in the year {{TA|1601}} a large population of [[Bree-hobbits]] was granted permission by King [[Argeleb II]],<ref name=\"TA\"/> one of the last few Kings of [[Arthedain]], to colonize the region beyond the [[Brandywine]], and were later joined by the Stoors of Dunland. This would become [[The Shire]], the main homeland of most of Hobbit-kind.<ref name=\"Hobbits\"/>\n{{references}}\n[[Category:History of the Shire]]\n[[Category:Periods]]"}}}
