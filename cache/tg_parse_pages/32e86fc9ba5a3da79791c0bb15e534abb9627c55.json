They were born during perilous years for Gondor. King Ondoher had been warned by [[Forthwini]] of [[Éothéod]] that the [[Wainriders]] were on the move. Indeed the realm was assaulted simultaneously from the East and the South.\n\nIn {{TA|1944}} Artamir and his father Ondoher were the two top leaders of the northern army of [[Gondor]] and led their forces into [[Ithilien]] in order to deploy upon the [[Dagorlad]], expecting the enemy from the north or north-east. Unfortunately the enemy not only came quicker than expected, but also directly from the east along the outskirts of the [[Ered Lithui]]. The army of Gondor was strung out when the vanguard was struck by a powerful force of mixed cavalry and chariot-borne warriors. The King, Artamir, and most of the King's Guard were annihilated in the attack.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\nArtamir was the eldest son and heir of Ondoher, and with his death, the line of succession should move to close male relatives of the [[House of Anárion]]. However his younger brother Faramir was also slain (he secretly disguised himself to participate in the battle) as well as the King's sister-son, [[Minohtar]] and the throne of Gondor remained vacant.\n\nHis sister Fíriel was married to [[Arvedui]], son and heir of the northern King of [[Arthedain]], and partly based on his marriage, he asked to be granted the throne.  However, the  Steward [[Pelendur]] and the [[Council of Gondor]] selected general [[Eärnil II|Eärnil]], who had crushed the enemies in the [[Battle of the Camp]] and saved the realm, to be the next king.<ref name=\"Gondor\" />\n\n==Etymology==\n''Artamir'' is [[Quenya]]. Its meaning is not glossed, but as Paul Strack explains, it means \"Noble Jewel\" and is a compound of the prefixal form [[arta]] of ''arata'' (\"noble\") and [[mir|mírë]] (\"jewel\").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-856718477.html|articlename=Q.
