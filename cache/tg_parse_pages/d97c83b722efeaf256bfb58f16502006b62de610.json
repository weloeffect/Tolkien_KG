The Free People who still inhabit these lands are scattered, simple, and few. Beyond their poorly patrolled borders, an unknown darkness gathers, and only a small band of ostracized [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]] has taken notice of the threat.\n\n[[Halbarad]], captain of the northern watch, requests your aid. A shadow is within the borders, forces gather outside the Rangers' reach, and tales of unquieted dead begin to circulate anew.\n\n*''The Hunt for the Ember Crown''\nThe roads of [[Bree-land]] are beset by marauding [[Wargs]], bolder and cleverer than the land has known for many years. The [[Thain]] of the [[Shire]] has been slow to react, for (say the rumours) something else darkens his thoughts. Th Thain has welcomed odd visitors into his home, and he has kept everyone tight-lipped about what troubles him so. With the Thain so distracted, the task falls to you to secure the Shire, as only bold heroes dare travel the wilderness in these troubled times...\n\n*''Shadowed Paths''\nDarkness is growing in the heart of [[Mirkwood|Mirkwood Forest]] and deep in the abandoned mines of [[Moria]]. Giant spiders and chilling shades terrorize those who stray from the path, and the [[Wood-elves]] are arming for war. Will your band of heroes brave the darkness to discover what new power lurks in the far corners of the land?\n\n*''Haunting of Dale''\nFear grips the city of ''Dale'' as a mysterious shadow stalks through its recobbled streets and across its sleepy farmland. Dark rumours are traded over candlelight: the apparition appears in several places at once, it moves through stone and wood as if it were never there, and its appearance always foretells danger and death. As hysteria climbs, [[Bain|King Bain]], son of [[Bard]], seeks any brave enough to root out the truth and put the city's troubles to rest.\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lord of the Rings: Journeys in Middle-earth, The}}\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Board games]]\n[[Category:Microsoft Windows games]]\n[[Category:Smartphone apps]]"}}}
