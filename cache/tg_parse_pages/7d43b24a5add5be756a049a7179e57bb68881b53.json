It is where the [[Gladden River]] meets the Anduin and forms the [[Gladden Fields]]. Throughout history, it had been occupied by [[Elves]], [[Men]] and [[Hobbits]].\n\n==History==\nIn the [[First Age]], the [[Eldar]] settled east of the river Anduin during the [[Great Journey]], and founded the land of [[Atyamar]], which however was sometime later was afflicted by evil weather and destroyed their homes.<ref name=Aty>{{NM|P1vii}}, pp. 50-51</ref> The [[Teleri]] who were too afraid to cross the [[Misty Mountains]] stopped there. They became the [[Nandor]].<ref>{{S|Captivity}}</ref> Later they were joined by the [[Avari]], specifically the [[Penni]], who came west. But eventually some of them left the Vales for the west. \n\nThe [[Silvan Elves]] established realms on both sides of the Vales, and their remnants were the [[Elves of Mirkwood]] or the [[Galadhrim]].<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #67</ref>\n\nNear the end of the First Age, the Vales were occupied by [[Edain]], the ancestors of the [[Northmen]]. Those were in confederation with the [[Dwarves of Khazad-dûm]] and the [[Longbeards]] and provided food in return for Dwarven weapons and precious items. This cooperation continued until the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]], when the Dwarves closed themselves in their mountains and the Men were scattered.<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref><ref>{{PM|Relationns}}</ref>\n\nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of the Plains]], some [[Northmen]] were gathered under the leadership of [[Marhwini]] son of [[Marhari]], who led them north between Anduin and Mirkwood, eventually settling in the Vales of Anduin between the [[Carrock]] and the [[Gladden Fields]].<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, (i) ''The Northmen and the Wainriders'', note 8</ref>  They were joined by many fugitives who came through [[Mirkwood]].  This was the birth of the [[Éothéod]].\n\nAt the end of the second age [[Woodmen]] also came forth to destroy the Orcs who had ambushed Isildur on his return from Gondor. At the end of the third age the middle of Greenwood the Great was granted to the same Woodmen. Just before the War of the Ring the Woodmen also aided the elves in the hunt for Gollum.\n\nSometime during the [[Third Age]] the [[Hobbits]] migrated to the Vales of Anduin from an unknown earlier location; the Vales are their first known location before eventually the [[Shadow]] of [[Dol Guldur]] fell on [[Mirkwood|Greenwood]]. The [[Harfoots]] left for the west in {{TA|1050}} and began their [[Wandering Days]]. When [[Angmar]] threatened [[Eriador]], some of the [[Stoors]] would return to the east and around {{TA|1356}} settled in the Gladden Fields.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>\n\nOnce a fair and fertile land, it became a dangerous area, beleaguered by the creatures of the [[Necromancer]] at [[Dol Guldur]]. However, when the evil [[Angmar|Kingdom of Angmar]] was destroyed in {{TA|1975}}, freeing up land to the north, [[Frumgar]] led the Éothéod to the vale between the rivers [[Greylin]] and [[Langwell]],<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref> where they built [[Framsburg|a city]].\n\nAround the time of [[Cirion]] (c. T.A. 2500) the [[Balchoth]], a tribe of [[Easterlings]] east of Mirkwood, often made raids through the forest and attacked the Vales until the southern vale was largely deserted. By {{TA|2510}} the Balchoth were continuously reinforced from the east, building great boats and rafts on the east shores of Anduin. They swarmed over the River and swept away the defenders but were [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant|defeated]] by the Gondorians and the Éothéod.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref>\n\nIn the later years before the [[War of the Ring]], few Northmen dwelt on the shores between the Gladden and [[Rauros]],<ref>{{App|F1}}</ref> such as the [[Beornings]].<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}</ref> During [[Grimbeorn]]'s time, the [[High Pass]] and the [[Ford of Carrock]] were kept open and no [[Orcs|Orc]] or [[Wargs|Wolf]] dared to enter his land.<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\n[[Firs]], [[strawberries]] and [[wild berries]]<ref>{{H|Pan}}</ref> (cf.) grew in the Vales.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Vales of Anduin map.jpg|thumb|right|Map of the Vales of Anduin in''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'' ]]\n'''2019: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Vales of Anduin is a region notable for connecting together the in-game regions of [[Misty Mountains]], [[Lothlórien]] and Northern [[Mirkwood]] which were previously separate and isolated on the game landmass. The Northern Vales are inhabited by [[Beornings]], centered around [[Beorn's Hall|Grimbeorn's Lodge]] east of the Great River and ''Vegbár'', a toll-collecting station to the west. The Middle Vales are home to the [[Woodmen]], living in the larger town of ''Hultvís'' or the smaller villages of ''Blómgard'' and ''Arhaim''. The Southern Vales are patrolled by [[Galadhrim]] sentinels who do not settle there. Near the [[Gladden Fields]] long-deserted remains of Hobbit [[smials]] can be found, while higher up the Misty Mountains sits ''Kidzul-kâlah'', now-abandoned outpost of the once-proud [[Khazad-Dûm]].\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Valleys]]\n[[Category:Rhovanion]]\n\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/regions/val d anduin]]\n[[fi:Anduinin Laaksot]]"}}}
