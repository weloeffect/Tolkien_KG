It consisted in an underground complex inside the hill of [[Amon Rûdh]].\n\n==Description==\nThe entrance of Bar-en-Danwedh was hidden, to find it you have to approach Amon Rûdh from the north and follow a secret path on the slopes of the hill. The path wound to and fro, and without a guide it may take days to find the right way.<ref>{{CH|7}}, pp. 128-30</ref>\n\nThe house of Mîm was vast and could have housed hundreds or more. There were many chambers within the halls for storage, working and dwelling but they were mostly empty. There was a small room that Mîm used for work that had a hearth and it shared a smoke-vent with another small hall. There was a hidden stair that led to the summit of Amon Rûdh that Mîm kept secret.<ref>{{CH|7}}, pp. 136-7</ref>\n\n==History==\nBefore the arrival of [[Túrin]] and his [[Gaurwaith|outlaws]], the place was a settlement of the [[Petty-dwarves]] and it was known as Bar-en-Nibin-noeg, \"House of the Petty-dwarves\". As the [[First Age]] wore on, these people dwindled, until at last only three remained; [[Mîm]] and his two sons [[Khîm]] and [[Ibun]]. To their misfortune, the Petty-dwarves encountered [[Túrin]] at the time he led a desperate band of outlaws. Mîm's sons fled, but Mîm himself was caught, and agreed to house the outlaws in exchange for his own life. So the Dwarf-delvings of Amon Rûdh became known as Bar-en-Danwedh, meaning \"House of Ransom\". The ransom, in fact, was a double one: when they returned to Amon Rûdh, they discovered that Khîm had been shot by an arrow (fired from the bow of [[Andróg]]) as he fled in their early encounter, and later died. In recompense, Túrin promised to pay Mîm a ransom of his own, if ever he was able.<ref name=\"TSTT\">{{S|Turin}}</ref>\n\nTúrin and the outlaws stayed for more than a year in Bar-en-Danwedh, where they were joined by [[Beleg|Beleg Strongbow]] out of [[Doriath]]. They defended the lands around the hill against [[Morgoth]]'s forces, and became so famous in that region that they gained a following, with Túrin and Beleg coming to be known as the [[Two Captains]] of [[Dor-Cúarthol]]. Their refuge was given the name Echad i Sedryn, \"Camp of the Faithful\", the \"faithful\" referred to the Old Company, since only they knew the way into it and no one else was admitted.<ref>{{CH|8}}, p. 144</ref> In the end, though, disaster struck: Mîm betrayed them to the [[Orcs]], who slew the outlaws, [[Sack of Bar-en-Danwedh|sacked]] their halls and captured Túrin. Beleg survived, and Mîm fled from him, never to return to his home on Amon Rûdh.<ref name=\"TSTT\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Bar-en-Danwedh'' is [[Sindarin]] for \"House of Ransom\",<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> consisting of ''[[bar]]'' (\"house\" or \"dwelling\")<ref>{{S|Appendix}}</ref> + ''[[en]]'' (\"of\") + ''[[danwedh]]'' (\"ransom\").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-4281135043.html|articlename=S.
