Remember the Fen of Serech!|[[Húrin]], in ''[[The Wanderings of Húrin]]''}}\n\nThe '''Fen of Serech''' was a marshland between [[Dorthonion]] and the [[Ered Wethrin]], at the confluence of the [[Sirion]] and its tributary, the [[Rivil]]. It lay at the north-east end of the [[Pass of Sirion]] which connected [[Anfauglith]] and ([[West Beleriand|West]]) [[Beleriand]]<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref> and thus was the site of many battles.\n\n==History==\nDuring the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]], the returning [[Noldor]] swiftly overcame the [[Orcs]] that had been sent against them and hunted them over the mountains. In the meantime another Orc army that had beleaguered [[Círdan]] rushed up the [[Vales of Sirion]] to their aid, but they were attacked by [[Celegorm]] as he led part of the Elven-host down from the hills around [[Eithel Sirion]]. Celegorm drove the Orcs into the Fen of Serech where most of them perished.<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref>\n[[File:Henning Janssen - Aid on the Fens.jpg|thumb|left|''Aid on the Fens'' by [[Henning Janssen]]]]\nIn {{FA|455}} the [[Dagor Bragollach]] began<ref>{{GA|145}}</ref> with rivers of flame from [[Thangorodrim]]. In the onslaught, [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] was cut off from all of his forces except for a small company in the Fen. [[Barahir]] saved the king by rushing in and creating a wall of spears about him, which enabled Finrod to escape back to [[Nargothrond]]. Barahir's losses were heavy, but his deed forged a great friendship between Finrod and the kin of Barahir. Finrod gave Barahir his [[Ring of Barahir|ring]] in token of his vow of friendship.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>\n\nIn the fifth battle of Beleriand, the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] (fought in {{FA|472}}<ref>{{GA|217}}</ref>), King Fingon had hidden his forces in the eastern hills of the Ered Wethrin and the fortress of [[Barad Eithel]]. The [[Captain of Morgoth]] marched his battle-line forward until it was between the Fen and the fortress. Before the outworks of Barad Eithel the heralds of Morgoth placed [[Gelmir (son of Guilin)|Gelmir]] of Nargothrond and cut off his hands and feet and head. Gelmir's brother [[Gwindor]] pursued the heralds beyond the Fen of Serech and slew them, which caused the entire Elven host to charge in and slaughter Morgoth's western forces.\n\nHowever, this seeming victory led to disaster. Fingon's host reached the gates of Thangorodrim where Morgoth released his main host. Fingon retreated and was saved by Turgon and [[Húrin]] when surrounded, but their combined forces still had to withdraw when [[Glaurung]] appeared and fell upon [[Maedhros]]' eastern forces. Turgon and the host of [[Gondolin]] were forced back across the Fen by the coming of [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]], Lord of the [[Balrogs]]. Húrin and [[Huor]], with the remaining men of the [[House of Hador]], made a stand upon the banks of the Rivil, which allowed Turgon to escape to Gondolin. Huor and his men were slain one by one by the Orcs, but Húrin slayed seventy of the enemy before being captured.<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>\n\nIn {{FA|500}}, Morgoth released Húrin and set a watch upon him. After visiting [[Hithlum]] Húrin sought to enter the hidden city of [[Gondolin]]. When [[Thorondor]] the eagle reported Húrin's presence below the [[Echoriath]] Turgon suspected that Húrin had surrendered to Morgoth and refused to aid him. Despairing before the silent cliffs, Húrin shouted: \"''Turgon, Turgon, remember the Fen of Serech!''\"<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Serech'' is clearly a [[Sindarin]] word, but its meaning is unclear,<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1967418619.html|articlename=S.
