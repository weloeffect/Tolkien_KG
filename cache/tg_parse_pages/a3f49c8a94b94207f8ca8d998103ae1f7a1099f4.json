Gollum tells Sméagol he is a liar, a thief, and a murderer. Sméagol is anguished at this and tells Gollum to go away. Gollum scoffs, saying the two of them survived because of him. Sméagol whimpers ''\"I hate you,\"'' and tells Gollum that Frodo protects him now. ''\"We don't need you,\"'' Sméagol tells Gollum, who gets angrier and more vicious with each comment by Sméagol. After telling Gollum to ''\"Leave now and never come back\"'' multiple times, Sméagol finds that Gollum is gone. He jumps with glee, shouting ''\"Sméagol is free!\"''\n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers scenes|29]]"}}}
