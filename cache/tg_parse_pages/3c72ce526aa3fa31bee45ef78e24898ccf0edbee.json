The tree was originally named '''''Neldor''''', meaning \"Triple-tree\", because of its three massive trunks.\n\n==History==\nDuring the time of the [[Quest for the Silmaril]], Thingol feared his daughter [[Lúthien]] would risk her life to seek out her love [[Beren]] and help him in his quest. He had a house built among the branches of the great beech and imprisoned Lúthien there. Because of this the tree was then called '''Hírilorn''', meaning \"Tree of the Lady\"<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> in [[Sindarin]], though it did not hold Lúthien for long. Using her magical arts, she escaped from Hírilorn and set out to aid Beren, eventually helping him recover a [[Silmarils|Silmaril]] from [[Morgoth]]'s [[Iron Crown]]. \n\nJust as the Quest for the Silmaril began near Hírilorn the quest ended there as well. During the [[Hunting of the Wolf]], Beren received a mortal wound from [[Carcharoth]] and died in Lúthien's arms beneath the branches of the ''Tree of the Lady''.<ref>{{S|19}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Túrin]] was seventeen years old news from [[Dor-lómin]] ceased due to the vigilance of the servants of [[Morgoth]]. Túrin went looking for King [[Thingol]] to ask for mail, sword, and shield; he found the king with [[Melian]] sitting under Hírilorn. There they advised him and his wish for arms was granted.<ref>{{CH|5}}, pp. 82-85</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n[[Christopher Tolkien]] translated ''Hírilorn'' as \"Tree of the Lady\": ''[[hîr]]'' + ''[[-il]]'' (\"lady\") + ''[[orn]]'' (\"tree\").<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref>\n\nAn obsolete name of the tree, used in the early [[Gnomish]] stage of the language, was ''Golosbrindi'' (glossed as \"Queen of the Forest\"), replaced with ''Hirilorn'' (\"Queen of the Trees\".<ref>{{LT2|In}}, p. 51</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Doriath]]\n[[Category:Ilkorin locations]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[Category:Trees]]"}}}
