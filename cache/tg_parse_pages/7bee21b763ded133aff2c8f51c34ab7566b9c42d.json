Famed Balrogs include [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]], slain by [[Ecthelion]], and [[Durin's Bane]], slain by [[Gandalf]].\n\n==History==\nBalrogs, also called [[Valaraukar]], were originally [[Ainur]] created by [[Ilúvatar]], probably those who joined [[Melkor]] during his discordance in the [[Music of the Ainur]].

After Ungoliant threatened Morgoth, his cry was heard by them. Then the Balrogs issued from their hiding-place and traveled to [[Lammoth]] like a tempest of fire. With their whips they destroyed Ungoliant's webs and made her take flight.<ref name=\"Return\">{{S|9}}</ref>\n\nThe Balrogs were first encountered by the Elves during the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]] (\"Battle under the Stars\") when the [[Noldor]]in [[Exile of the Noldor|Exiles]] [[Return of the Noldor|returned]] to [[Middle-earth]] at the end of the [[First Age]].<ref>{{App|Elves}}, p. 1128</ref> After the victory of the Noldor over Morgoth's forces, the Elf Lord [[Fëanor]] pressed on towards [[Angband]], but the Balrogs came up against him. He was surrounded and fought long against them before being mortally wounded by [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]], Lord of the Balrogs. Though Fëanor's sons fought off the demons of fire, Fëanor died of his wounds soon after.<ref>{{S|13}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Wars of Beleriand]], Morgoth only came out of Angband on [[Fall of Fingolfin|one occasion]]. Instead, he sent the Balrogs to fight and lead in battle.

As noted by [[Christopher Tolkien]], the Old English word contains the elements ''bealu'' (\"evil\"; as in ''bale(ful)'') and ''wearg'' (\"wolf, outlaw\") or ''broga'' (\"terror\").<ref>{{SM|QA1}}, p. 209</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n===The Book of Lost Tales===\nIn the earliest version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', the Balrogs are mentioned in some of the tales, but they only play an important role in the first that was written, in \"[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]\".<ref>{{LT2|In}}, p. 67</ref> Here some of the details remained later versions, while others were omitted: \"Now these were demons with whips of flame and claws of steel by whom he tormented those of the [[Noldoli]] who durst withstand with him in anything – and the [[Eldar]] have called them Malkarauki.\"<ref name=\"Gondolin\">{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|169}} They were attired with iron armour and helm.<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|181, 194}}\n\n===Number===\nThe Balrogs were originally envisioned as being immense in number:\n{{blockquote|The early conception of Balrogs makes them less terrible, and certainly more destructible, than they afterwards became: they existed in 'hundreds' (p. 170), and were slain by [[Tuor]] and the [[Gondothlim]] in large numbers: \"thus five fell before Tuor's great axe [[Dramborleg]], three before [[Ecthelion]]'s sword, and two score were slain by the warriors of the king's house.|''[[The Book of Lost Tales: Part Two]]'', commentary by Christopher Tolkien on \"[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]\", pp. 212-3}}\n{{blockquote|There came wolves and serpents and there came Balrogs one thousand, and there came Glomund the Father of Dragons.|''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]'', ''Quenta Silmarillion'', Chapter 16, §15}}\n\nAs the [[legendarium]] became more formidable and internally consistent, and the Balrogs more terrible, this number was much reduced. In the end Tolkien stated that there were probably \"at most\" seven Balrogs:\n{{blockquote|In the margin my father wrote: 'There should not be supposed more than say 3 or at most 7 ever existed.'|''[[Morgoth's Ring]]'', Section 2 (AAm*): note 50}}\n\nIt should, however, be noted that these texts postdate the published ''The Lord of the Rings'', but predate the materials from which the published ''The Silmarillion'' was drawn. The exact number of Balrogs is therefore very uncertain, but Tolkien's note above seems to have been his final word.\n\n===The Lays of Beleriand===\nA Balrog named [[Lungorthin]] is mentioned only once in ''[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]''. After [[Húrin]] was captured by [[Morgoth]], Lungorthin smote him on the mouth. <ref>{{LB|1}}, pp. 98, 102-3</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Christopher Tolkien]], it is likely that Lungorthin is not another name for [[Gothmog]], as the name Gothmog was mentioned in the earliest Middle-earth writings, as well as the final version of Tolkien's mythology.\n\n{{Blockquote|The ''thane of Morgoth'' who smote him on the mouth (version I, 59) now becomes ''Lungorthin'', ''Lord of Balrogs'' (96)——which is probably to be interpreted as ‘a Balrog lord’, since Gothmog, reappears in the ‘Silmarillion’ tradition.|''[[The Lays of Beleriand]]'', ''[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]'', [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher Tolkien’s]] ''Commentary on Part I of the second version''}}\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Balrogs in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings (1978 film) - Balrog.jpg|Durin's Bane in [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy - Balrog.jpg|Durin's Bane in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]''\nFile:Thaurlach.jpg|The Balrog Thaurlach from ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\nFile:Shadow of War - Tar Goroth.jpg|The Balrog Tar Goroth from ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]]''\nFile:The Rings of Power (TV series) - Durin's Bane.png|Durin's Bane in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power|The Rings of Power]]'' series \n</gallery>\n'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''\n:The Balrog has wings and appears capable of limited flight.

He fled there are the breaking of [[Thangorodrim]], but was followed by an elf-maiden Glathlírel who was determined to end him. The Balrog eluded her for millennia, until she was able to face him in combat and defeat him. Rather than kill the Balrog, the two Blue Wizards decided to imprison him in the Rift, so that he could await his judgment at the end of days. However, by the end of the Third Age his chains were loosening and a band of players was sent to defeat the weakened Balrog - something, that as Gandalf remarked, should have been done ages ago.\n\n'''2009: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'':'''\n:The Balrog is one of the \"heroes\" available to Servants of Sauron during evil campaign.
