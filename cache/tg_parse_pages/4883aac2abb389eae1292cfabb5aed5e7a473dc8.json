It serves as a lament for [[Gandalf]]. \n\nThe music was written by [[Leonard Rosenman]], the lyrics were written by [[Mark Fleischer]]. A shorter version formed the background music for the twenty-first scene, \"[[Homage to Gandalf]]\".\n\n==Lyrics==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\"> \nLet the night never cease to call you\nLet the day nevermore be the same\nThough you've gone where we cannot find you\nIn each heart you have set your name\nMithrandir far you wander\nAnd long may your name be sung\nThrough kingdoms of starlight\nAnd realms of the sun\nMithrandir though you're hidden\nWe're still guided by your light\nYou're walking beside us\nA friend in the night\nWe were lost when the dark descended\nAnd the light gathered into a storm\nYou appeared like a sunlit morning\nAt the winds of a world at war\nMithrandir far you wander\nAnd long may your name be sung\nThrough kingdoms of starlight\nAnd realms of the sun\nMithrandir though you're hidden\nWe're still guided by your light\nYou're walking beside us\nA friend in the night\nMithrandir rising through the shadow\nLike a star shining deep in its home\nYou will dwell in our hearts forever\nNevermore will we stand alone\n</poem>\n{{title}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings (1978 film) soundtrack]]"}}}
