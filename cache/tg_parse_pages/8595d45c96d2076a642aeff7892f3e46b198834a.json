The first two novels might be caracterized as stories of fantasy reminiscent of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', where the heroes return home after a perilous adventure. And the latter, ''Ronia the Robber's Daughter'', has been described as a work reminding of the genre [[wikipedia:High fantasy|High fantasy]].<ref>Johan Sandberg, \"[http://tolkiensarda.se/new/nummer/magsidor/arttre9.htm Svensk fantasy svälter]\" (\"Swedish Fantasy is Starving\") in ''[[Tolkiens Arda]]'', issue 14, 2003.</ref>\n\nIn the late 1940s, when [[J.R.R.
