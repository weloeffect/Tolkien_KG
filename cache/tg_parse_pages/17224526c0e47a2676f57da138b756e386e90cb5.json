The term particularly applied to the [[Sindar]] but also encompassed the [[Laiquendi]] and, used broadly, all the [[Nandor]].<ref>{{S|Captivity}}</ref>\n\nThe Eldar of Aman described all Elves who did not complete the Great Journey as [[Moriquendi]], but the Exiles found that this term was offensive to the Sindar. To keep peace with their neighbours, the Exiles ceased to use the term [[Calaquendi]] (except in written lore) and altered their usage of Moriquendi to refer only to the Avari and other Elven peoples who \"had not long dwelt in Beleriand and were not subjects of [[Elwë]].\" In such circumstances as the \"old distinction\" had to be spoken of, the polite terms [[Amanyar]] and Úmanyar came to be preferred.<ref name=B/>\n\nOn one occasion, [[Caranthir]] of the Noldor openly referred to King [[Thingol]] of the Sindar as a \"Dark Elf\" ([[Quenya|Q.]] \"Moriquende\").<ref>{{S|13}}</ref> This was meant as an insult;<ref>{{S|Index}}, entry \"Dark Elves\"</ref> it was especially malicious considering that Thingol alone among the Úmanyar was reckoned as one of the Calaquendi, having been one of the original three Elven ambassadors to Valinor.<ref>{{S|4}}</ref>\n\nA historic name for the Úmanyar that eventually fell out of everyday use during the period of the [[Exile of the Noldor|Noldorin Exile]] was '''''Hekeldi''''' (sing.

Hence the names ''Hekelmar'' and ''Hekeldamar'', or ''Heculbar'' and ''Hecellubar'' in the Telerin, for [[Beleriand]].<ref name=B/>{{rp|365}}\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nAccording to the definition given in ''The Silmarillion'', the Úmanyar included all the Elves who started but did not complete the Great Journey:\n{{blockquote|But others of the Eldar there were who set out indeed upon the westward march, but became lost upon the long road, or turned aside, or lingered on the shores of Middle-earth [...] Those Elves the Calaquendi call the Úmanyar, since they came never to the land of Aman and the Blessed Realm|{{S|3}}}}\n\nHowever, the definition given in ''The History of Middle-earth'' includes only subjects of Thingol:\n{{blockquote|Moriquendi was now applied to all other Elves, except the Ñoldor and Sindar, that is to Avari or to any kind of Elves that at the time of the coming of the Ñoldor had not long dwelt in Beleriand and were not subjects of Elwë. [...] The old distinction, when made, was represented by the new terms Amanyar 'those of Aman', and Úamanyar or Úmanyar 'those not of Aman'|{{WJ|B}}}}\n\nIn the First Age, this was for the most part a distinction without a difference, as there was little contact between populations of Eldar dwelling on opposite sides of the [[Ered Luin]]. After the end of the First Age there was neither an Elwë to whom to be subjected nor a Beleriand in which to dwell, so the distinction becomes even less clear. The term may well have fallen out of use, as it is not attested in later Ages.\n\n{{references}}\n{{elves}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Umanyar}}\n[[Category:Elven peoples]]\n[[Category:Quenya demonyms]]\n[[de:Úmanyar]]\n[[fr:encyclo/peuples/elfes/umanyar]]\n[[fi:Úmanyar]]"}}}
