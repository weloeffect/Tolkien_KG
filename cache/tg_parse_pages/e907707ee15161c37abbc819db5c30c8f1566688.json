''Elanor'' was founded in [[1999]], at which point it was exclusive a [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]-only society, in order to bring a group of committed Tolkien-enthusiasts together over a range of activities.<ref name=\"AH\">Hedwig Valkiers, \"Around the World in 80(?) Societies: Elanor\" in [[Andrew Butler]] (ed.), ''[[Amon Hen (journal)|Amon Hen]]'', vol. [[Amon Hen 222|222]], [[March]] [[2010]], p.26</ref> Elanor was founded after Flemish Tolkien enthusiasts felt a Tolkien Society independent from [[Unquendor]] would suit them better. Although both Flanders and the Netherlands share the same language, there are considerable cultural differences separating these territories. In recent years Elanor and Unquendor have grown closer and are organizing joint events.<ref>http://elanor.deliverance.be/?tag=tolkien-verenigingen</ref>\n\n==About==\n{{quote|We have been able to bring together a tight group of people who have fantasy reading and Tolkien's work at heart. By providing a large variety of activites to everyone's taste, anyone can enthusiastically partake, tell stories, discuss and compare with stories by authors such as [[wikipedia:Robin Hobb|Robin Hobb]] and [[wikipedia:Terry Goodkind|Terry Goodkind]].<br/>Each activity has as its main purpose fun and talking free and easy about our common hobby and this principally at the [[Birthday Toast|Tolkien Birthday Toast]] on [[3 January|January 3]], the quiz at the end of [[February]], the [[Tolkien Reading Day]] in [[March]] and the games nights. The [[Inklings|Inkling]]-evenings on the other hand are meant to discuss Tolkien's literary works in earnest.
