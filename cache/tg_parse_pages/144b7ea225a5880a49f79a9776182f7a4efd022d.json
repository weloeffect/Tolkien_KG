Sharku was invented by [[Warner Bros.]] for [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]], where he was portrayed by [[Jed Brophy]].\n\n== History ==\nSharku was the veteran chief of a group of marauding Warg-riders who ranged deep into the realms of [[Gondor]] and [[Rohan]], sowing panic and fear among [[Saruman|Saruman's]] enemies.\n\nBy the time of the [[War of the Ring]], he had thrown his support behind the corrupted [[Wizards|Wizard]], [[Saruman]]. He was tasked by him with ambushing the column of [[Rohirrim]] women and children retreating from [[Edoras]] to the safety of [[Helm's Deep]]. [[Théoden]] and his guard, with the help of [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], and [[Gimli]], fended off the attack. However, during the battle, Aragorn got tangled up in the harness of Sharku's Warg and both the beast and the ranger fell over a cliff. Sharku, mortally wounded, survived just long enough to gloat about Aragorn's apparent death to Legolas and Gimli.\n\n== Etymology ==\n''[[Sharkû]]'' is the [[Black Speech]] word meaning \"Old Man\",<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 763</ref> most likely referring to [[Sharkey]], the name Saruman used when he controlled [[The Shire]].<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>\n\n== Portrayal in adaptations==\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - Rise to War - Sharku.webp|Sharku in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Rise to War]]''\n</gallery>\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{lordoftheringsfilms}}\n\n[[Category:Orcs from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings (film series) characters]]"}}}
