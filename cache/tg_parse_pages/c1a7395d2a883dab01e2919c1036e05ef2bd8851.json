[[16 September|September 16]], [[1951]]) is a New Zealand actor who played an [[Orcs|Orc]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''. He also had an uncredited role as a featured Orc in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]''.\n\nIt must be noted, that [https://aucklandactors.co.nz/actors/robert-pollock/ Auckland Actors] claims Pollock is 64 years old in December of 2024, therefore having been born in 1959 or 1960. However, they also claim that his roles in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] were [[Lugdush]] in 2000 and a \"Hero Orc\" in 2003. This seems dubious since none of the films were released in 2000, nor is the role of Lugdush known to exist in the films.\n\nIn June [[2007]], he and 14 other actors filed [https://us.imdb.com/news/ni0058227/ a lawsuit] against [[New Line Cinema]] over merchandising royalties.<ref>{{webcite|author=MrCere|articleurl=https://www.theonering.net/torwp/2007/06/01/23983-actors-join-to-sue-new-line-over-lotr-merchandising/|articlename=Actors join to sue New Line over LOTR merchandising|dated=1 June 2007|website=TORN|accessed=3 December 2024}}</ref> The action was settled out of court in October [[2008]].<ref>{{webcite|author=MrCere|articleurl=https://www.theonering.net/torwp/2008/10/08/30205-new-zealand-actors-settle-out-of-court-with-new-line-cinema/|articlename=New Zealand actors settle out of court with New Line|dated=8 October 2008|website=TORN|accessed=3 December 2024}}</ref>\n\n== External links ==\n* {{WP|Robert Pollock (actor)|Robert Pollock}}\n\n{{references}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pollock, Robert}}\n[[Category:Actors and actresses]]\n[[Category:New Zealand people]]\n[[Category:People by name]]\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings (film series) cast]]"}}}
