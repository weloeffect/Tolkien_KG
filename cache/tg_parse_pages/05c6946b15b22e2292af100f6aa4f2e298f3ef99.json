Those kept in the Lockholes were treated to harsh conditions and starved.  Fredegar was no longer fat; in fact [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] had to help him to walk out.  Lobelia looked old and thin although she was able to hobble out on her own two feet; still, she died a few months later.  Will Whitfoot was debilitated enough that Frodo took on the job of Deputy Mayor until Will could regain his strength.<ref>{{RK|VI9}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Samwise Gamgee]]'s poem, ''Perry-the-Winkle'',<ref>{{AB|Preface}}</ref> the [[Lonely Troll]] sat and wept outside of the Lockholes gate because he had no friends.  There [[Perry-the-Winkle]] befriended the [[Troll]] who in gratitude took him home where they had a \"fulsome [[tea]]\".  The inclusion of the word ''Lockholes'' indicates that Sam wrote the poem after the [[War of the Ring]].<ref>{{AB|Perry}}, poem number 8</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Buildings]]\n[[Category:Eriador]]\n[[Category:The Shire]]\n\n[[de:Loch]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/villes tours et forteresses/comte/trous-prisons]]\n[[fi:Umpikolot]]"}}}
