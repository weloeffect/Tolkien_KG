In spite of being a Man, he was chosen by the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Ulmo]] to be the last hope of the [[Noldor]] in the face of annihilation by the forces of [[Morgoth]].\n\nBorn in the winter of the [[Year of Lamentation]], Tuor's life coincided with the final defeat of the Edain and the Noldor-in-Exile by the forces of Morgoth. He was of the [[House of Hador]], but after the deaths of his parents [[Huor]] and [[Rían]] in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], he was fostered by the surviving [[Elves of Mithrim]]. He passed his youth a refugee and an outlaw, before being guided by the Vala Ulmo to the hidden city of [[Gondolin]]. There he rose high in the favour of the [[High King of the Noldor|High King]] [[Turgon]] and wedded the elf-maiden [[Idril]], the King's daughter. Escaping the [[Fall of Gondolin]], he and his family came to the [[Mouths of Sirion]]. After abiding there long enough to see Eärendil to manhood, Tuor finally succumbed to his [[sea-longing]] and, with Idril, departed [[Middle-earth]] for the [[Aman|West]]. The tradition of the Noldor was that he became the only Man to be accepted as one of the [[Elves|elder kindred]] and will share with them an immortal life in [[Valinor]] as long as [[Arda]] will endure.<ref name=\"S23\">{{S|23}}</ref><ref name=\"Letter153\">{{L|153}}</ref>\n\n==Family and heritage==\nHis father Huor and his elder brother [[Húrin]] were fostered with their kin in [[Brethil]]. They were of the House of Hador, but also descended from the [[House of Haleth]] through their mother [[Hareth]]. During a battle following the [[Dagor Bragollach]], the brothers escaped the hordes of Morgoth with the aid of Ulmo, and [[Thorondor]] brought them to Gondolin. Ulmo counselled King Turgon to treat them as guests, as help would come to him from their House. After they learnt much from the [[Gondolindrim]], Turgon reluctantly waived his law and let them leave on a condition of silence.<ref name=\"RuinOfBeleriand\">{{S|18}}</ref>\n\nOn his return, Huor married Rían of the [[House of Bëor]]. Thus Tuor was a descendant of all the Three Houses of the Edain. When Tuor was conceived, Huor gave him his name before he was born. Months later Huor fell in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] defending the retreat of Turgon, speaking his last words to the Elven King: \"...out of your house shall come the hope of Elves and Men... from you and from me a new [[Star of Eärendil|star]] shall arise\".<ref>{{CH|2}}, p. 58</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Anke Eißmann - The Fostering of Tuor.jpg|thumb|''The Fostering of Tuor'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]\nAfter hearing news of the battle, Rían became distraught and left [[Dor-lómin]] to wander alone in the wild. She was rescued by the [[Sindar]] of [[Mithrim]] who took her to their dwelling in the [[Mountains of Mithrim|mountains]]. Before the end of the year Tuor was born and was given to the [[Elves of Mithrim]] to be fostered. Rían, having heard from [[Annael]], the leader of the Elves, the news of Huor's death, made her way to [[Haudh-en-Ndengin]], where she laid down in grief and died.<ref name=\"TurinTurambar\">{{S|21}}</ref>\n\nSoon after, [[Hithlum]] was occupied by the [[Swarthy Men]] who had joined Morgoth in the Nírnaeth. Annael and his people therefore took refuge in the caves of [[Androth]], where Tuor spent his youth. At the age of sixteen, Tuor wished to make war upon the Orcs and the [[Incomers]] who oppressed the land of his fathers, but was forbidden by Annael. Rather, in {{FA|488}}, the group resolved to flee Hithlum by the [[Annon-in-Gelydh]] and make their way to the [[Mouths of Sirion]]. Soon after setting out, however, they were assailed by [[Orcs]] and forced to scatter into the night. Tuor, however, refused to flee, and stood his ground, slaying many enemies before being captured.\n\n===Journeys in the Wild===\n[[File:Jenny Dolfen - And his heart was filled with longing.jpg|thumb|''And his heart was filled with longing'' by [[Jenny Dolfen]]]]\nTuor was thrall in the House of [[Lorgan]], chief of the [[Easterlings]] of Dor-lómin, for three years. He was treated harshly because Lorgan knew of his lineage, but nevertheless endured the torment until he found his opportunity to escape. Upon being sent into the woods on an errand, he slew his guards and, escaping pursuit, returned to the caves of Androth. For the next four years he dwelt alone there as an outlaw, slaying many Easterlings and accumulating a large price on his head. He was seeking the Annon-in-Gelydh &ndash; the 'Gate of the Noldor' through the [[Ered Lómin]], by which Annael had intended to escape Hithlum unnoticed. After years of searching, the Vala Ulmo, who had long ago chosen Tuor as his instrument, sent him a sign that finally led him to the Gate of the Noldor. Upon reaching its entrance, Tuor met [[Gelmir (messenger of Círdan)|Gelmir]] and [[Arminas]], messengers of [[Círdan]] who were seeking a way to [[Gondolin]], and they showed him the path through the mountains to [[Nevrast]].\n\nIn {{FA|495}}, Tuor passed through Nevrast and became the first Man to reach the shores of [[Belegaer]], the Great Sea, and felt for the first time the sea-longing that would stay with him the rest of his life. He lingered by Belegaer until the autumn, and then after receiving another sign from Ulmo, followed seven [[swans]] southward. These led him to the abandoned city of [[Vinyamar]] where long ago Turgon had dwelt and, at the behest of Ulmo, left a sword, armour and a shield bearing the device of a white swan on a blue field. Tuor took these arms and made his way to the shore. Then during a great storm the Lord of Waters finally appeared to Tuor directly, ordering him to seek the city of Gondolin, and giving him a cloak that had a power to hide him from foes. The next morning he met [[Voronwë]], an elf of Gondolin who had been shipwrecked off the coast of Beleriand, rescued, and brought to Vinyamar by Ulmo. After hearing Tuor speak the words of Ulmo,  Voronwë agreed to guide him to the hidden gate of Gondolin.\n\n===Life in Gondolin===\n[[File:Peter Xavier Price - Tuor's sighting at Lake Ivrin.jpg|thumb|left|''Tuor's sighting at Lake Ivrin'' by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]]\nVoronwë led Tuor through the [[Woods of Núath]], a land desolated by the recent passing of [[Glaurung]] the Dragon to [[Nargothrond]]. At the [[Pools of Ivrin]] Tuor caught a brief glimpse of his ill-fated cousin [[Túrin]], son of Hurin, as he cried for [[Finduilas]] &ndash; the only time their two paths ever crossed. Then after enduring a [[Fell Winter (First Age)|bitter winter]] Tuor and Voronwë finally reached the gate of Gondolin. They were taken as prisoners by [[Elemmakil]] and brought before [[Ecthelion|Ecthelion of the Fountain]] who, recognising from his arms that Tuor had been sent by Ulmo, welcomed them into the city with honour. Tuor then came before the High King Turgon and delivered the message of Ulmo: the [[Doom of Mandos]] was nearing its fulfilment and Turgon should abandon his city and retreat to the [[Mouths of Sirion|Havens of Sirion]].\n[[File:Šárka Škorpíková - Idril, Earendil, Tuor.jpg|thumb|''Idril, Earendil, Tuor'' by [[:Category:Images by Šárka Škorpíková|Šárka Škorpíková]]]]\nTurgon however chose not to heed Ulmo's warning, though it did prompt him to block up the hidden door and make Gondolin's isolation complete. Therefore Tuor remained in Gondolin, and like his father before him, he learned much from the Elves. He fell in love with [[Idril|Idril Celebrindal]], the daughter of the King, and she with him, and in {{FA|502}} they were married.<ref>{{WJ|P3}}, note 18.</ref> This [[Unions of Elves and Men|union]], as well as the favour of the King and the memory of his father, endeared Tuor to the people of Gondolin and he was made the leader of the [[House of the Wing]]. Only [[Maeglin]] harboured a secret hatred and jealousy of him.\n\nSoon after their union a [[Half-elven]] was born to Tuor and Idril, who was named [[Eärendil]] or 'Sea-friend', reflecting the 'sea-longing' Tuor passed to his son.<ref name=\"Letter297\">{{L|297}}</ref>\n\n===Fall of Gondolin===\nBut in {{FA|510}}, Gondolin's secrecy finally failed. First [[Húrin]], Tuor's uncle, released from Morgoth's long torment and attempting to enter the city, revealed its location in the [[Encircling Mountains]]. Still Morgoth would not have found an entrance to the city were it not for the treachery of Maeglin, who having defied the King's order and ventured outside the encircling mountains was captured by Orcs and brought to Angband &ndash; there he betrayed Turgon in return for the promise of the lordship of Gondolin and the possession of Idril.\n[[File:Natalie Chen - Tuor.jpg|thumb|''Tuor'' by [[:Category:Images by Natalie Chen|Natalie Chen]]]]\nDuring the subsequent [[Fall of Gondolin|siege]] Tuor fought valiantly. He rescued Idril from Maeglin, throwing the Elf from the walls of the city to his death. But in the end Gondolin fell and Turgon was killed. Tuor and Idril led the survivors of the sack in a desperate escape through the [[Idril's secret way|secret way]] Idril had prepared and over the mountains. Protected by Ulmo they journeyed down the vale of [[Sirion]] to the Havens at its mouth &ndash; the last refuge of the Elves of Beleriand. On the way the remnant of Gondolin stopped in [[Nan-tathren]] to make a feast in memory of the fallen, and here Tuor composed ''[[The Horns of Ylmir]]'' for his son Eärendil.\n\n===Fate===\nTuor and Idril dwelt for a while at the Mouths of Sirion. But eventually the sea-longing that had been instilled in him when he first came to the shores of Belegaer grew too strong. In {{FA|525}} he built a ship, [[Eärrámë]] ([[Quenya|Q]]: 'Sea-wing'), and sailed to the [[Aman|West]] with Idril, and possibly [[Voronwë]] also.<ref name=\"WJ-TYears\">{{WJ|Years}}</ref> It was a tradition under the [[Eldar]] and [[Edain]] that they arrived in [[Valinor]], and that Tuor alone of Men was counted among the Eldar, immortal as other Elves.<ref group=\"note\">Apparently by the special will of [[Ilúvatar]] himself; see [[Letter 153]].</ref>\n\nHowever Huor's prophecy on the field of Nírnaeth Arnoediad proved true. In the same year that Tuor and Idril departed, Eärendil married [[Elwing]]. At first seeking after his father, he sailed to Valinor and roused the Valar to the [[War of Wrath]], and so became the prophesied saviour of the Elves and Men of Middle-earth. Through Eärendil, Tuor was an ancestor of the [[Half-elven]] and the [[Kings of Númenor]].\n\n==Characteristics==\nTuor was \"fair of face\" and inherited the golden hair of the [[House of Hador]]. As a man he was \"strong and tall and valiant\" and skilled at arms. But, being raised by Elves, he also had great lore and skill.<ref name=\"UT1p23-24\">{{UT|1}}, pp. 23-24</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Tuor'' was adapted to [[Sindarin]] from the language of the [[Edain]],<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, pp. 348, 364 (note 49)</ref><ref group=\"note\">In a draft for a letter, Tolkien used the form ''Túor'' (cf. [[Letter 153]]).</ref> but its original meaning is not glossed.\n\nIn ''[[The Etymologies]]'', [[Noldorin]] ''Tuor'' (\"strength-vigour\") derives from [[Common Eldarin]] ''tūghor, tū-gor'' ([[Sundocarme|root]] TUG-). In the context of this etymology, ''Tuor'' can likely be analysed as ''[[tû]]'' (\"strength\") + a derivative of root GOR (\"violence, impetus, haste\").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries \"GOR-\", \"TUG-\"</ref>\n\n==Other names==\nTuor bore the epithets '''''Eladar''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] \"Starfather\"), '''''Ulmondil''''' ([[Quenya|Q.]] \"Friend of Ulmo\")<ref>{{WJ|West}}, ''(ii) The House of Hador'', p. 235</ref> and '''[[the Blessed]]'''.<ref name=\"TheBlessed\">{{GA|144}}</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\nHis paternal grandfather [[Galdor (Lord of Dor-lómin)|Galdor]] was the [[Lord of Dor-lómin]],<ref name=\"SComingOfMen\">{{S|17}}.</ref> so Tuor technically inherited that title after the death of his cousin [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]] in {{FA|499}}, though by that time Dor-lómin had long since ceased to exist as a realm of the Edain. In [[Gondolin]] he was made the Lord of the [[House of the Wing]].\n\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | MAR | | HAL | | BEO | | | | | | |MAR=[[Marach]]<br/><small>''[[House of Hador]]''</small>|HAL=[[Haldad]]<br/><small>''[[House of Haleth]]''</small>|BEO=[[Bëor]]<br/><small>''[[House of Bëor]]''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | |:| | | |:| | | |:| | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | |:| | | |:| | | |:| | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | GAL |y| HAR | | |:| TUR |y| ELE |GAL=[[Galdor (Lord of Dor-lómin)|Galdor]]<br/><small>''{{FA|417}} - [[First Age 462|462]]''</small>|HAR=[[Hareth]]<br/><small>''born {{FA|417}}''</small>|TUR=[[Turgon]]<br /><small>''{{YT|1300}} - {{FA|510}}''</small>|ELE=[[Elenwë]]<br/><small>''born during {{YT}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | |,|-|^|-|.| | | |:| | | |!| | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | MOR |y| HUR | | HUO |y| RIA | | |!| | | |MOR=[[Morwen]]<br/><small>''{{FA|443}} - c.

Tolkien]]: \"[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]\", which became part of ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. \n\nThe tale begins without mentioning Tuor's early life and lineage, though later he introduces himself to the [[Gondothlim]] as \"''Tuor son of [[Peleg]] son of [[Indor]] of the [[house of the Swan]] of the sons of the Men of the North''\".<ref name=\"Gondolin\">{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|160}} He was from the folk of [[Dor Lómin]], but he did not dwell with them, but lived in the woods of [[Mithrim]], singing with is harp. Now, his singing called the attention of other men, so he departed to lonely places. Thus destiny brought him to a cavern, and guided there by some [[Noldoli]], he crossed the [[Golden Cleft]] to the sea. There he built a house, which was called [[Falasquil]]. One day he saw three swans flying by the shore, and decided to follow them, for he had chosen the Swan as a emblem. Thus he reached a [[Sirion|river]], full of birds, and amid them he lost the sight of the swans. Then a group of [[Noldoli]] took him through the fenland region of [[Arlisgion]] and hence to the [[Nan-tathren|Land of Willows]]. Here Tuor tarried long time, for he was amazed with the trees and insects that lived there, but Ulmo appeared to him directly and ordered him to seek Gondolin.<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|149–55}}\n\nTuor began his journey northwards seeking for the city with the help of wandering [[Gnomes]], but all of them abandoned him fearing Melko's creatures, but the Gnome [[Voronwë]] remained faithful and encouraged Tuor. Thus they reached an enchanted gate, which was hidden to any eye save for those Noldoli who escaped from Melko. After crossing a long and dark tunnel, they came to the light of a great plain, and in the middle they saw the city upon [[Amon Gwareth]]. The guards welcomed them and explained Tuor the [[Gondolin#The Seven Names|seven names of the city]].<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|156–8}}\n\nAfter a day of march, Tuor and Voronwë entered Gondolin, greeted with awe by its people, and were taken before King [[Turgon]]. There Tuor, given the power and majesty of Ulmo's own voice, told Turgon to gather his forces and attack Melko as the time for his overthrow was ripe. Turgon refused this counsel and so Tuor warned him that both [[Elves]] and [[Men]] would suffer for a long time before the [[Valar]] could contrive another means of salvation. However Tuor voiced Ulmo's other [[Ulmo's warning|counsel]]: to leave Gondolin, travel down the Sirion, build ships and sail back to [[Valinor]] to ask  the Gods for help against Melko. Again Turgon refused, which caused Tuor a great sadness. Sitting beside the fountain of the king, he longed for the sea, but Turgon invited him to dwell in Gondolin, even in the king's halls, and he accepted, as he was weary. There he learned many things that would otherwise be kept secret from the race of Men. Matters of music, lore, architecture and culture were all taught to him and he became beloved in the city. Turgon had a suit of armour made for him and an axe, [[Dramborleg]]. Some years later he married Turgon's daughter [[Idril]] at [[Gar Ainion]], and [[Meglin]], the king's nephew, became jealous of them. In those days the desire of the Valar was fulfilled because Idril bore Tuor a son: [[Eärendel]].<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|160–5}}\n\nAt some point, a worried Idril asked Tuor to build a [[Idril's secret way|secret tunnel]] from their house to out of the city. He did not understand its purpose clearly, but answered \"''better is any plan than a lack of counsel''\".<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|168}} Some years later, Idril's concerns increased, and she [[Foresight|foretold]] him that the day was coming in which he would have to make a choice. She also asked him to gather a guard of faithful men and gave them his emblem, while she convinced his father to allow Tuor to make his own house and become a lord of the city.<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|170–1}} Thus was made the bodyguard of Tuor, the [[house of the Wing]] which was counted as the [[Twelve houses of the Gondothlim|twelfth house of Gondolin]].<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|174}} \n[[File:Tom Loback - Tuor slays Othrod.jpg|thumb|''Tuor slays Othrod'' by [[Tom Loback]]]]\nWhen the [[Fall of Gondolin]] began, Tuor proposed to abandon the city to save its women and children, but King Turgon followed Meglin's advice of facing siege.<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|175}} Tuor led his men to his house to say farewell to Idril and Eärendel before joining battle. But once there he found Meglin and the [[folk of the Mole]] capturing his family, \"and lo! Tuor gives a shout so great that the Orcs hear it afar and waver at the sound of it\". Seeing Tuor, Meglin tried to stab Eärendel, but the father jumped across the enemy and seized Meglin, took him by the middle and ghim out the walls to the fire. Then Tuor left [[Voronwë]] and some of his men with [[Idril]], and took the rest to the battle in the gate.<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|177–8}}\n\nNear the gate Tuor and his folk joined the battle alongside the [[house of the Fountain]], but soon some [[dragons]] pulled down the western walls of the city and enemies poured in. The wings in Tuor's helm blackened with the dragon flames, but he stood commanding all the men around. There he slain three [[Orcs|orc-lords]]: [[Othrod]], [[Balcmeg]] and [[Lug]]; as well as five [[Balrogs]]. Eventually he was forced to retreat bearing the injured Ecthelion. After being rescued by [[Galdor of the Tree|Galdor]] in the [[Square of the Folkwell]], he rallied what remained of the defenders of the city and made for the [[Square of the Palace|King's Square]].<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|180–2}}\n\nTuor, with help of [[Glorfindel]], cleansed the Square of enemies, and later kept its defence with the help of [[Egalmoth]] in what is known as the bravest stand in all stories. However, a dragon entered followed by [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog, lord of Balrogs]] and Tuor and Egalmoth would have perished, but Ecthelion came to their aid and slew the Balrog, going to his own death in the attempt. At this point Turgon conceded the city was lost and refused to fight or leave, ordering Tuor to lead the survivors out of the city. Tuor was divided between his loyalty to the King and the love to his family, but chose to lead the survivors.<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|183–6}} After they crossed the secret tunnel, they emerged onto the plain of [[Tumladin]] and ran to the Mountains for the whole night. With the rising of the sun, Tuor rescued Eärendel, who had fled the city earlier with a servant called [[Hendor]], from a pack of [[wolf-riders]]. Once reunited with their son, Tuor and Idril explained him the end of Gondolin.<ref name=\"Gondolin\" />{{rp|189–91}}\n\n[[Tolkien]] never finished ''The Book of Lost Tales'', so there are contradictory outlines about the end of Tuor: first he sails alone in secret in his ship Alqarámë.<ref name=\"Earendel\">{{LT2|V}}, pp. 253-4</ref> But later it is given a more detailed outline of his depart:\n\n{{blockquote|One evening he calls Eärendel and they go to the shore.
