His father was a fisherman and his mother died in childbirth. In {{SA|1965}}, his home was attacked by the K'prur people from the neighbouring kingdom of Hent. His father was mortally wounded, and Dwar vowed revenge. He left his home and traveled to the mainland realm of the Wôlim, where he became a skilled warrior and scout. In {{SA|1969}}, he began studying ancient magical arts and became a Mage.\n\nIn {{SA|1980}}, Dwar returned to Waw as the Lord of Dogs. With a small group of warriors and a pack of warhounds, he retook the citadel of Alk Waw from the K'prur. He became the High-lord of the isle, ruling without convening the traditional Elder Councils. The island became known as the Isle of Dogs. He used his growing power and a newly built fleet to plunder coastal towns and conquer neighbouring islands, incorporating them into his kingdom.\n\nAt the height of his power, he accepted a [[Nine Rings|Ring of Power]] from [[Sauron]], and withdrew from public life. His armies successfully conquered Hent while his nephew became the new Lord of Dogs. Dwar ruled his kingdom from the shadows, manipulating his heirs for the next 252 years.\n\nIn {{SA|2250}}, Dwar left Waw and moved to Sauron's fortress, [[Barad-dûr]], where he bred war-wolves. He fled back to Waw when Sauron was captured by the [[Númenóreans]], but returned to Mordor after the [[Downfall of Númenor]] to continue his work. Many of his creations were slaughtered in the [[War of the Last Alliance]], and he passed into the shadows.\n\nDwar reappeared around {{TA|1050}}, briefly residing with Sauron in [[Dol Guldur]] before returning to Waw. For the next 589 years, he ruled there from the shadows. He was recalled to the West in {{TA|1640}} to help prepare Mordor for Sauron's return. He continued his work breeding war-hounds and participated in the capture of [[Minas Morgul|Minas Ithil]].\n\nDuring the [[Watchful Peace]], Dwar followed Sauron eastward and was contested by the [[Blue Wizards]]. He returned to Mordor in {{TA|2941}} to help rebuild Barad-dûr.\n\nDuring the [[War of the Ring]], Dwar rode with the Black Riders in search of the [[The One Ring|One Ring]]. After his fruitless search, he joined the remaining wraiths at the [[Battle of the Morannon]], where he perished with Sauron's defeat.<ref name=ICE/>\n==Weaponry in Middle-earth Role Playing==\nBeyond a [[Morgul-knife]], the Ringwraith is noted to have possessed the following weapons:\n*'''War-dancer''': A falchion made of [[Metals_in_Middle-earth_Role_Playing#Ogamur|ithilnaur]] and inlaid with white gold and pearl. A dagger was sheathed in the hilt, with the falchion's pearl-tipped pommel being its end.<ref>{{ICE|2010}},  p. 49</ref>\n* '''Air-cleaver''': A gé or killing-[[wikipedia:bolas|bola]]. This enchanted Braric weapon was made of silvery [[Metals_in_Middle-earth_Role_Playing#Ogamur|ogamur]].<ref>{{ICE|2010}},  p. 15</ref>\n{{References}}\n{{Nazgûl in adaptations}} \n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nazgûl 3}}\n[[Category:Undead from adaptations]]\n[[Category:Middle-earth Role Playing characters]]"}}}
