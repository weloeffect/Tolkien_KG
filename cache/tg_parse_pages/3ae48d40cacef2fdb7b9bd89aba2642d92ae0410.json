Tolkien]]'s [[legendarium]], published in the final volumes of ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''. In this version, the setting of his legendarium is more scientifically realistic and less mythological: the Earth was always round, and [[Arda]] was the name for the whole solar system instead of just the Earth.\n\nIn the Round World version the [[Sun]] and the [[Moon]] were not the fruit of the [[Two Trees of Valinor|Two Trees]], but actually preceded their creation, and the [[Two Lamps]] which preceded them all in the [[Flat World]] cosmology had never truly existed and were instead a subject of Númenórean legend. The significance of the Trees and the [[Silmarils]] was that they preserved the light of the Sun before it was tainted by [[Morgoth|Melkor]] when he ravished [[Arien]]. The Moon in this tale was instead a remnant of the [[First War]] from a time when Melkor sought to destroy all the earth but could not succeed in his attempts, and the Moon is what broke away from Arda in the destruction. However, another tale from this cosmology tells that the Valar wrought the Moon out of the earth to counteract the night when Melkor was most active.\n\nSimilarly, the [[stars]] were not created with the [[Awakening of the Elves]], but the occluding clouds were removed to reveal them, and it wasn't Varda who kindled them, since her power was limited to Arda while the stars were set in [[Eä]].\n\n== History ==\nTolkien himself did not believe the earth was flat or had ever been so, but chose to depict the \"primeval world\" of his legendarium as \"flat and bounded\" due to his affinity for the myths of \"ancient men.\"<ref>{{L|131}}</ref><ref>{{L|154}}</ref>\n\nAlready in the early stages of the Legendarium, while writing [[Ambarkanta]], Tolkien considered making [[Ambar]] always a globe, but the known regions were barred within impassable mountain walls that hid the rest of the world.<ref name=Ambar>{{SM|Ambar}}</ref>{{rp|242–243}}\n\nTolkien first experimented writing a round world version of the ''[[Ainulindalë (Morgoth's Ring)#Ainulindalë C*|Ainulindalë]]'' and ''The Fall of Númenor'', in a time before the writing of ''[[The Return of the King]]''. In that draft of the ''Ainulindale'', the [[Sun]] already exists. Having sent both [[Ainulindalë (Lost Road)|the \"Flat World\"]] and the \"Round World\" versions to Katherine Ferrar in [[1948]], she replied that she preferred the old version better because \"The hope of Heaven is the only thing which makes modern astronomy tolerable: otherwise there must be an East and a West and Walls: aims and choices and not an endless circle of wandering\". Christopher Tolkien guesses that her commentary influenced his father to return to the flat-earth model, but he didn't totally abandon it.<ref>{{MR|P1f}}</ref><ref>{{SD|Drowning}}</ref>\n\nReferences to the seas being first \"bent\" after the Fall of Númenor, to the \"Sunless Years,\" and to the trolls of the Twilight survived in ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref name=\"house\">{{FR|Bombadil}}</ref><ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref><ref>{{FR|Three}}</ref><ref>{{App|Other}}</ref> However, these may be interpreted as statements made by characters which reflect their own understanding of their world, rather than authorial declarations of objective fact.\n\nThe Round World mythology emerged again in writings between 1958-1960, but it was never developed beyond the stage of drafting and Tolkien didn't continue the revisions. Thus the Flat World version was chosen by [[Christopher Tolkien]] for the published ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.<ref>{{MR|Myths}}</ref>\n\nTowards the end of his life, Tolkien put forth an alternative which permitted Arda to have been round for the whole history of the [[Secondary World]] without rewriting the existing tales. He recharacterized the ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'' as a compilation of \"traditions... handed on by ''Men'' [...] ''blended and confused with their own Mannish myths and cosmic ideas''\".<ref>{{MR|P5I}}, p. 373</ref>\n\nIn this late view of Tolkien's, \"nearly all the matter of ''The Silmarillion'' is contained in myths and legends that have passed through Men's hands and minds, and are (in many points) plainly influenced by contact and confusion with the myths, theories, and legends of Men\".<ref>{{PM|XIII}}, Note 17, p. 390</ref> Thus, there would be no need for readers in the [[Primary World]] or even characters within the [[Secondary World]] to accept the story of the reshaping of the world as \"geologically or astronomically 'true'\".<ref>{{L|325}}</ref>\n\n== External links ==\n*{{webcite|author=[[Vyacheslav Stepanov]]|articleurl=https://realelvish.net/2024/04/14/it-always-had-been-a-vast-globe/|articlename=\"It Always Had Been a Vast Globe...\"|dated=14 April 2024|website=[https://realelvish.net/ RealElvish.net - Merin Essi ar Quenteli!]|accessed=24 July 2024}}\n*{{webcite|author=[https://m.youtube.com/@TolkienLorePodcast Tolkien Lore Podcast] and [[Vyacheslav Stepanov]]|articleurl=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6n_JSHBAvZY|articlename=“It Was Always a Vast Globe” for Tolkien, to the End of His Life|dated=15 June 2025|website=YT|accessed=15 June 2025}}\n*{{webcite|author=[[Michael Martinez]]|articleurl=https://middle-earth.xenite.org/how-would-j-r-r-tolkien-have-revised-the-middle-earth-mythology/|articlename=How Would J.R.R.
