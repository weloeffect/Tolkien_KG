He grabs a moth that is fluttering by and imparts a message to it before sending it away. Below, the ring of [[Isengard]] has been transformed into a foundry and breeding ground for new [[Orcs]] and the large scale production of equipment. Saruman watches on as new [[Uruk-hai]] are bred, including a formidible Uruk named [[Lurtz]].\n\n==Differences==\n*Lurtz is an original character to this adaptation.\n*Gandalf does not send a message to the outer world at Orthanc.\n*The entirety of this scene is fabricated for the movie in order to depict Saruman's rise as a power, though it largely adheres to how Tolkien describes Isengard. \n{{title}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring scenes|20]]"}}}
