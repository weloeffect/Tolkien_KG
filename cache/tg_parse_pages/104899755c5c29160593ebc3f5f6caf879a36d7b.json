Renowned seers gather at the Royal Court in Fornost to contemplate the obscure visions of the Palantir. To the east the Witch-King of Angmar is poised like a hungry wolf, anxious to devour the last remaining Dunedain Kingdom. \n\nAgainst this threat stand a few whose noble heritage is obscured by the course clothing of the frontier.
