Lately, he has been worried about troubles in the south and thinks it would be wise to arm the four towns of [[Bree-land]]. He asked the [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] [[Grof]] to create weapons to arm the [[Bree-landers]], but the Dwarf refused. Therefore, Otto sent [[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]], [[Andriel]] and [[Farin (video game character)|Farin]] to Grof to convince him. This was successful, and Grof returned to the [[Blue Mountains]] to forge weapons for Otto.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], ''Forewarned is Forearmed''</ref> This would however cost at least three months, while Otto feared they would need weapons earlier. Otto asked Eradan, Andriel and Farin to bring weapons to him, if they would find them on their journeys.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], ''Otto's Arsenal''</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Grof]]\n*[[Captain Brackenbrook]]\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Men from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: War in the North characters]]"}}}
