In the bustling streets of Bozisha-Dar, foreigners suffer at the hands of pickpockets, swindlers, and servants of the Dark Lord. This module features 3 complete adventures. All are self-contained and can easily be used in other locales. \n\nVisit the great cosmopolitan port called the Dar, the jewel of Far Harad. In the Sevet Kovina, the Festival Quarter, traders and rouges from dozens of lands jostle shoulders amidst the revelry. In the Seller's Court spices and silk vie with ivory and animal pelts from [[Mûmakan]] for the bargainer's eye. Anything can be bought - for a price! And on the Katedrala, the hill where the mansions of the wealthy stand beneath lush palms, dark schemes and political intrigue seethe among the nobility. Within one ornate palace lurks evidence of the Nazgûl's plan to seize the city. \n\nWARLORDS OF THE DESERT features \n\n*2 FULL-COLOR MAPS: including a regional map and a map of the city of Bozisha-Dar \n*3 EXCITING ADVENTURES: a confrontation with thieves in \"The Tangled Streets of Bozisha-Dar,\" a risky rescue attempt in \"Bandits of the Eastern Hills,\" and political intrigue in \"Southern Hospitality\" \n*DETAILED LAYOUTS: of adventure locations \n*STATISTICS: for Far Haradan warriors, NPCs, beasts, and monsters  \n==See also==\n*''[[Far Harad: The Scorched Land]]''\n*''[[Forest of Tears]]''\n*''[[Hazards of the Harad Wood]]''\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:MERP]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]"}}}
