Following the war, Men were scattered in all directions, some of them heading for \"eastern deserts and the southern forests\", but some Men, especially Ermon and his folk, went west, along with some of the Ilkorindi.<ref name=\"Mur\"/>\n\nErmon, accompanied by an Elf called [[Tareg]], eventually arrived to the river [[Sirion]] in the northwest of the [[Great Lands]], where they met the exiled [[Gnomes]], who were about to prepare for a war with Melko. There, they joined forces with them, and, at a place called [[Gorfalong]], fought a [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad#Other versions of the legendarium|great battle]] with Melko and his forces, many of whom were Men corrupted by him.<ref>{{LT1|X}}, p. 240</ref>\n\nErmon's eventual fate is unknown, but he evidently left descendants, since in one outline, [[Ing]] King of [[Luthany]] was said to be one of them.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, p. 305</ref><ref group=\"note\">According to another text, Ing was the descendant of ''both'' Ermon and Elmir.</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''Ermon'' might be in [[Ilkorin]], according to [[Christopher Gilson]], but its meaning is unclear.<ref>[[Christopher Gilson]], \"His Breath Was Taken Away: Tolkien, Barfield, and Elvish Diction\", in {{TS|14}}, p. 37</ref>\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | ERM |ERM='''ERMON'''}}\n{{familytree | |:| }}\n{{familytree | |:| }}\n{{familytree | ING |ING=[[Ing]]}}\n{{familytree | |:| |}}\n{{familytree | |:| |}}\n{{familytree | AEL |AEL=[[Ælfwine]]}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n== Inspiration ==\nThe character of Ermon might have been inspired by [[wikipedia:Ask and Embla|Askr]], the first man created by the gods (out of [[Ashes|ash]]-tree) in the [[wikipedia:Norse mythology|Norse mythology]].<ref>{{LT1|Xn}}, note 9, p. 245</ref>\n\n{{references|notes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ermon}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Ilkorin names]]\n[[Category:Men]]\n[[Category:Rulers in the Great Lands]]\n[[de:Ermon]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/hommes/ermon]]"}}}
