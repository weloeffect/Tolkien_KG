This scene was not featured in the theatrical release of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Éowyn]] walks through a temporary camp the travellers from [[Edoras]] have set up and offers [[Gimli]] some stew. He politely refuses, and she offers it to [[Aragorn]], who accepts it graciously. However, upon taking his first spoonful, he registers it is not as nice as he thought it might be. Regardless of this, he tells Éowyn it is good and as she turns around, he begins spilling it. \n\nShe turns back to Aragorn, whose hands have been somewhat singed by the spilled stew, and asks if he truly did ride to war with [[Thengel]], as [[Théoden]] has told her. \n{{blockquote|King Théoden has a good memory. He was only a small child at the time.|[[Aragorn]] to [[Éowyn]]}}\nÉowyn is shocked by this. Aragorn tells her he is eighty-seven years old. She quickly realises he is one of the [[Dúnedain]]. He tells her there are very few of the Dúnedain left. At this, she apologies and bids him eat the stew, continuing to stand next to him, giving him little choice but to do so. \n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers scenes|32]]"}}}
