To the bottle I go\nTo heal my heart and drown my woe\nRain may fall and wind may blow\nBut there still be\nMany miles to go\nSweet is the sound of the pouring rain\nAnd the stream that falls\nFrom hill to plain\nBetter than rain or rippling brook\nIs a mug of beer inside this Took\n</poem>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:1.07}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring - The Complete Recordings]]"}}}
