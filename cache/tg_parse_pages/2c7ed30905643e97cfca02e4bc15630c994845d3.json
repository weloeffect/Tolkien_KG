This is the equivalent of adding a 'y' after the letter in English to form a single distinct consonant sound.<ref>{{App|Letters}}</ref>  As an example, the sound 'ty' here has the same sound as the initial consonant in the (British pronunciation of) the English word 'tune' - something close to, but distinct from, 'ch'.<ref>{{App|Writing}}, Consonants, TY</ref>\n\nThe names of the tengwar of that series were: [[Tyelpe]], [[ando|Indyo]], [[Thúle|Istyar]], [[anto|Intya]], [[Númen|Nyelle]] and [[Óre|Arya]].<ref>{{VT|46}}</ref>\n\nIn languages like the Western, which made much use of consonants such as our ''ch'', ''j'', ''sh'', Series III was usually applied to these; in which case Series IV was applied to the normal ''k''-series (''[[calmatéma]]''). In Quenya, which possessed besides the ''calmatéma'' both a palatal series (''[http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Tyelpet%C3%A9ma tyelpetéma]'') and a labialize series (''[[quessetema]]''), the palatals were represented by a Fëanorian diacritic denoting ‘following ''y''’ (usually two underposed dots), while Series IV was a ''kw''-series.\n\nThe representation of the sounds here is the same as that employed in transcription and described above, except that here ‘’ch’’ represents the ‘’ch’’ in English ‘’church’’; ‘’j’’ represents the sound of English ‘’j’’, and ‘’zh’’ the sound heard in ‘’azure’’ and ‘’occasion’’.<ref name=\"RotK\">{{App|E2i}}</ref>\n{{References}}"}}}
