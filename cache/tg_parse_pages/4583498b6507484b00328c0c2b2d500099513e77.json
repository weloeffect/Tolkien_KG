He owned a small patch of land, with fields and woods.<ref name=S19>{{S|19}}</ref> He joined his lord [[Barahir]] to the [[Dagor Bragollach]], and fought beside him to the last. He was one of only twelve survivors of the men that had gone to war.<ref name=S18>{{S|18}}</ref> But when he returned home after the war, he found his lands plundered, and Eilinel was nowhere to be found. He joined with Barahir, who had formed a small band of outlaws with the other surviving warriors. They retreated to [[Dorthonion]], where they managed to evade [[Morgoth]]'s troops for several years. \n\nStill uncertain about his wife's fate, Gorlim would at times depart the group alone and in secret, and return to his house to look for Eilinel. Morgoth's spies learned of this, and [[Sauron]] prepared a trap for him. One autumn, as Gorlim again ventured to his old abode, he saw what he thought was Eilinel, shining in the window. He was captured by Sauron's hunters, and tortured for information on the outlaws. After he refused to give any, the hunters promised to reunite him with his wife if he yielded. Gorlim, yearning for his lost love, faltered, and was brought before Sauron. Thinking his wife was captured by the Dark Lord, Gorlim offered the information in exchange for a free life with his wife. Sauron agreed, and after Gorlim had upheld his end of the bargain, revealed why: Eilinel was long dead, and Gorlim would indeed be reunited with her. He was put to death, cruelly. \n\nBarahir and the other outlaws were discovered and killed, except for Barahir's son [[Beren]], who had been on an errand. In a dream, the [[wraith]] of Gorlim appeared to him, and confessed his deeds. The wraith urged Beren to inform his father, but it was too late.<ref name=S19>{{S|19}}</ref>\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| ANG | | | | | |ANG=[[Angrim]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| |!| | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| GOR |~| EIL | |GOR='''GORLIM'''<br /><small>''d. {{FA|460}}''</small>|EIL=[[Eilinel]]<br /><small>''d. {{FA|455}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nIn the first version of the ''[[Lay of Leithian]]'', it was [[Morgoth]] himself, not Sauron, that tricked Gorlim into betraying Barahir.<ref>{{LB|C2}}, pp. 162-5, 169-170</ref>\n\n== Adaptations ==\n'''2014: ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]'''''\n:An artifact known as the \"Frowning Skull\" contains a memory of Sauron interrogating Gorlim and tricking him into betraying his companions. At the end of the memory, it is stated by Sauron that his skull would be kept as a reminder of his irresistible will. The artifact's description also claims that the skull has been treasured by the \"Death's Head\", an assassin cult of Orcs within Mordor for a thousand years prior to the game's events, \"as a symbol of their glorious future free of the scourge of Man\". \n\n{{references}}\n{{outlaws}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:Edain]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:Folk of Bëor]]\n\n[[de:Gorlim]]\n[[fi:Gorlim]]"}}}
