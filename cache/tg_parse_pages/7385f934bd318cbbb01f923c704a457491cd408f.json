To accomplish this, he cooks an enormous Fondue in Mount Chronos. When that is done, he plans to over-bake the world in cheese.\n\nSauraus was once a normal knight who went mad because all of the 7 Rings of Power were sold out and he was only given a coupon.\n\nSauraus \"forges\" his own ring by cutting it out of cheese. In a battle with Sauraus, a figure resembling Isildur takes his ring from him, However, this figure can't handle the ring and gets addicted to drugs. This is where Stinker - a parody of [[Gollum]] - comes in. He steals the ring from its owner and escapes.\n\nTo stop Sauraus the known fellowship begins its quest. Leader is always the mage Alm Gandy. An ''Alm'' is in German a high located meadow. The ringbearer is a former bank accountant named Freddy but during the whole movie is called Frido by his fellows.\n\n== Production ==\nThe movie was recorded in the Swiss Alps and features several notable mountains including Matterhorn near Zermatt, which is made to resemble [[Mount Doom]] but is called Mount Chronos.\n\n== External links ==\n*'''[http://www.ringthing.ch Official website]'''\n\n{{Fan films}}\n\n[[Category:Fan films|Ring Thing]]"}}}
