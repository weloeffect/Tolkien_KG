Guritz]</ref> was an [[Orcs|Orc]] Lieutenant who served under [[Gothmog (Lieutenant of Morgul)|Gothmog]] in the [[Siege of Gondor]] and [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].\n\nGuritz is an original creation for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' film. He is portrayed physically by [[Joel Tobeck]]<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwlSUHH5LwM #56 - Joel Tobeck Interview (Hollywood, Sons Of Anarchy, LOTR, Taika Waititi, Accents, Agents etc.)]</ref> and his voice is provided by [[Craig Parker]].<ref>[http://www.ageofthering.com/atthemovies/cast/craigparker.php Age of the Ring | Craig Parker]</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nDuring the [[Siege of Gondor]], [[Gothmog (Lieutenant of Morgul)|Gothmog]] ordered Guritz to \"release the prisoners\". Guritz yelled \"Catapults\", prompting the [[Orcs]] to fire the decapitated heads of the Gondorian prisoners from [[Osgiliath]] into [[Minas Tirith]].\n\n{{Quote|Late as usual, pirate scum. There's knifework here needs doing. Come on you sea rats, get off your ships.|Guritz during the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]}}\nDuring the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], Guritz waited for the [[Corsairs of Umbar]] in [[Pelargir]] with a battalion of Orcs. When the Corsairs arrived, he remarked that they were late, telling them to get off the ships, as they were \"knifework\" needing doing. The Orc was surprised to see the [[Three Hunters]] jump from the ship. Smiling, due to the small number of enemies, Guritz readied his Scythe. When [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]] and [[Gimli]] charged forward, however, an overwhelming army of [[Oathbreakers|undead warriors]] followed them. Guritz stumbled back in surprise and was trampled by the army.\n\n==Other versions==\n[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'s ''Mount Doom'' expansion identifies him as an \"Advance Captain\",<ref>[https://www.ccgtrader.net/card/7733/advance-captain Advance Captain - Lord of the Rings TCG | CCG Trader]</ref> in contrast with  [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|the film's]] credits, which give [[Joel Tobeck|Tobeck]] the credit of \"Orc Lieutenant I\". The card mentions that the head on the Orc's helmet belonged to the individual who scarred him.\n\n{{References}}\n\n{{Lordoftheringsfilms}}\n\n[[Category:Orcs from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings (film series) characters]]"}}}
