He realized they were very fortunate to have escaped the way they had. He saw that the path that [[Beorn]] had told them to follow came to a \"''doubtful and little used end at the eastern edge of the forest''.\"\n\nAfter a while they came to the [[Long Lake]], and Bilbo marvelled at its size. They came to [[Lake-town]]; a small collection of huts and buildings built on stilts over the water. The ruins of a bigger town could be seen rotting away along the shores.\n\nThe first Dwarf to be unloaded was [[Thorin]], who was barely alive, and Bilbo instructed him to \"''slap your arms and rub your legs.\"'' When Bilbo knocked on the barrels, only six dwarves are able to answer: [[Dwalin]] and [[Balin]] were the worst off; [[Bifur]] and [[Bofur]] were better off, but would not help; [[Fíli]] and [[Kíli]] had a better time of it, and had only a few bruises (Fíli said he hoped he never smelled apples again, as his barrels had been full of the smell); [[Bombur]] was asleep or unconsious; and [[Dori]], [[Nori]], [[Ori]], [[Óin]], and [[Glóin]] were barely alive.\n[[File:David T. Wenzel - Thorin at Laketown.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Thorin at Lake-town - Illustration by [[David T. Wenzel]]]]\nIn Lake-town Thorin requested to see the [[Master of Lake-town]]. He was feasting at the time and all the Dwarves joined him (they were famished with hunger since they had not eaten for several days). They got a warm welcoming, and Thorin, the grandson of Thrór, the king under the mountain, was treated as a hero. The Dwarves' feelings for Bilbo improved and they praised him. But unfortunately Bilbo had such a bad cold that his speeches at the banquet were limited to \"''Thag you very buch''.\"\n\nAfter two weeks at Lake-town, Thorin and Company decided to leave for the [[Lonely Mountain]].\n\n[[Category:The Hobbit chapters|Warm Welcome]]\n[[fi:Lämmin vastaanotto]]"}}}
