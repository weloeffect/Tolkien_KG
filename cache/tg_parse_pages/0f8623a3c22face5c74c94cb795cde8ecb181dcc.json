As he is consumed in the furnace, [[Frodo]] hangs onto the precipice of the [[Sammath Naur]]. [[Sam]] struggles to reach Frodo, who looks down into the furnaces below. ''\"Don't you let go!\"'', Sam cries, and with an effort, Frodo clasps his hand. \n\nThe ring sits on the surface of the furnace for a short time before being unmade in the fires. Immediately, [[Sauron]] howls, and the armies of [[Mordor]] flee from battle at the [[Black Gate]]. The tower of [[Barad-dûr]] crumbles, and the [[Eye of Sauron]] shrinks into nothingness, before sending a shockwave across the land. A look of realisation dawns on the face of [[Gandalf]] who gazes towards Mordor with tears in his eyes, and [[Merry]] shouts Frodo's name in jubilation. The [[Towers of the Teeth]] collapse, and the land surrounding the [[Army of the West|Host of the West]] disintegrates. \n\nBut as Mount Doom undergoes a huge eruption — spewing vast amounts of lava into the air and destroying the nearby [[Nazgûl]] — the celebrations of the members of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] are cut short as they fear Frodo's fate. Gandalf, [[Aragorn]], and [[Gimli]] look on in concern, and [[Pippin]] weeps for Frodo. \n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King scenes|71]]"}}}
