Rateliff provided numerous examples of The Hobbit's influence on Tolkien's legendarium; and \"Tolkien's French connections” by Verlyn Flieger discussed French influences on the development of Bilbo Baggins and his adventures. In discussions with the plenary speakers and other presenters, it became apparent that a book focusing on how The Hobbit influenced the subsequent development of Tolkien's legendarium; was sorely needed.<br><br>\nThis collection of essays fills that need. With Rateliff's and Flieger's papers included, the book presents two chapters on the Evolution of the Dwarven Race, two chapters on Durin's Day examining the Dwarven lunar calendar, and 11 chapters on themes exploring various topics on influences and revisions between The Hobbit.}}\n\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:Scholarly books]]"}}}
