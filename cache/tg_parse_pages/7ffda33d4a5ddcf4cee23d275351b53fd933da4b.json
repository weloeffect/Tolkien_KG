Immediately past it, the river forms the large lake \"Gladdenmere\", from which it drops into the [[Gladden Fields]] through the \"Gladden Falls\" waterfall.\n\n:The present course of the Gladden River is not natural. During the fighting at the end of the [[Second Age]], massive quakes shook the Misty Mountains. At Kidzul-kâlah, new passages opened leading deep below the surface, where [[Nameless things]] dwelt. The [[River-woman|River-maiden]] of Gladden, \"Gultháva\", sensed the approach of evil that was about to corrupt her waters. She bade the dwarves leave, and called forth the waters to flood their mines. The waters of the Gladden did not drown the Nameless creatures as she hoped, but their spread to the surface was halted. The changed course of the Gladden carried the sediment downstream, choking the Gladdenmere until its banks overflowed. Water poured over the cliff, flooding the valley and submerging its roads. In this way, the Gladden Fields became a wide marsh of reeds and dark pools. In time the level of the lake was restored, and the Gladden Falls became the narrow torrent that can be observed in the present day.\n\n{{References}} \n[[Category:Rhovanion]]\n[[Category:Rivers]]\n[[de:Schwertel]]\n[[fi:Kurjenmiekkajoki]]"}}}
