However, it is unclear whether the land marked on the Third Age map as Dol Amroth was known by that name when Aldarion visited it.<ref name=Note>{{UT|4a}}, note 6</ref>\n\nPeace and obscurity in Amdír's realm lasted until the [[Downfall of Númenor]] and the subsequent return of [[Sauron]] to [[Middle-earth]].<ref name=\"AaN\"/> Though he answered the call of [[Gil-galad]] to the [[War of the Last Alliance]], he was not disposed to serve under the [[High King of the Noldor]]. Instead, he brought \"''as large a force as he could muster''\" and joined forces with the greater army of [[Silvan Elves]] under King [[Oropher]], the Sindarin-lord of the [[Woodland Realm]].<ref name=\"Princes\">{{UT|6b}}</ref>\n\nIll-equipped compared to the [[Noldor]] and highly independent, the Silvan Elves suffered heavy losses in the [[Battle of Dagorlad]]. It was there that Amdír and more than half his army perished, being cut off from the main host and driven into the [[Dead Marshes]].<ref name=\"Princes\"/>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word ''[[amdir (Sindarin word)|amdir]]'', without the long ''í'', is recorded as a word for \"Hope\", or \"looking up\", in [[Sindarin]].<ref>{{MR|P4c}}, p. 320</ref> \nHowever, the name '''''Amdír''''' with a long ''i'' may rather possibly derive from a shortened form of Sindarin ''[[dîr]]'' (meaning an \"adult male\"), chiefly used as ending in proper names.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry \"[[DER]]\"</ref>\n\nThe King of Lórien is called '''''Malgalad''''' in one text, detailing the fate of the Sindarin kings in the [[Battle of Dagorlad]]. [[Christopher Tolkien]] argues that, since they are contemporaries and both described as Kings that died in the Battle of Dagorlad, they are likely the same. It is unclear however which form was abandoned. ''Malgalad'' likely means \"Gold-shine\", from ''[[malt]]'' (\"gold, the metal)\"<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry \"[[SMAL]]\"</ref> and ''[[galad]]'' (\"light, radiance, glittering, reflection from jewels, glass or polished metal, or water)\"<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}} \"The Names of Finwë's Descendants\"</ref> or \"Golden-tree\", from the outdated spelling of ''[[galadh]]''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry \"[[GAL]]\"</ref>\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| AMD | | | | |AMD='''AMDÍR'''<br /><small>''d. {{SA|3434}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| |!| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree| AMR |~| NIM |AMR=[[Amroth]]<br /><small>''d. {{TA|1981}}''</small>|NIM=[[Nimrodel]]<br/><small>''fl. {{TA|1981}}''}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n{{references|notes}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Amdir}}\n\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n| race=sindar\n| house=\n| born=Before {{SA|730}}\n| died={{SA|3434}}\n}}\n{{seq\n|pvac=None\n| prev=New title\n| list=1st [[King of Lórien|King]] of [[Lothlórien|Lórien]]\n| dates=c. {{FA|587}}{{fact}} - {{SA|3434}}\n| next=[[Amroth]]\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n\n[[Category:Moriquendi]]\n[[Category:Rulers in Middle-earth]]\n[[Category:Second Age characters]]\n[[Category:Sindar]]\n[[de:Amdír]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/elfes/teleri/sindar/amdir]]\n[[fi:Amdír]]"}}}
