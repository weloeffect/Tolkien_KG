Umuiyan advised her to leave, as she was trespassing on the ground of Tevildo. Stroking his ego, Tinúviel addressed him as \"Lord\" and asked to be taken to the Prince, as she had urgent information for him. Umuiyan grabbed her and flung the [[Elfs|Elven]] maiden onto his back, leaping onto the second terrace. After Tinúviel dismounted, Umuiyan yawned and told the Prince of Tinúviel's arrival.\n\nAfter a brief conversation, in which Tinúviel told Tevildo of [[Huan#Other versions of the legendarium|Huan's]] affliction, Tevildo bade Umuiyan lead Tinúviel within the palace. Again, Umuiyan mounted Tinúviel on his back and began to ascend the terraces toward the castle. On his third jump, Umuiyan stumbled and Tinúviel cried out in fear. Unbeknownst to Umuiyan, Tinúviel had undertaken a Labour in which she fashioned her enchanted hair into a garment which would cause any who touched it, other than herself, to become drowsy and fall asleep. Tevildo accused Umuiyan of being clumsy-footed and told him it was time for his employ to end if he had indeed aged so. Umuiyan denied it had anything to do with age and told the Prince that \"a mist is before my eyes and my head is heavy\" before drunkenly staggering and laying down, deep in sleep. Tevildo let out a furious yell which beckoned his thanes and he told them to bind Umuiyan and to cast him from the cliffs \"on the northern side where they fall most sheer, for he is of no use more to me, for his age has robbed him of his sureness of foot\".<ref>{{LT2|I}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Miaulë]]\n* [[Oikeroi]]\n* [[Tevildo]]\n* [[Lúthien#Other versions of the legendarium|Tinúviel]]\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Cats]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Qenya names]]\n[[Category:Servants of Melkor]]"}}}
