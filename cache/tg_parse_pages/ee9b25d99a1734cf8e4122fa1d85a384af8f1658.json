Some great beasts (described as ''mûmakil)'' were sent on [[14 March]] by the [[Witch-king]] to pull huge siege-towers and great engines of war to the [[City Wall]] of [[Minas Tirith]].<ref name=\":0\" /> The most notable of these great beasts were ones specifically tasked with pulling the huge battering ram [[Grond]] to [[Minas Tirith]]'s [[Great Gate of Minas Tirith|Great Gate]] to destroy it.<ref>{{Cite DTP|id=LR 5.04.185}}</ref>\n\nWhile the arrows shot from the [[swan-knights]] of [[Dol Amroth]] did little to halt Grond, occasionally some of the great beasts \"would go mad and spread stamping ruin among the\" many [[Orcs of Mordor|Orcs]] which guarded Grond. However the bodies of the tramped Orcs were cast aside and new Orcs replaced the fallen ones just as quickly.<ref>{{Cite DTP|id=LR 5.04.187}}</ref>\n\n==Speculation==\nWhether the great beasts used to pull Grond were ''mûmakil'' or a different type of unknown animals from distant lands, is impossible to say for certain as we lack a more detailed description of the creatures.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King - Great Beasts.jpg|Great beasts in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''|thumb|left|150px]]\n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''\n\n:The great beasts pulling [[Grond (battering ram)|Grond]] are depicted as rhinoceros-like creatures.

However, a new idea is introduced: the creatures called \"great beasts\" were originally used by Dwarves in the Misty Mountains as underground draft animals (depicted as being much smaller than Sauron's beasts of burden). The Dwarves called them ''yurgs''.<ref>[http://pc.ign.com/articles/690/690364p3.html Battle for Middle-earth II - The Dwarves] at [http://pc.ign.com/ IGN], accessed 16 October 2010</ref>\n\n'''2015: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:In the Mordor expansion pack, the great beasts were given the name '''Sulokil'''.
