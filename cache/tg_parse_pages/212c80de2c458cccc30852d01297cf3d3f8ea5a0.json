Despite the injury he was back on set the next day.  \n\nBoth of his parents worked in the film industry: his father John Astin created the character of Gomez Addams in the TV series \"The Addams Family\" while his mother, Patty Duke, won an Oscar for her performance in \"The Miracle Worker\".\n\n==Filmography==\n* [[2010]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest]]'': [[Samwise Gamgee]]\n* [[2006]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king]]'': Samwise Gamgee (archive footage)\n*[[2004]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age]]'': Samwise Gamgee (archive footage)\n*[[2004]]: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' (video game)]]: Samwise Gamgee\n* [[2003]]: ''[[Beyond the Movie: The Return of the King]]'': Himself\n*[[2003]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'': Samwise Gamgee\n*[[2003]]: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'' (video game)]]: Samwise Gamgee\n*[[2003]]: ''[[The Long and Short of It]]'' (director)\n* [[2002]]: ''[[The Making of The Lord of the Rings]]'': Himself\n*[[2002]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'': Samwise Gamgee\n* [[2002]]: ''[[A Day in the Life of a Hobbit]]'': Himself\n* [[2001]]: ''[[Beyond the Movie: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'': Himself\n* [[2001]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'': Samwise Gamgee\n* [[2001]]: ''[[Quest for the Ring]]'': Himself\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [[2004]]: ''[[There and Back Again: An Actor's Tale]]''\n\n==Quotes==\n{{quote|I just wanted to allow whatever essence of goodness there is within me to come forth and to inhabit the role of Sam, because that's what he is: he's goodness, loyalty, decency; that, I think, is his function in the books.|Sean Astin, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Official Movie Guide]]''}}\n{{quote|The Lord of the Rings was just so much enjoyment.
