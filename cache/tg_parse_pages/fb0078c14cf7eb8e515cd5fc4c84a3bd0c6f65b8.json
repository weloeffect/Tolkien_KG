Ho! Ho! to the bottle I go'''\" is the first line of a poem found within the chapter \"[[A Short Cut to Mushrooms]]\" of ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''. According to the chapter, Frodo, Sam, and Pippin have recently left the accompaniment of the High Elves and, to their delight, have found that they \"had filled their bottles with a clear drink, pale golden in colour\". The liquor lightened their spirits and prompted the following song from Sam and Pippin.\n\n==poem==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nHo! Ho! Ho! to the bottle I go\nTo heal my heart and drown my woe.\nRain may fall and wind may blow,\nAnd many miles be still to go,\nBut under a tall tree I will lie,\nAnd let the clouds go sailing by.\n</poem>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2001: {{fotree}}:'''\n:[[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], and [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] sing the song at the [[Green Dragon]], with slightly altered lyrics that incorporate a small part of the [[Bath-songs|bath-song]]:\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nHey Ho to the bottle I go\nTo heal my heart and drown my woe\nRain may fall and wind may blow but there'll still be\nMany miles to go\n\nSweet is the sound of the pouring rain,\nAnd the stream that falls from hill to plain.\nBetter than rain or rippling brook,\nIs a mug of beer inside this [[Took Family|Took]].\n</poem>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Poems in The Lord of the Rings|Poems in ''The Lord of the Rings'']]\n\n[[Category:Poems in The Fellowship of the Ring]]\n[[Category:Songs]]"}}}
