I believe; though I do not understand clearly what they mean; and they seem also to use the same word of the deceits of the Enemy|[[Galadriel]], ''[[The Mirror of Galadriel]]''}}\n\n'''Magic''' in Middle-earth was not explicitly defined by Tolkien, and the term can have various meanings depending on usage and context. For [[Hobbits]], it was a term used to describe processes and abilities of objects which could not be explained outside of their limited lore and knowledge. For Elves and Wizards, what others might call magic was not something special or different from the natural world,<ref name=\"L155\">{{L|155}}</ref> just a part of it that was not immediately visible. This led to the more common categorization of things as [[Seen]] or [[Unseen]], with the Seen aspects of an object or person being only part of it. Through the power of [[the One Ring]], [[Frodo Baggins]] at times saw powerful Elves, such as the High-elf [[Glorfindel]], in their true level of power and radiance that extends into the Unseen.<ref name=\"Many\"/>\n\n==Magic by race==\n===Ainur magic===\nThe [[Ainur]], as supernatural or angelic beings, could shape the world around them in terms according to their natures. Melkor, later [[Morgoth]], had great power but he could only mar or corrupt what his brethren had already wrought.<ref name=\"Ainu\">{{S|Ainu}}</ref> As explained in ''Morgoth's Ring'', \"to gain domination over Arda, Morgoth had let most of his being pass into the ''physical'' constituents of the Earth\". This meant that everything which was born or lived on Earth, such as beasts, plants, and incarnate spirits, were likely to be tainted.<ref name=Myths/>{{rp|394}} [[Sauron]], a lieutenant of Morgoth, was a powerful [[Maiar|Maia]] who used his abilities to manipulate objects and those beings enslaved to him. While with the [[One Ring]], Sauron's \"relatively smaller, power was ''concentrated''; Morgoth's vast power was ''disseminated''. The whole of 'Middle-earth' was Morgoth's Ring.\"<ref name=Myths/>{{rp|400}} In this imbuement of Middle-earth, \"Morgoth lost (or exchanged, or transmuted) the greater part of his original 'angelic' powers, of mind and spirit, while gaining a terrible grip upon the physical world.\"<ref name=Myths/>{{rp|400}}\n\nFor both Morgoth and Sauron, these acts of corruption, of putting their will and power into other things and people, weakened them considerably. \"Evil is fissiparous. But itself barren.\"<ref name=Myths/>{{rp|405}} With each creation or corruption, they were lessened because parts of their power now existed outside of themselves. Such power was not an unlimited supply, and even the [[Ainur]] who resided in [[Aman]] had limits. For example, [[Yavanna]] could not remake the light of the [[Two Trees of Valinor]] following their destruction by [[Ungoliant]]. The only hope for them to be restored would be to reclaim the light captured of them in the [[Silmarils]].<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref>\n\nSome Maiar, like Sauron, had power nearly the equal of a Vala<ref name=\"Ainu\"/> so that even [[Gandalf|Olórin]] feared him.<ref name=\"Istari\"/>{{rp|393}} Whatever lore Sauron shared with the [[Elves]], such as the making of the [[Rings of Power]] in [[Eregion]], would have unlocked their understanding of how to craft the rings using their own innate abilities. This is how the master-smith [[Celebrimbor]] was able to create the [[Three Rings]] in secret. But the rings that [[Sauron|Annatar]] had a hand in crafting were corrupted and bound to his own power, and any power that his slaves or servants had was also sourced in him. Servants like the [[Black Númenóreans]] and the Men who became [[Nazgûl]] used this power as sorcery. For example, if [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s heart had been pierced with the Morgul-knife, he would have been a wraith and under the Ringwraiths' command, just as they are under Sauron's.<ref name=\"Many\">{{FR|Meetings}}</ref>\n[[File:Donato Giancola - The Balance of Things.jpg‎|right|thumb|''The Balance of Things'' by [[Donato Giancola]] featuring the five Wizards]]\n\nThe [[Istari]], the Maiar who came to [[Middle-earth]] in the diminished form of men, were tasked to help guide the [[Free peoples]] against Sauron. The true nature of the Istari was not known to all, and they were simply considered wise old men. They were called [[Wizards]], and in Tolkien's mythology, this term is specifically only used for the Order of the Istari, who are of angelic origin. The word \"wizard\" is a translation of the [[Quenya]] ''istar'' (Sindarin ''ithron''); one of the members of an 'order' (as they called it), claiming to posses, and exhibiting, eminent knowledge of the history and nature of the World.\"<ref name =\"Istari\">{{UT|Istari}}</ref>\n\nA member of the race of Men wielding apparent magical powers would be referred to as a sorcerer, whether for good or evil. Although later contradicted, according to Tolkien's [[Letter 155]], the concept of magic in his world is not derived from lore or spells, and Men did not have any affinity for magic.<ref name=\"L155\"/> By this definition, lore like knowing the language of an animal would not be considered magical in [[Middle-earth]], merely knowledgeable.<ref>{{H|Fire}}</ref>{{rp|227–8}}\n\n===Elven magic===\nThe [[Eldar]] of [[Aman]] lived alongside the [[Ainur]], knew of their powers, and were even tutored by them. At the same time, the Elves did not comprehend the concept of magic as it was used by mortal beings. For Elves, their bodies and spirits worked in harmony and creation came naturally to them. The Elvish \"''[[fëa]]'' was above all designed to create things in co-operation with the ''hröa''.\"<ref>{{MR|P4g}}</ref>{{rp|332}} The Elves were taught arts and crafts by the [[Valar]] in [[Valinor]] and put dedication and love in everything they wrought. They were deeply connected to the things they made, and \"the love of the Elves for their land and their works is deeper than the deeps of the Sea.\"<ref name=\"Mirror\"/> Due to their near immortality,<ref name=\"Laws\">{{MR|Laws}}</ref>{{rp|212}} Elves could reach high levels of mastery in arts, crafts, and lore.\n\nThe [[Rings of Power]] and [[lesser rings]] were objects that would seem magical to the [[Secondborn]]; they gave powers of manipulation to the bearer of the [[One Ring]], and some might give the wearer invisibility, which was actually the ability to walk in the Unseen world. Galadriel was tutored by Melian when she resided in Doriath,<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref> and with her ring [[Nenya]], she was able to enchant and protect the [[Lothlórien|Golden Wood]].<ref name=\"Mirror\"/> Elrond wore the ring [[Vilya]] which helped him protect his hidden realm of [[Imladris]]. In the Third Age, [[Thranduil]] was the only Elf-lord who did not have a Great Ring to help him maintain his realm against the Enemy. However, he did have the [[Enchanted River]],<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref> which made people fall asleep and dream deeply, and the [[Elvenking's Halls]] as his fortress to help protect his people.<ref>{{H|Flies}}</ref> \n\nOther Elven artefacts were the ''[[Palantíri]]'',<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> the [[Fëanorian lamps|Lamps of the Noldor]],<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>{{rp|Note 2}} and the [[Mirror of Galadriel]],<ref name=\"Mirror\">{{FR|Mirror}}</ref> all of which would seem magical to outsiders. Even simpler artefacts, such as the river-boats of the [[Galadhrim]] and the elven ropes seemed to have wills of their own. \n[[Image:Šárka Škorpíková - Finrod vs Sauron.jpg|left|thumb|225px|''Finrod versus Sauron'' by [[:Category:Images by Šárka Škorpíková|Šárka Škorpíková]]]]\n\nIn addition to creation and craftsmanship, Elves had great skill with healing and medicine. Though such things came naturally to them, those Elves who healed often chose not to fight, except at great need, in order to preserve their skill, \"for the Eldar deemed that the dealing of death  . . . diminished the power of healing.\"<ref name=\"Laws\"/>{{rp|213}} While ordinary for an Elf, it might have felt magical to someone healed by them who did not understand how they were using their [[fëa]] (spirit). [[Glorfindel]] helped heal [[Frodo]] without seeming to do more than search the wound with his fingers. \"Frodo felt the chill lessen in his side and arm; a little warmth crept down from his shoulder to his hand, and the pain grew easier.\" There were no magic words or chants, and no medicine was applied at that time. He also gave Frodo and his companions a drink of clear liquid, which had no taste, that renewed their strength and vigour.<ref name=\"Flight\">{{FR|Flight}}</ref>\n\nElven minstrels, like [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] and [[Lúthien]], also exercised power through their songs. Finrod fought against Sauron in song and made great progress, but he was overpowered with a dire chant. Lúthien, who was half-[[Maia]], was able to use strong enchantments to disguise both herself and Beren, and she mesmerized Morgoth with her singing and dancing.<ref name=\"Beren\">{{S|Beren}}</ref>\n\n===Dark magic===\n[[Image:John_Howe_-_Black_Rider_02.jpg‎|right|thumb|''The Black Rider'' by [[John Howe]]]]\nSindarin has two words for dark magic; ''[[morgul]]'' and ''[[guldur]]''. The element ''gûl'' literally means \"magic lore\" or \"long study\" and has negative connotations that include \"necromancy\" and \"sorcery\". ''Môr'' translates to \"dark\" or \"night\", and ''dûr'' means \"dark\" or \"sombre\".<ref group=\"note\">Sindarin translations found at: [http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/online/sindar/dict-sd-en.html Hiswelókë's Sindarin dictionary]</ref> On their own these words are innocuous, as the concept of magic itself is neutral in Middle-earth.<ref name=\"L155\"/> However, when these terms are used in ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', such as referring to [[Dol Guldur]] or a Morgul-knife, they have negative connotations.<ref name=\"Many\"/> Morgul may refer to the dark lore and objects produced or influenced through the magic of Sauron and used for evil. These could be shared with his followers, such as the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]] and [[Black Númenóreans]]. \n\nThe magic wielded by Sauron, or other sorcerers who were taught how to manipulate the corruption Morgoth left in Arda, was based directly upon the physical legacy of Morgoth himself. The \"Morgoth-element in matter . . . was a prerequisite for such 'magic' and other evils as Sauron practised with it and upon it.\"<ref name=Myths>{{MR|P5VII}}</ref>{{rp|400}}\n\nSauron himself was also known as the Necromancer, which indicated that he had power over spirits.<ref>{{H|Stage}}</ref> The [[Witch-king|Witch-king of Angmar]], a servant of Sauron who wore a Ring of Power, had the ability to summon the [[Barrow-wights]] to the [[Barrow-downs]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>\n\n===Dwarven magic===\n[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Doors of Durin.jpg|left|thumb|150px|''The Doors of Durin'' by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] (as printed in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', Book II, Ch. 4 - [[A Journey in the Dark]]).]]\nCertain constructions of the [[Dwarves]] had properties which might be seen as magical. As a prominent example, [[Doors of Durin]] could open by themselves upon the entrant saying the word ''mellon'', without any visible machinery or other assistance. Such a magical appearance could be down to the ingenuity of Dwarven technology and craftsmanship. The Elven Door was created by the Dwarven craftsman [[Narvi]] and inscribed by the Elf-lord [[Celebrimbor]] with letters and signs fashioned in [[ithildin]].<ref name=\"FR|Journey\">{{FR|Journey}}</ref>\n\nAnother Dwarven door, seen in ''[[The Hobbit]]'', is the [[Back Door]] of the Lonely Mountain. This was a hidden, seamless door with a keyhole that would only be revealed on [[Durin's Day]]. The key lines that may infer an enchantment on the door are:\n\n{{blockquote|A gleam of light came straight through the opening into the bay and fell on the smooth rock-face. The old thrush . . . gave a sudden trill. There was a loud crack. A flake of rock split from the wall and fell. A hole appeared suddenly about three feet from the ground.|{{H|Doorstep}}}}\n\nThis appears to be what Tolkien might refer to as ''magia'', or physical magic, because there is a crack and a flake of rock falls off the wall.<ref name=\"L155\"/>\n\n==Tolkien's views==\nJ.R.R. Tolkien discussed the operations and moral dimensions of magic in [[Letter 155]] of ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]''. This letter is actually an unsent part of a draft of [[Letter 154]] which was dated September 25, 1954.\n\nMagic in Middle-earth was explained as an innate ability set of the Ainur and the Firstborn, to the exclusion of other peoples. Regardless, ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' both contain descriptions of special items and weapons that are said to have been crafted by Men and Dwarves, such as the dagger wielded by Merry which stabbed the Witch-king and [[Angrist]].<ref name=Beren/><ref name=\"Battle\">{{RK|Battle}}</ref> \n\nThe area of discussion in the letter is the difference between ''magia'' and ''goeteia'', with ''magia'' (physical magic) usually noted as good and ''goeteia'' (charm and conjuring magic) as bad. He wrote, \"neither is, in this tale, good or bad (per se), but only by motive or purpose or use. Both sides use both, but with different motives.\"<ref name=\"L155\"/> The evil motive was to use it to dominate free will. The Enemy used his ''magia'' to \"bulldoze\" both people and things and used his ''goeteia'' to terrify and subjugate. The Elves and Gandalf sparingly used ''magia'' for specific beneficial purposes (like burning pine cones to toss at the Wargs<ref>{{H|6}}</ref>), and their ''goetic'' effects were \"entirely ''artistic'' and not intended to deceive: they never deceive Elves (but may deceive or bewilder unaware Men).\"<ref name=\"L155\"/> For Elves, the difference was as clear to them as the difference to us between art (fiction, painting, and sculpture) and life.<ref name=\"L155\"/>\n\nAt the end of the draft noted as Letter 155, he wrote \"a difference between the use of 'magic' in this story [''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''] is that it is not to be come by 'lore' or spells; but it is an inherent power not possessed or attainable by Men as such.\"<ref name=\"L155\"/> While \"Aragorn's 'healing' might be regarded as 'magical', or at least a blend of magic and pharmacy and 'hypnotic' processes . . . A. is not a pure 'Man', but at long remove one of the 'children of Lúthien'.\"<ref name=\"L155\"/> However, in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' at the [[Doors of Durin]], Gandalf said, \"I once knew every spell in all the tongues of Elves or Men or Orcs, that was ever used for such a purpose. I can still remember ten score of them without searching in my mind.\"<ref name=\"FR|Journey\"/>\n\n'''The Númenórean Question''': Since this 1954 letter draft was unsent, he seemed undecided on the total exclusion of Men from spellcasting. Since Men did not have the natural skill to weave their own spirit into things or ideas, they may have used spells. Alongside the final paragraph of Letter 155, which ended with the explanation that Aragorn was distantly of Lúthien's line, Tolkien wrote this question: \"'But the Númenóreans used \"spells\" in making swords?'\"<ref name=\"L155\"/>{{rp|Note 2}}\n\nIn a later work completed by 1959, the ''[[Athrabeth Finrod ah Andreth]]'', there is an amended note which contains the [[Tale of Adanel]] in which the strongest and the cruellest of the fallen Men who worshipped Morgoth, during the dawn of Men in Middle-earth, were given \"gifts\" and \"knowledge that they kept secret\" which made them \"powerful and proud,\" and with their new power, they enslaved the other Men.<ref name=Athrabeth>{{MR|P4i}}</ref>{{rp|348}} In this later text, Men could be given artefacts or taught lore, but magic remained a noninherent trait.\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn the early stages of the [[legendarium]], the magical elements are more explicit. \n\nIn ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', the complex relationship of creation from the spirits and bodies of Ainur and Elves is explained as spells and enchantments.
