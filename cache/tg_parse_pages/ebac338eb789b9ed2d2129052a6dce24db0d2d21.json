Merry and Pippin had composed it for the occasion, modeling it and setting it to the same tune as the [[Far over the misty mountains cold|dwarf-song]] that [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] had heard in [[Bag End]] at the start of his adventure.  After it was sung Frodo praised the song and took the line \"We must away ere break of day\" literally, to Pippin's dismay.<ref>{{FR|I5}}</ref>\n\n==Text==\n[[File:J.R.R.
