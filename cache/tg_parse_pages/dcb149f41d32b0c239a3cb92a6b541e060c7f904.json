[[Arwen]] is shown lying in [[Rivendell]]. The scene then returns to Aragorn, who is unconscious. Arwen fades into view above Aragorn and, as she gently kisses him, saying \"May the grace of the [[Valar]] protect you\", Aragorn opens his eyes. \n\n[[Brego (horse)|Brego]] finds Aragorn lying unconscious on the riverbank. The horse nudges him and he wearily grips a part of Brego's mane, pulling himself up. Brego rides away with him, taking him towards [[Helm's Deep]]. \n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers scenes|37]]"}}}
