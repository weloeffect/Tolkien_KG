Their figures were formed of three bodies with heads with the faces of vultures with eyes of black stone. One head looked outward, one head looked inward and the third head stared across the gateway itself. They were inhabited by \"some [[Spirits|dreadful spirit]] of evil vigilance\". Not a [[Seen|visible]] or [[Unseen|invisible]] creature was unnoticed by them. They had the power to identify enemies and to block them from entering or from exiting through the gate with the force of their will alone, and were able to send up a shrill alarm call if their guard was breached.<ref name=Tower>{{RK|Tower}}</ref>{{rp|902}}\n\n==History==\nIt is possible that the Two Watchers were not created by the Men of Gondor, because a \"dreadful spirit of evil vigilance\" existed in them, they perceived a [[Hobbit]] as an enemy and made a high shrill cry when he passed them, but let [[Orcs]] pass the gateway without making such a cry.<ref group=note>Mark Fisher suggests in his [[Encyclopedia of Arda]] that the Two Watchers were \"surely not the work of the Gondorians\" while [[Michael Martinez]] suggests in his Middle-earth blog that they were \"apparently made by the Númenóreans of Gondor\", because he seems to infer from the text that the Orcs believe that the Men of Gondor (Tarks) made the Watchers. However, the confinement of malevolent spirits to these statues seems to be an unnatural action for Númenóreans (especially the [[Faithful]]) to him.</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=Mark Fisher|articleurl=https://www.glyphweb.com/arda/t/twowatchers.php|articlename=Two Watchers|website=The Encyclopedia of Arda|accessed=17 May 2022}}</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=Michael Martinez|articleurl=https://middle-earth.xenite.org/what-are-the-silent-watchers-of-mordor/|articlename=What Are the Silent Watchers of Mordor?|website=middle-earth.xenite.org|accessed=17 May 2022}}, has a different opinion</ref>\n\nOn [[14 March]] {{TA|3019}},<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry 14 March 3019, p. 1093</ref> the Two Watchers blocked [[Sam]]'s initial attempt to pass through the gate. However, Sam was able to overcome the will of the Two Watchers with the help of the [[Phial of Galadriel]] and was able to pass through the gate into the court of the Tower of Cirith Ungol in a second attempt. When he passed the gate, the Two Watchers uttered a high shrill cry, which was answered by a single clang of a bell high up in The Tower of Cirith Ungol.<ref name=Tower/>{{rp|902–903}} After hearing the bell the orc [[Snaga (orc of Mordor)|Snaga]] said to the orc [[Shagrat]] that a great fighter, an Elf or a Man of Gondor (\"[[tark]]\") got past the Watchers, and that's ''tark'''s work.<ref name=Tower/>{{rp|906}} It is probable that he meant that the feat of getting past the Watchers was the work of a Man of Gondor.<ref name=Kirith>{{SD|Kirith}}</ref>{{rp|26}}\n\nLater that day, in order to leave the Tower, Frodo and Sam held up again the Phial while invoking [[Eärendil]] and [[Elbereth]], which broke the will of the Two Watchers so that they were able to pass through the gate to the outside. The keystone of the arch and the wall above the gate crumbled into ruin after they passed, but the Two Watchers uttered a high and dreadful wail.<ref name=Tower/>{{rp|915}}\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n[[Christopher Tolkien]] treats it like a fact that \"that's tark's work\" refers to \"the getting past the Watchers\". Earlier manuscripts of what would later become the chapter The Tower of Cirith Ungol have the orc saying \"that's Elvish work\" or \"that's wizard's work\" and the latter has him assuming that the great fighter may be \"one of these filthy wizards\".<ref name=Kirith/>{{rp|26}}\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===The Two Watchers in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Return of the King (1980 film) - Two Watchers.jpg|''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]''\nFile:James A.
