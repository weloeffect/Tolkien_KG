Go back to the Shadow!|[[Gandalf]], ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', \"[[The Bridge of Khazad-dûm]]\"}}\n'''Utumno''', or '''Udûn''', was a fortress of [[Melkor]] in the far north of [[Middle-earth]]. It was the first and greatest of Melkor's citadels, delved in the earliest days. It was the home to hosts of demons, the fallen [[Ainur]] who allied with Melkor, and numerous monsters of corruption that were made in mockery of Middle-earth's naturally intended creatures and beings.<ref name=\"Captivity\">{{S|Captivity}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nUtumno was built by Melkor after his first arrival in [[Arda]]. The [[Valar]] had by this time created the [[Two Lamps]]. Utumno was built under the [[Iron Mountains]], where the light of [[Illuin]] and [[Ormal]] was dim and cold. Though the Valar did not yet know it, from this place, \"the blight of his [Melkor's] hatred flowed out thence, and the Spring of Arda was marred.\"<ref name=\"Beginning\">{{S|Beginning}}</ref> Utumno was delved exceedingly deep, with pits filled with fires and great hosts of servants, caverns and vaults \"hidden with deceit\". As a result the lands of the far north were made desolate, and remained so in the following ages.<ref name=\"Captivity\"/>\n\nMelkor used Utumno as his base of operations from {{VY|3400}} until {{YT|1090}}, when the Valar assailed Melkor's fortress.<ref name=\"P2a\">{{MR|P2a}}</ref>{{rp|53}}<ref name=\"P2e\">{{MR|P2e}}</ref>{{rp|74–5}} From there he had destroyed the [[Two Lamps]], so that the [[Valar|Powers]] left [[Almaren]], their dwelling-place in [[Middle-earth]], and removed into the West. He then began his corruption of Arda.<ref name=\"Beginning\"/> Utumno was also where the first captured [[Elves]] were taken and the creation of [[Orcs]] began as a mockery of the [[Firstborn]].\n\nUtumno was laid waste in {{YT|1099}}, in [[Battle of the Powers|the war]] that the Valar waged against Melkor for the sake of the Elves. The [[Valar]] attacked in full force, and until they broke the gates and unroofed it; Melkor hid in the uttermost pit, but they carried him to [[Valinor]] as their captive . Melkor was [[Chaining of Melkor|chained]] held as a prisoner.<ref name=\"Captivity\"/>\n\nMelkor had established a second and lesser fortress at the western end of the [[Iron Mountains|Ered Engrin]] to act as the first line of defence for Utumno from Aman.<ref name=\"Captivity\"/> This became [[Angband]], which was at first held by [[Sauron]]. After the destruction of Utumno, Melkor chose to rebuild and fortify Angband as his lair.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Utumno'', contains the stem ''Utumnu-''. An older version of the name, ''Utumna'', is said to derive from ''Tumna'' ([[Quenya]], \"low-lying, low, profound, deep\").<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, pp. 269, 271</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[Annals of Aman]]'', Tolkien wrote: \"Utupnŭ √TUP cover over; hide\" and \"that stronghold was ever after called Utumno the Deep-hidden\";<ref name=\"P2a\"/> while in ''[[The Etymologies]]'', the [[root]] is TUB and the original form of the name is given as ''Utubnu''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 394, entry \"TUB\"</ref>\n\n'''''Udûn''''' was the less commonly used [[Sindarin]] name of Utumno. It meant \"dark pit, Underworld\"<ref>{{HM|UI}}, p. 297</ref> or \"hell\".<ref>{{HM|LRI}}</ref> In ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', this name appears just once, in [[Gandalf]]'s words to [[Durin's Bane]].<ref>{{FR|Bridge}}</ref>\n\nIt survived, though, as a name for [[Udûn (valley)|the northern valley]] of [[Mordor]] that lay behind the [[Morannon]]. Undoubtedly, [[Sauron]] chose this name in memory of his ancient master's greatest stronghold.\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] was not entirely consistent with the location of Utumno, but it was always located within the northern Middle-earth, in or behind the Iron Mountains.\n\nAs noted from one of Tolkien's earlier sketch maps about Utumno from the ''[[Ambarkanta]]'', Utumno was previously spelled as ''Utumna'' and was north of the [[Iron Mountains]], towards the western end of the mountain chain.<ref>{{SM|4}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n{{title}}\n[[Category:Beleriand]]\n[[Category:Evil realms]]\n[[Category:Fortresses]]\n[[Category:Quenya locations]]\n[[de:Utumno]]\n[[fi:Utumno]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/villes tours et forteresses/utumno]]"}}}
