They appeared again the [[1933|next year]] around [[21 November]] to help deal with another goblin attack. In the battle that followed, many Red Elves got hurt. In [[1934]], the Red Elves were invited to a special [[wikipedia:Boxing Day|Boxing Day]] party. About a week before the next Christmas, the Red Elves enjoyed their time shoveling out Father Christmas' house. That year, they received magic sparkler spears to scare goblins away. During [[1936]], many Red Elves moved to [[Cliff House]].\n{{WLFC}}\n[[Category:Letters from Father Christmas]]"}}}
