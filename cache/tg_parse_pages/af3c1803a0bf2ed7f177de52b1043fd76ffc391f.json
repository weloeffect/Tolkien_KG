However they were harassed and captured by spies of the [[Morgoth|Enemy]] who took them to [[Utumno]] to the North. They were already scared when [[Oromë]] riding [[Nahar]] found them in awe.\n\n==1105 YT==\n[[Image:1105.png|700px]]\nAfter the Valar made a [[Battle of the Powers|Battle]] on the Enemy and destroyed his fortress, so that the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] live in safety an comfort, Orome took three ambassadors to [[Valinor]], [[Ingwë]], [[Finwë]] and [[Elwë]]. When they returned, they invited the other Elves.\n\nThen befell the first [[sundering of the Elves]]. The Minyar and most of the Tatyar were swayed by Orome and decided to follow him. The kindreds of [[Morwë]] and [[Nurwë]] were [[Avari|Unwilling]] and refused the summons, preferring the starlight and the wide spaces of the Earth to the rumour of the Valar.\n\nThe [[Eldar]] begun the [[Great March]] in three hosts. The Minyar were always the most eager for the road. Next the Tatyar, a greater host and then the Nelyar, the least eager, with two lords: Elwë and his brother [[Olwë]].\n\nAs they passed by the Sea of Helcar westwards, they saw great clouds hung still black in the North above the ruins of war. Many of them were scared and turned back.\n\n==1115 YT==\n[[Image:1115.png|700px]]\nThe journey went slow for the Eldar since Orome frequently departed and then returned to continue the journey. The Eldar were both amazed and tarrying for the nature, and also afraid. Not before after ten Valian years (or a century of [[coranar]]i) passed, they traversed [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]] and reached the Great River that would be called [[Anduin]], before the [[Misty Mountains]]. \n\nWhen the first two folk already passed the mountains, the Teleri were still by its eastern banks. Terrified by the tall and dangerous peaks, some of the folk of Olwe refused to continue and stayed there. Their leader was [[Lenwë|Dân]] and they became known as [[Nandor]].\n\n==1125 YT==\n[[Image:1125.png|700px]]\nThe journey continued in greater pace since by another 10 years, while the Teleri must still have been in [[Eriador]], the Vanyar and Noldor came at length over the [[Blue Mountains]] and entered [[Beleriand]]. The foremost companies passed over the [[Vales of Sirion]] and came to the shores of the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] but still, some Eldar were terrified and withdrew into the woods.\n\nThat year Oromë returned to Valinor to seek the counsel of Manwë and left the Eldar alone.\n\n==1128 YT==\n[[Image:1129.png|700px]]\nBy that time, the Teleri came at last to Beleriand and dwelt in the eastward region beyond the River [[Gelion]].\n\nIt's possible that by that time, [[Denethor (Nando)|Denethor]] and some of the Nandor decide to continue the journey after all, and head for the West.\n\n==1132 YT==\n[[Image:1132.png|700px]]\n[[Ulmo]] comes and using an island as a ship, takes the Vanyar and the Noldor on it to Valinor, while the Teleri still linger. Some of them were looking for Elwe, who fell in a trance after seeing [[Melian]]. \n\nOlwe takes those eager to continue the journey and stay near the sea waiting for Ulmo. In the meantime they are befriended by [[Osse]] and [[Uinen]] and start to love the sea.\n\n==1149 YT==\n[[Image:1149.png|200px]]\n==1150 YT==\n[[Image:1150.png|200px]]\n==1200 YT==\n[[Image:1200.png|200px]]\n==1300 YT==\n[[Image:1300.png|200px]]\n==1350 YT==\n[[Image:1350.png|200px]]\n==1498 YT==\n[[Image:1498.png|200px]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Historical Atlas/Second Age]]\n*[[Historical Atlas/Third Age]]\n\n[[Category:Chronology]]\n[[Category:Historical atlases]]"}}}
