It is stated that [[Isildur]] began an grand plan to seal off Mordor and that the construction began before the end of {{TA|1}} and was completed during the reign of [[Rómendacil I]] ({{TA|492}} - {{TA|541}}). It is mentioned that by {{TA|1640}} the last citadel guarding Mordor was abandoned by Gondor, so Sauron sent all [[Ringwraiths]] - except the [[Witch-king]] and [[Khamûl]] - to lake [[Núrnen]] with the mission to ready Mordor for his return. Thereafter, the Ringwraith Dwar of Waw occupied the Black Gate with Orcs, Trolls and mannish servants. After Sauron's fall, only the Black Gate and the upper levels of the Towers of the Teeth were destroyed.\n\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Towers of the Teeth.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Towers of the Teeth in ''The Lord of the Rings Online'' (Narchost in the foreground)]]\n'''[[2017]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Both Narchost and Carchost are infiltrated by the player with the help of the Rangers shortly before the Battle of the Black Gate.
