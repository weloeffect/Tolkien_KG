Breaking box office records worldwide, capturing numerous Academy Awards, the trilogy is a breathtaking cinematic achievement and beloved by fans everywhere.For Sean Astin, the call from his agent about the role of Samwise Gamgee couldn't have come at a better time. His career was at a low point and choice roles were hard to come by. But his 18-month experience in New Zealand with director Peter Jackson and the cast and crew of The Lord of the Rings films would be more than simply a dream-come-true--it would prove to be the challenge of a lifetime.Though much has been written about the making of the films, the real story of what took place on the set, the harrowing ordeals of the actors and the unspoken controversy and backstage dealings have never been told. More than a companion guide to the Rings films, There and Back Again is filled with stories from the set and of the actors involved that have never before been revealed--an eye-opening look at the blood, sweat, and tears that went into the making of one of the most ambitious films of all time.}}\n\n\n{{lordoftheringsfilms}}\n\n{{title|italic}}\n\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings (film series) tie-in books]]\n\n[[fi:There and Back Again : An Actor's Tale]]"}}}
