The Rockfoot Pass was invented for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'' by [[Amazon Studios]].\n\n== History ==\nIn the late [[Second Age]], the Rockfoot Pass was a location that a certain [[Harfoots|Harfoot community]] passed by when migrating from one seasonal haven to the next, particularly from the [[Norfield Glen]] to the [[Grove]].\n\nDuring one such migration, the normal migration trail through the Rockfoot Pass became impassable, causing the main caravan of the Harfoot community to attempt to take an alternative route through a [[Wolves|wolf-infested]] eerie forest. The Brandyfoot family, [[Poppy Proudfellow]], and [[The Stranger]] follow in haste behind them. During this time, [[Dilly Brandyfoot]] stated her dislike of the eerie forest and Poppy Proudfellow pondered on what madness drove the main caravan there. To this, [[Elanor Brandyfoot]] suggested that the Rockfoot Pass must have been blocked in. The discussion was then halted by [[Marigold Brandyfoot]], who reasoned that pulling the carts would not get any easier that night. The Stranger them mimicked her words, saying \"''Easier in the dark''\".\n\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) locations]]"}}}
