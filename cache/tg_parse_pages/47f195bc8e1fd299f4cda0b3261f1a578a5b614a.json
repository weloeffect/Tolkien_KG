Legend said that the island had been placed there by [[Uinen]] herself, the [[Lady of the Seas]], who was held in particular reverence by the mariners of Númenor. Indeed, the [[Guild of Venturers]] called themselves ''[[Uinendili]]'' - devotees of Uinen - and often moored their great ship [[Eämbar]] off Tol Uinen. Their [[Great Captain]], [[Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion]], raised a tower on the island named [[Calmindon]], to shine a light across the waters of the bay of Rómenna.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}</ref>\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Islands]]\n[[Category:Quenya locations]]\n[[de:Tol Uinen]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/eaux/iles/tol uinen]]\n[[fi:Tol Uinen]]"}}}
