A sequel to the 2014 game ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]'', ''Shadow of War'' was released on 10 October 2017<ref>{{webcite|author=Tom Phillips|articlename=Middle-earth: Shadow of War release date delayed|dated=1 June 2017|website=Eurogamer.net|articleurl=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-06-01-middle-earth-shadow-of-war-release-date-delayed|accessed=2 June 2017}}</ref> for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows. Set between the events of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the game follows the continuing adventures of [[Gondorian]] Ranger [[Talion]] and the Elf-wraith [[Celebrimbor]] in their campaign against [[Sauron]].<ref>{{webcite|author=James Orry|articlename=Middle-earth: Shadow of War confirmed for Project Scorpio|dated=28 February 2017|website=Video Gamer|articleurl=http://www.videogamer.com/news/middle-earth-shadow-of-war-confirmed-for-project-scorpio|accessed=3 May 2017}}</ref> \n\n==Plot==\nThe player continues the story of the ranger Talion and the spirit of the [[Elf]] lord [[Celebrimbor]], who shares Talion's body, as they forge a new [[Ring of Power]] to amass an army to fight against [[Sauron]]. At the beginning of the story, Celebrimbor is captured by [[Shelob]], the spider of [[Cirith Ungol]]. Talion seeks him out and eventually tracks the Bright Lord. Shelob turns into a human form and forces Talion to trade the Ring for Celebrimbor. The gravewalker travels to [[Minas Ithil]] to retrieve the [[palantír]], but sees the fortress being attacked. He kills an [[orc]] captain with the help of Idril, Lord Castamir's daughter. Celebrimbor advises Talion against staying with the Gondorians, but the gravewalker refuses to leave his kin. When the [[Witch-King]] and the [[Nazgûl]] come to raid Minas Ithil, Talion stays to help. The city is eventually lost through Lord Castamir's betrayal, and Talion attempts to retrieve the palantír with no success. Before being corrupted by the Witch-King Talion is rescued by Eltariel, an elf assassin connected to Lady [[Galadriel]] and sent to hinder Sauron's ascension. She wields some portion of Galadriel's own power of light and she can use it to disrupt the workings of Sauron and his creatures. She does not wholly trust Talion and his bond with Celebrimbor, but accepts them as an ally of convenience and preferable to Sauron. Talion and Eltariel flee as the Witch-King settles into his new seat of power—the newly christened [[Minas Morgul]].\n\nEventually, Sauron learns that Shelob is plotting treachery against him and sends Nazgûl to kill her. Talion and Eltariel fight them back, but Shelob is exhausted and weakened, and surrenders the New Ring to Talion. With the power of the Ring, Talion and Eltariel are able to lay claim to [[Mordor]]. \n\nElsewhere, he arrives at [[Nurn]]. He dominates a champion [[Olog]]—an orc-troll hybrid of sorts—named Bruz and begins gathering the troops and resources needed to lay siege to and thereby claim some of Sauron's fortresses. After a successful siege Talion and Bruz confront to overlord who turns out to be [[Ratbag]], the snivelling orc who'd been Talion's willing pawn in the first game, who is still alive. \n\nMeanwhile, the Nazgûl have become more active and are using some means to dominate and control orcs; Eltariel spies on the Nazgûl to attempt to understand their weaknesses and sometimes relays information to Talion. He and Celebrimbor have themselves been exploring the potential of their bond, finding more powers and applications. Talion's forces repeal an attempt by Sauron's orcs to capture the fortress, but Bruz—who had either faked his domination or overcome it—betrays and slays him in front of the entire army, claiming the fort and its forces for himself. Talion's unique status keeps him from truly dying, and he revives soon enough humiliated but thirsting for revenge. He gathers more forces, retakes the fortress, and after chasing Bruz throughout Mordor he finally runs the clever Bruz to the ground—using the power of domination to go further than simple control. Talion and Celebrimbor break Bruz's mind and leave him deranged. Ratbag is horrified at this fate, and deserts Talion.\n\nEltariel's investigations yield fruit, and Talion is able to find and confront some Ringwraiths directly; two are revealed to be kings of men tempted by Sauron ''and'' Celebrimbor, who aided Sauron—in his guise as Annatar—more willingly and for longer than he'd admitted to Talion. The third is shown to be Isildur, the king who'd defeated Sauron at the end of the Second Age, whose body was retrieved and given a ring by agents of Sauron, revived into undeath to make him serve Sauron as humiliation and punishment.\n\nTalion's army grows mightier and he and Eltariel lay siege to Barad-Dur to attempt to reach Sauron, doing well enough the Ringwraiths appear in desperation. Talion once again battles [[Isildur]], and bests him. He and Celebrimbor attempt to dominate the wraith, and this time succeed in breaking Sauron's control. Celebrimbor makes to enslave the Ringwraith to his service, but Talion realizes that Celebrimbor doesn't want to stop Sauron, the elf wants to replace him as the Bright Lord. He stabs the Ringwraith, destroying Isildur and laying him to rest. Celebrimbor rages at Talion, and the pair quarrel far more harshly than they ever have. Talion refuses to aid Celebrimbor in ruling the world, and Celebrimbor forsakes him for Eltariel—leaving Talion dying from the old wound of his cut throat—and takes the New Ring with him. The pair abandon Talion to die and go to confront Sauron on their own with the idea of dominating the Lord of Mordor to their combined will and the might of the New Ring. Talion receives a vision from Shelob, who advises him to take up Isildur's [[The One Ring|Ring]] and resist Sauron's domination as long as possible. Talion accepts, and begins gaining the powers of the Ringwraith. \n\nNow cursed but retaining his own will, Talion storms Minas Morgul, raising shades of the dead to fight beside him as he goes until he rolls over the city's orcish defenders. He confronts and bests the Witch-King but cannot destroy or dominate him, only force him to withdraw. He uses the Palantir in Minas Morgul to watch Celebrimbor and Eltariel battle Sauron and almost win. At the last moment Sauron pulls a trick from Isildur and cuts the New Ring from Eltariel's hand, weakening her and cutting Celebrimbor loose. Sauron seizes the elf-wraith and tries to subsume him. Eltariel flees with the New Ring.\n\nAll he can do is buy time, so Talion wages a decades-long campaign, leading a civil war in Mordor to continually disrupt Sauron's forces and prevent them from unifying. One day his will can longer hold out against the corrosion of the Ring and he accepts Sauron's control and the Witch-King's leadership—but his actions delayed Sauron from being able to multiply and strengthen his forces, and gave time for the One Ring to be found. Without his efforts the [[free peoples|free people]] of [[Middle-earth]] would have been utterly outmatched by Sauron's orc hordes. Eventually Talion dies with the other Ringwraiths at the destruction of the One Ring. Celebrimbor is released or perhaps diminished when Sauron's power is dispersed. In the next world Talion, free of his wraith corruption, walks through beautiful lands discarding his unneeded weapons as he goes to whatever comes next.\n\n== Voice cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!

According to the game, Sauron freely uses his elf-like guise of Annatar, though in the books he lost that form in the [[Downfall of Númenor|destruction of Númenor]], and the king of Rohan Helm, who according to the books he lived in the Third Age, is transplanted into the Second Age. Likewise, Celebrimbor is portrayed as an erstwhile ally of Sauron who travelled with him to recruit unknowing human lords to be Ringwraiths. It also reinterprets Shelob as a somewhat heroic character, using her gift of foresight to contribute to Sauron's downfall even at her own cost. She is depicted as a Maia (in addition to being Sauron's former lover) who takes the shape of a beautiful woman when she wishes. Nothing about all of that is ever seen or mentioned about her in any of Tolkien's books.\n\n==Reception==\n{{VG reviews\n| agg1=[http://www.metacritic.com Metacritic]\n| agg1score=81% <ref name=\"Metacritic\">[http://www.metacritic.com Metacritic], \"[https://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/middle-earth-shadow-of-war Middle-earth: Shadow of War] (accessed [[14 December|14]] [[December]] [[2022]])</ref>\n| rev1=[http://www.ign.com IGN]\n| rev1score=9 <ref name=\"IGN Review\" />\n| rev2=[https://egmnow.com/ Electronic Gaming Monthly]\n| rev2score=8 <ref name=\"Electronic Gaming Monthly Review\">[https://egmnow.com/ Electronic Gaming Monthly], \"[http://www.egmnow.com/articles/reviews/middle-earth-shadow-of-war-review/ Middle-earth: Shadow of War review]\", [[26 September|26]] September 2014 (accessed [[14 December|14]] [[December]] [[2022]]</ref>\n| rev3=[https://www.gameinformer.com/ Game Informer]\n| rev3score=9.5 <ref name=\"Game Informer Review\">[http://www.gameinformer.com/games/middle-earth_shadow_of_war/b/playstation4/archive/2017/10/05/game-informer-review-middle-earth-shadow-of-war.aspx Middle-earth: Shadow of War Review], [[6 October|6]] October 2017 (accessed 14 December 2022)</ref>\n| rev4=[https://www.gamespot.com/ GameSpot]\n| rev4score=7 <ref name=\"GameSpot Review\" /> \n| rev5=[https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/ PC Gamer (US)]\n| rev5score=73 <ref name=\"PC Gamer (US) Review\">[https://www.pcgamer.com/middle-earth-shadow-of-war-review/ MIDDLE-EARTH: SHADOW OF WAR REVIEW]\", [[30 October|30]] [[October]] 2017 (accessed [[14 December|14]] [[December]] [[2022]])</ref>\n| rev6=[https://www.polygon.com/ Polygon]\n| rev6score=7.5 <ref name=\"Polygon Review\">[https://www.polygon.com/2017/10/5/16428308/middle-earth-shadow-of-war-review Middle-earth: Shadow of War review]\", [[30 October|30]] [[October]] 2017 (accessed [[14 December|14]] [[December]] [[2022]])</ref>\n}}''Middle-earth: Shadow of War'' has received generally positive reviews, with reviewers praising the sound quality, accessibility, the game's core feature, and its Nemesis system, although less positive to [[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor|its predecessor]].
