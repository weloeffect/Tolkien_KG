Tolkien]] in [[Letter 213]]}}\n\nTolkien belonged to the '''Roman Catholic Church'''. Raised in the church by his mother [[Mabel Tolkien|Mabel]], he would remain a devout Catholic till his death. His faith was an essential part of his life, which formed an aspect of his writings.\n\n==Tolkien's life==\n===Mabel Tolkien===\nThe parents of John Ronald Reuel Tolkien were [[:Wikipedia:Anglicanism|Anglican]]. He was baptized four weeks after his birth, on [[31 January]] [[1892]] at the Anglican [[Bloemfontein]] Cathedral.<ref name=Bio>{{HM|Bio}}</ref>{{rp|13}}<ref group=note>In [[Letter to Nancy Smith (Christmas 1963)|an unpublished letter]], Tolkien dated his baptism on [[8 January]], but the correct date is 31 January, according to the baptismal records of the cathedral. Cf. {{CG|C}}, p. 776</ref> Some time after becoming widowed, [[Mabel Tolkien]] began to visit a Roman Catholic church: [[:Wikipedia:St Anne's Church, Birmingham|St Anne]]. After receiving formation there, in June [[1900]] she was received into the Catholic Church. Her conversion was not accepted by her family or the Tolkiens, who belonged to other Christian denominations, and Mabel lost the only help she had from her father and brother-in-law. Despite the pressure and the economic distress, she began to instruct her two sons in the new faith.<ref name=Bio />{{rp|23–24}} Looking for a better place of worship, Mabel felt attracted by the [[Birmingham Oratory]], where the family met Father [[Francis Morgan]]. This priest became a friend of the family, who would go on to support them. On [[Christmas]] of [[1903]], Tolkien received his First Communion.<ref name=Bio />{{rp|26–28}} \n\nDespite the help of Father Francis, their mother had to work very hard to raise her children and have them schooled. Finally she fell ill of diabetes and died in 1904. Tolkien himself wrote nine years later: \"''My own dear mother was a martyr indeed, and it is not to everybody that God grants so easy a way to his great gifts as he did to [[Hilary Tolkien|Hilary]] and myself, giving us a mother who killed herself with labour and trouble to ensure us keeping the faith.''\"<ref name=Bio />{{rp|31}} Even sixty years later, he would refer to his mother as an example to others,<ref>{{L|267}}, pp. 353-354</ref> showing that she would always be one of the pillars of his faith.\n\n===Father Francis===\nIn her will, Mabel appointed Father Francis as the guardian of her children, both because of her trust in him and to ensure their continued Catholic education.<ref name=Bio />{{rp|32}} The boys lived for four years with an aunt, but they spent most of the day in the Oratory, as it was nearby. They served Father Francis' early mass, and participated enthusiastically in the parish activities.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.birminghamoratory.org.uk/tolkien-and-the-oratory/|articlename=Tolkien and the Oratory|website=[http://www.birminghamoratory.org.uk/ The Oratory, Birmingham]|accessed=28 July 2020}}</ref>\n[[File:Birmingham Oratory.jpg|thumb|Birmingham Oratory as in 2009]]\nMorgan's guardianship was not only economical and spiritual, but also intellectual: the Catholic environment of the Oratory, motivated by the anti-modernist reform of [[:Wikipedia:Saint Pius X|Pope Pius X]] would have a great impact on Tolkien that can be seen later in his life.<ref>A.

Despite that strict situation, Tolkien observed the order with perfect obedience, and on [[8 January]] of [[1913]], he and Edith got engaged. The recovered relationship increased Tolkien's religious fervour, and began a diary entitled \"''JRRT and [[Edith Tolkien|EMB]] in account together, [[Wikipedia:Ad maiorem Dei gloriam|AMDG]]''\", in which he accounted, among other things, his performance of religious duties.<ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 36</ref> The only condition Tolkien asked of Edith was that she convert to Catholicism, which she accepted despite the inconvenience that it would bring her. They would marry on [[22 March]] [[1916]], with the blessing of Father Francis.<ref name=Bio />{{rp|78–79}}\n\n===The Inklings===\nWhen he returned to Oxford as a professor in [[1925]], he was an active lay man, both with the chaplaincy of the University and the Catholic communities of [[Oxford]].<ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] ([[2017]]), ''[[The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide]]'' (Revised and Expanded Edition): II. Reader's Guide, \"Religion\", pp. 1070-1072</ref>\n\nTolkien met [[C.S. Lewis]] while working at the Oxford University. They became close friends when Lewis was still an atheist, and religion was one of the main topics in their conversations. In [[1929]], Lewis was convinced with theism, although he could not accept Christianity, yet. In [[19 September]] [[1931]], Tolkien, Lewis and [[Hugo Dyson]] had a dinner, followed by a walk that ran till 4 a.m. There Lewis was moved by Tolkien's ideas that the truth inherent to all myths and its relation with the historical ''myth'' of Christ's Resurrection.<ref name=Bio />{{rp|146–148}} Lewis' conversion supported a new step in their friendship, although Tolkien always regretted that Lewis did not become a Roman Catholic: Lewis chose Anglicanism, which Tolkien considered a distortion of the previous Catholicism.<ref name=Bio />{{rp|151}} \n\nIn the following years, a literary club was formed around Lewis, called '[[The Inklings]]', which he describes as \"''a sort of informal club [...] the qualifications (as they have informally evolved) are a tendency to write, and Christianity''\".<ref>[[C.S. Lewis]], ''Collected Letters'', vol. 2 ([[2004]]), Letter to [[Charles Williams]], 11 March 1936, p. 183</ref> His secretary [[Walter Hooper]] will later compare it with the [[:Wikipedia:Oxford Movement|Oxford Movement]], an intellectual movement begun a century before, in which their members also shared their Christian passion for Truth with conversation and comradery.<ref>[[Walter Hooper]], \"[http://www.catholiceducation.org/en/culture/art/the-inklings-the-other-oxford-movement.html The Inklings: The Other Oxford Movement]\", first published in ''Catholic World Report'', June 1997. It was included in ''[[Tolkien: A Celebration]]'' (edited by [[Joseph Pearce]])</ref><ref group=note>It must be noticed that Father Francis was a personal disciple of [[:Wikipedia:John Henry Newman|John Henry Newman]], one of the founders of the Oxford Movement. Therefore, Tolkien was a direct heir of this movement, and this would have a great impact on the Inklings. Cf. [[José Manuel Ferrández Bru]], ''[[La Conexion Española de J.R.R. Tolkien|\"Uncle Curro\". J.R.R. Tolkien's Spanish Connection]]'', \"Tolkien and Cardinal Newman\"</ref>\n\nAfter Lewis's death, Tolkien once refused an invitation to write an obituary for him on religious grounds, stating that ''a Catholic could not possibly say anything sincere about Jack's books without giving widespread offence'' due to Lewis' bad understanding on denominational differences. However, he also imagined a reconciliation between Lewis and the Virgin Mary: ''According to my fashion and in a remote way this is an ingredient in the meeting of [[Gimli]] and [[Galadriel]]''.<ref>Unpublished [[Letter to George Sayer (28 November 1963)]]. Cf. quotes in [http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/tolkien-john-ronald-reuel-1892-1973-autograph-letter-3815315-details.aspx Christies' lot]</ref>\n\n===Spiritual life===\n[[File:Oxford Oratory.jpg|thumb|Mass at the Oxford Oratory Church of St Aloysius Gonzaga]]\nFor the many years Tolkien lived in Oxford, he had a routine life, in which he attended daily mass very early in the morning. He usually went with his children by bike to the 7:30am mass, served at [[:Wikipedia:Oxford Oratory|St Aloysius Catholic Church]].<ref name=Bio/>{{rp|115}} His wife Edith did not like at first that Tolkien took the children to church, as her view of Catholicism had declined over the years, even giving up attending mass. Sometimes the couple had tough discussions about this, which ended after a reconciliation in [[1940]], with Edith leaving any resentment towards religion and resuming interest in church affairs.<ref name=Bio/>{{rp|157}}\n\nHumphrey Carpenter describes Tolkien's religion as \"one of the deepest and strongest elements in his personality\", affecting him both with great joy and sadness. This led him to have a strict spiritual practice, being very scrupulous when attending communion, which he denied himself if he had not confession before.<ref name=Bio/>{{rp|128}} It is probable that this excessive scrupulousness was episodic, not something typical of his daily life as presented by Carpenter: Tolkien did explain he always liked to go to Confession before receiving Communion,<ref name=Sayer>[[George Sayer]], \"[http://dc.swosu.edu/mythlore/vol21/iss2/6/ Recollections of J.R.R. Tolkien]\", in ''[[Proceedings of the J.R.R. Tolkien Centenary Conference]]'', ed. Patricia Reynolds and Glen H. GoodKnight, pp. 23-24</ref> but attending daily mass would imply many occasions of missing Confession. No spiritual director would allow this behaviour and it would contradict the own importance Tolkien gave to [[:Wikipedia:Frequent Communion|Frequent Communion]]:\n\n{{blockquote|The only cure for sagging or fainting faith is Communion. Though always itself, perfect and complete and inviolate, the Blessed Sacrament does not operate completely and once for all in any of us. Like the act of Faith it must be continuous and grow by exercise. Seven times a week is more nourishing than seven times at intervals.|[[Letter 250]] (dated [[1 November]] [[1963]])}}\n\nIn any case, Tolkien did have a crisis of deep sadness, as he describes in one occasion in which was helped by [[Robert Havard|Humphrey Havard]], his personal doctor and fellow Catholic Inkling:\n\n{{blockquote|All right now, but I've been in a very bad state. Humphrey came here and told me that I must go to confession and that he would come early on Sunday morning to take me to confession and communion. That's the sort of doctor to have.<ref name=Sayer/>}}\n\n===Spiritual recommendations===\nIn his [[Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien|published letters]], Tolkien deals many times with religious topics, and gave some spiritual advice, especially to his sons. He told his son [[Michael Tolkien|Michael]] about the importance of the Eucharist:\n\n{{blockquote|Out of the darkness of my life, so much frustrated, I put before you the one great thing to love on earth: the Blessed Sacrament. [...] There you will find romance, glory, honour, fidelity, and the true way of all your loves on earth, and more than that: Death: by the divine paradox, that which ends life, and demands the surrender of all, and yet by the taste—or foretaste—of which alone can what you seek in your earthly relationships (love, faithfulness, joy) be maintained, or take on that complexion of reality, of eternal endurance, which every man’s heart desires.|[[Letter 43]] (dated [[6 March|6]]-[[8 March]] [[1941]])}}\n[[File:J.R.R.

The change of the Latin language with vernacular was rejected by Tolkien, both in theory and practice, as his grandson [[Simon Tolkien|Simon]] tells:\n\n{{blockquote|I vividly remember going to church with him in [[Bournemouth]]. He was a devout Roman Catholic and it was soon after the Church had changed the liturgy from Latin to English.

I found the whole experience quite excruciating, but My Grandfather was oblivious. He simply had to do what he believed to be right.|[[Simon Tolkien]], \"[http://www.simontolkien.com/mygrandfather My Grandfather]\" in ''The Mail On Sunday'', [[23 February]] [[2003]]}}\n\nHe did agree that the Church was a living organism that grew and changed with the ages, but precisely for that, the research for a simplified and primitive Christianity was a Protestant regression, \"''and primitiveness is no guarantee of value and is and was in great part a reflection of ignorance''\".<ref>{{L|306}}, pp. 393-394</ref> On the other hand, he frequently complained about how the translations of the new liturgy were inaccurate or in bad or clumsy English.<ref name=Sayer /> But language was not the only change that affected Tolkien; he was saddened more by the spiritual decay that came thereafter: the irreverence and immodesty within churches, as well as unprepared priests. The first time he noticed that people no longer made genuflections, he was so disappointed that he rose up and stomped out of the church.<ref>[[Bradley J.
