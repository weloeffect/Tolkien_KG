''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', \"Proto-Eldarin vowels\" by [[Christopher Gilson]]</ref>\n\nOne view says that it can be viewed as a compound: ''ed/et'' + ''sîr'' would trigger a lenition ''ed/et'' + ''hîr''. If preposition and stem are understood as different entities, t/h should be pronounced separately ({{IPA|[ˈethir]}}) (like English \"a''t-h''ome\").\n\nAnother view would be that PQ ''etsiri'' evolved as [[Old Sindarin]] *''ett<sup>h</sup>ire''<ref>[[Didier Willis]]' ''Sindarin Dictionary'' version of 2001; containing etymological reconstructions by [[David Salo]]</ref> before simplified as ''ethir''.
