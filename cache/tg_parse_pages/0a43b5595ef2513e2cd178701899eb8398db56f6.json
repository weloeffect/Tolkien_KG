During the battle Gamling was the first to realize that [[Orcs]] had penetrated [[Helm's Deep|the Deep]] through its culvert, and he led the counter-attack himself.\n\nGamling seems to have been brought up in the western valleys of Rohan; he understood the tongue of [[Dunland]] that was still spoken in those regions.<ref name=\"Helm\"/>\n\nWhen the [[Deeping Wall]] was taken, Gamling was one of those who retreated into the narrows. When the battle was over Gamling, [[Éomer]], [[Gimli]] and others came forth from the caves.<ref>{{TT|Road}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nGamling is an [[Old English]] name. It is derived from the stem ''gamol'', which means \"old\", but is only found in Old English in verse-language<ref name=\"N\">{{HM|N}}, entry '''Gamling (the Old)''', p. 758</ref>\n\nGamling is somewhat anglicized/modernized while genuinely it should be ''Gameling''. It would be one of the words and names that hobbits recognized as similar to [[Hobbitish]] (like ''[[Shadowfax]]'' or ''[[Gríma|Wormtongue]]'').<ref name=\"N\"/>\n\n==Inspiration==\nTolkien noted that it is the origin of the surnames Gamlen, Gam(b)lin. It appears in the medieval poem ''The Tale of Gamelin'' (inspiration of Shakespeare's ''[[Wikipedia:As You Like It|As You Like It]]'')<ref name=\"N\"/>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Gamling in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers - Gamling.jpg|Gamling in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Gamling.jpg|Gamling in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n\n'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''\n:[[Patrick Barr]] provided the voice of Gamling.\n\n'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''\n:Gamling was played by New Zealand actor [[Bruce Hopkins]]. His role was expanded to that of a lieutenant to [[Théoden]].\n\n'''2010: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest]]'':'''\n:Despite the game's heavy reliance on movie audio tracks, Gamling's speech at the departure from Edoras is not resampled, but dubbed in verbatim by [[Tom Kane]].\n\n'''2013: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Gamling's role is similar to that he has in the book. He welcomes [[Théoden]]'s host to [[Helm's Deep]], fights on the [[Helm's Dike]] and on the wall of the [[Hornburg]] and after the wall is blown retreats into the [[Glittering Caves]] along with [[Gimli]] and [[Éomer]]. Later, Gamling rides to [[Minas Tirith]] with Theoden's riders and survives the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:Rohirrim]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n\n[[de:Gamling]]\n[[fi:Gamling]]\n[[fr:/encyclo/personnages/hommes/3a/hommes_du_nord/rohirrim/gamelin]]"}}}
