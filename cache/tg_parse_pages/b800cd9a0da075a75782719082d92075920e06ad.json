Tolkien]] and first published within ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil|The Adventures of Tom Bombadil and Other Verses from the Red Book]]'' in 1962. It makes use of ''caesura'' in the manner of [[Anglo-Saxon]] poetry.<ref>{{AB|Comm}}</ref>\n\nThe tone of the poem is greed — an old elven hoard is taken by a dwarf, a dragon and a man. Each is consumed by the greed of owning the hoard until each in turn is killed and the next owner also becomes consumed by greed until he is killed in turn.<ref>{{AB|Hoard}}</ref> It is said to echo events of the [[First Age]], specifically the [[Elves|Elven]]/[[Númenorean]] tradition of [[Túrin]], [[Glaurung]] and [[Mîm]] in [[Nargothrond]], possibly derived from [[Rivendell]].<ref>{{AB|Preface}}</ref>\n\nTolkien mentions the poem in a letter to [[Pauline Baynes]] in 1961, commenting that: \"I suppose one would also have to except 'The Hoard' from being 'light-hearted', though the woes of the successive (nameless) inheritors are seen merely as pictures in a tapestry of antiquity and do not deeply engage individual pity. I was most interested by your choice of this as your favourite.\"<ref>{{L|235}}</ref>\n\nIn 1967, Tolkien recorded the poem for ''[[Poems and Songs of Middle Earth]]''.\n\nTolkien didn't agree with Baynes's original illustration for the poem, specifically the depiction of the man, and the sleeping dragon facing away from the entrance; he chose it to be omitted, as only five illustrations were to be printed, but eventually all six passed for publication. Baynes however revised the picture for the poem's reprint in ''[[Poems and Stories]]''.<ref>{{AB|Intro}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nThe original version of the poem was called '''''Iúmonna Gold Galdre Bewunden'''''.<ref>{{CG|RG}}, p. 383</ref> The [[Old English]] title of the poem is taken from a line of verse contained within ''[[Beowulf]]'', which in modern English reads: \"the gold of men of long ago enmeshed in enchantment\" (l. 3052).<ref>{{L|235}}</ref>\n\n''Iúmonna Gold Galdre Bewunden'' was originally published by Tolkien in three different versions. The first version was published in January [[1923]] within ''The Gryphon'' (n.s.4, no.4). A heavily revised version was then published in the ''Oxford Magazine'' 55, no.15 ([[4 March]] [[1937]]). The third version, differing little from the second but bearing the title ''The Hoard'', was published in ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil|The Adventures of Tom Bombadil and Other Verses from the Red Book]]'' in [[1962]].\n\nThe original 1923 version was reprinted in [[Douglas A. Anderson]]'s ''[[The Annotated Hobbit]]''. Both the 1923 and 1937 versions were reprinted in ''[[Beowulf and the Critics]]'' in 2002 along with one intermediate version.<ref>{{CG|RG}}, p. 383</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Index:Poems by J.R.R.
