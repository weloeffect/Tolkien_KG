Their fleets and even their [[Elenna|island]] home were into an abyss that opened between [[Númenor]] and the Blessed Realm.<ref name=Akallabeth/>\n\nMeanwhile, Ar-Pharazôn and his mortal warriors were buried beneath falling hills. Yet, they are said to lie imprisoned within the Caves of the Forgotten, awaiting the day of the [[Last Battle]] when they will be released from their caves.<ref name=Akallabeth/> However, the part that they have to play in the battle remains a mystery.\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn the first version of the [[Downfall of Númenor]], both \"[[Ar-Pharazôn|Angor]] the mighty and [[Tar-Míriel|Istar]] his queen fell like stars into the dark, and they perished out of all knowledge\", suggesting that they remained on the ships and fell with them into the great abyss and drowned.
