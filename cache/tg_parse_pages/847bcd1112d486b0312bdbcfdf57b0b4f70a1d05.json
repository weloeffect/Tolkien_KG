Now, he is the newest member of Hollywood's elite fellowship, with his name on the most successful movie trilogy of all time.\n\nWritten with Jackson's full participation, this extensive biography, illustrated with never-before-seen photos from Jackson's personal collection, tells the inside story of how a [[New Zealand]]er became Hollywood's hottest property - from the early cult classics, through Academy Award -winning success with Kate Winslet's \"Heavenly Creatures\", the abandoned \"King Kong\" remake, and the filming of \"The Lord of the Rings\", a project which was abandoned two years into pre-production, rejected by most of the other studios and then picked up by [[New Line Cinema]] in the biggest gamble in film history.\n\nDrawing upon interviews with fifty of Peter Jackson's colleagues and contemporaries, author Brian Sibley paints a portrait of a true auteur, a man gifted with single-minded determination and an artist's vision. Jackson himself is both revealing and insightful about his entire film-making life, from his first childhood steps filming in Super 8 to the grand realisation of his life's dream: \"King Kong\". Together, these joint narratives provide a truly unique and compelling insight into one of the finest cinematic minds at work today.}}\n\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Film books]]\n[[Category:Biography books]]\n[[Category:Publications by title]]\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings (film series)]]"}}}
