It was marked by a large rock standing in the path, behind which was a low arch and narrow opening into the mountain.  The cave was just large enough to accommodate [[Thorin]], the other dwarves, [[Bilbo Baggins]], [[Gandalf]], and all their [[ponies]].<ref name=\"hill\">{{H|Hill}}</ref>\n==History==\nThe Goblin-town had a main gate in one of the passes of the [[Misty Mountains]] from which they assaulted travelers. As that way was eventually too dangerous and abandoned, travelers took the (seemingly safer) High Pass, so the goblins opened the Front Porch at some point before {{TA|2941}} as an alternate means to snatch people.<ref name=h6>{{H|6}}</ref>\n\n[[Fíli]] and [[Kíli]] discovered the cave during a thunder-battle of the [[Giants|stone-giants]] in the mountains and reported it empty.  Upon entry, [[Gandalf]] lit his wand and explored it thoroughly.  Satisfied, the company dried out and relaxed before falling asleep.  Fortunately, Bilbo had a nightmare about a crack opening in the wall of the cave and upon waking found that his dream was partially true.  Goblins had already stolen the ponies through a real crack in the wall when Bilbo let out a very loud yell.  The goblins then captured Bilbo and the Dwarves, but the yell had woken up Gandalf, who escaped with a lightning-like flash that killed several of the goblins.<ref name=\"hill\"/><ref name=h6/>\n\nAfter their escape, Gandalf hoped to convince a \"more or less decent [[Giants|Giant]]\" to block the cave and make the passage safe again.<ref name=h6/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Goblin-gate]]\n{{references}}\n{{companyroute}}\n[[Category:Caves]]\n[[fi:Pääovi]]"}}}
