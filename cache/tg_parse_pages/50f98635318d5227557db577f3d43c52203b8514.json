He was originally set to direct ''[[The Hobbit (film series)]]'', but dropped out after legal matters delayed the shoot. He remained as one of the writers, though and is credited as one of the screenwiters in titles of the film series.\n\nDel Toro is known for his imaginative visuals; his major works include comic-book adaptations ''Blade II'' and ''Hellboy'', and the critically acclaimed ''El Laberinto del Fauno'' (Spanish, lit. The Labyrinth of the Faun. Released in English-speaking countries as ''Pan's Labyrinth'').\n\nAlthough he has stated he 'loved' The Hobbit, Del Toro's lack of knowledge about Tolkien's works has already worried some fans:\n: ''\"I tried my best to read [[The Lord of the Rings|Lord of the Rings]] [sic], the trilogy. I could not. I could not. They were very dense. And then one day, I bought The Hobbit. I read it and I loved it.\"''[http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2007/12/will-guillermo.html]\n\n:When asked to what extent has the work of Tolkien influenced him:\n{{quote|Not at all. I could barely finish \"The Hobbit\". Curiously, that kind of fantasy, never called out to me. I think that fairy tales are in themselves a different genre. Heroic fantasy, in general, leaves me cold. I am more interested in [[Robert E. Howard]]'s work of terror than his novels about the muscular Conan. Although there are two writers of fantasy that I think are sublime: Clark Ashton Smith and Lord Dunsany.

I don't like little guys and dragons, hairy feet, hobbits -- I've never been into that at all. I don't like sword and sorcery, I hate all that stuff.|Salon.com, October 2006 (Interview from May) [http://www.salon.com/ent/audiofile/2006/10/12/conversations_toro/]}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{WP|Guillermo del Toro}}\n* [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0868219/ Guillermo del Toro] at IMDb\n\n[[Category:Directors|Toro, Guillermo del]]\n[[Category:Mexican people|Toro, Guillermo del]]\n[[Category:People by name|Toro, Guillermo del]]\n[[de:Guillermo del Toro]]\n[[fi:Guillermo del Toro]]"}}}
