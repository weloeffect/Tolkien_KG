He loved [[horses]] and [[hounds]] as well as all trees and forests. In [[Yavanna]]'s woods in [[Valinor]], he trained his folk and beasts to hunt the evil creatures of Melkor.<ref name=vala/> He hunted all foul beasts of Morgoth, and when he blew his horn, all would know that the woods had been purged.<ref>{{S|Sindar}}</ref> Oromë was known for his terrible wrath, in contrast to [[Tulkas]], who laughed often.<ref name=vala/>\n\nOromë was the brother of [[Nessa]] and the husband of [[Vána]].<ref name=vala/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Kip Rasmussen - Orome Hunts the Monsters of Morgoth.jpg|thumb|left|''Orome Hunts the Monsters of Morgoth'' by Kip Rasmussen]]\nDuring the [[Years of the Trees]], after most of the Valar had withdrawn completely from Middle-earth and hidden themselves in [[Aman]], Oromë was the last who came to Valinor, and even then he still hunted in the forests of Middle-earth on occasion.<ref name=vala/> He visited [[Middle-earth]] during the [[Sleep of Yavanna]], hunting monsters and fell creatures and the shadows fled temporarily until he left.<ref name=s1>{{S|Days}}</ref>\n\nBeing a powerful huntsman, he was active in the struggles against [[Morgoth]], who feared Oromë in his anger. In efforts against Oromë, Melkor raised the [[Misty Mountains]] as an impediment to his riding,<ref name=Captivity/> and sowed fear among the [[Elves]] of a [[Hunter and Rider|dark Rider]] who, upon his wild horse, would devour Elves who wondered to far.\n\nOromë was the first among the Valar to find the Elves at [[Cuiviénen]]. When at length some dared to approach him, and asked his name, he answered: \"Oromë\". When they asked what it meant, he again answered: \"Oromë. To me only is it given; for I am Oromë\"; while Oromë had many glorious titles, he withheld them so that the Elves would not be afraid. When the Elves further asked the name of his horse, and if it bore any meaning, Oromë answered: \"Nahar, and he is called from the sound of his voice, when he is eager to run”.<ref>{{WJ|AD1}}</ref>\n\nIt was Oromë who gave the Elves the name \"[[Eldar]]\". Seeking to ensure their safety, Oromë accompanied the Elves from Cuiviénen to [[Beleriand]]. \n\nAfter the destruction of the Two Trees of Valinor, Oromë led his host in pursuit of Morgoth and [[Ungoliant]]. However, they were thwarted by Ungoliant's unlight.<ref name=Darkening>{{S|Darkening}}</ref>\n\nBecause Oromë was the only Vala who travelled in Middle-earth during the [[Elder Days]], it was believed, even during the [[Third Age]] that the wild [[cows|oxen]] found near the [[Sea of Rhun]] descended from his [[Kine of Araw|Kine]].<ref>{{App|South}}, Stewards of Gondor, footnote after Vorondil the Hunter, p. 1039</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nIn the aftermath of the [[Dagor Bragollach]], [[Fingolfin]] rode to Angband alone to challenge Morgoth to single combat.

This would be suggested by its usage among the Sindar and by the [[Noldorin]] form it replaced (see below).\n\n'''''Béma''''' was the name used by the [[Northmen]] for Oromë. As the great huntsman and horseman of the Valar, he and his steed Nahar were known to the horse-loving people of [[Rohan]], who claimed that their great horses, the [[Mearas]], had ancestors brought out of [[Aman|the West]] by Béma himself.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref> \nThe name ''Béma'' is also from the [[Rohanese|tongue of Rohan]] ([[J.R.R.
