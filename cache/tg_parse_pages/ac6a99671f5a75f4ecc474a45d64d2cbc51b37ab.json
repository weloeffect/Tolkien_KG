At one time Bilbo thought of subtitling the book \"a Hobbit's Holiday\". <ref>{{cite DTP|H 19.038}}</ref> Conceived as his memoirs, the book was begun by Bilbo upon his return to [[Bag End]] but not completed until his retirement in [[Rivendell]]. \n\nThe diary contained the story of Bilbo's finding of the [[One Ring]] as he originally told it: thus, Gollum willingly gives the Ring to Bilbo, and there is no trace of the Ring's hold over Gollum, something that he never corrected, even when the truth was known.<ref name=ring>{{FR|Finding}}</ref>\n\nOnly to [[Frodo Baggins]] had he shown his journal, as much as he had written (and only he knew about his secret magic ring)<ref name=ring/> and also [[Merry Brandybuck]] who took a peek secretly.<ref>{{FR|Conspiracy}}</ref>\n\nBilbo kept the diary, along with a bundle of notes and papers wrapped in old cloths, in a strongbox in his study. He took these with him to [[Rivendell]] in {{TA|3001}}.<ref>{{FR|Party}}</ref> In {{TA|3019}} Frodo brought it back to [[the Shire]] (along with [[Translations from the Elvish|three volumes]] bound in red leather, a parting gift from Bilbo). During {{TA|3020}}-{{TA|3021|n}} he nearly filled the diary's pages adding his own memoirs of the War: ''[[The Downfall of the Lord of the Rings and the Return of the King]]''.<ref name=records>{{FR|Records}}</ref> \n\nThe additional three large volumes containing the ''[[Translations from the Elvish]]'' and [[legendarium|historical and cultural writings]] were annexed to the diary, and bound together in a red case with a fifth volume added later. The volumes became known as the [[Red Book of Westmarch]], the primary source for the [[War of the Ring]] and other matters of the late [[Third Age]]. The first volume containing Bilbo's journals however was copied most by the record-keepers,<ref name=records/> who avoided making corrections out of respect.<ref name=ring/>\n==Other versions of the Legendarium==\nIn the [[The Lord of the Rings Foreword|Foreword]] of the first edition, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] poses as the \"translator\", explaining that a version of ''There and Back Again'' (being the first chapters of the Red Book),  was translated from its native language of [[Westron]] and was the basis for the modern novel published as ''[[The Hobbit]]''. The quote above is an \"explanation\" from Tolkien for the difference in tone between the two books.\n\nThe Foreword, including the reference to Bilbo's journal, was removed for the [[1965]] American [[Ballantine Books]] edition, and the [[1966]] British second edition, replaced by a new Foreword ever since.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. lxx</ref> However the concept that the two books are \"translations\" persiste throughout, especially in [[Appendix F]].\n\n{{references|notes}}\n\n[[Category:Books and documents within the legendarium]]"}}}
