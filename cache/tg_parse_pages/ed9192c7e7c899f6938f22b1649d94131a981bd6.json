However, after the host of the [[Naugrim]] had plundered [[Menegroth]], their father Dior brought his entire family to the Thousand Caves to renew the kingdom of [[Doriath]].\n\nBut soon, after not many years had passed, a messenger brought the [[Nauglamír]] to Dior, which told him that Beren and Lúthien were gone from the world. The news that the Necklace of the Dwarves, which bore one of the [[Silmarils]], was in Dior's keeping provoked the sons of [[Fëanor]] to attack Menegroth. \n\nIn the ensuing conflict, both Dior and Nimloth were slain and Eluréd and Elurín were captured, while Elwing escaped with the Silmaril. The two young boys were then taken into the woods by the servants of [[Celegorm]], in retribution for their lord's death, and left to starve.\n\n[[Maedhros]], the eldest son of [[Fëanor]], however repented and sought for the two but never found them and their fate remained unknown.<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>\n\nIt was afterwards said that the brothers were lost and died,<ref name=beor>{{WJ|West}}, ''(i) The House of Bëor</ref> however some accounts say that they were saved by wild birds, and eventually found their way in secret back to [[Ossiriand]].<ref name=GA>{{GA|5}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe [[Sindarin]] name of '''Eluréd''' is said to mean the same as the boy's father's name, [[Eluchíl]], that is, \"Heir of Elu\".<ref name=index/> Therefore it contains the name [[Elu]] and the [[Taliska|Bëorian]] word ''rêda'' \"heir\".<ref>{{PM|Ros}}, p. 369</ref>\n\nThe name '''Elurín''' in [[Sindarin]] means \"Remembrance of Elu\".<ref name=index/>\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | |,|-|-|-|.| | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | MEL |y| ELU | | ELM | | |MEL=[[Melian]]|ELU=[[Thingol]]<br /><small>''d. {{FA|503}}''</small>|ELM=[[Elmo]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | |!| | | | | |!| | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | |!| | | | | GAL | | |GAL=[[Galadhon]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | |!| | | |,|-|^|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree | | BER |y| LTH | | GLT | | CEL |CEL=[[Celeborn]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>|BER=[[Beren]]<br /><small>''{{FA|432}} - {{FA|503|n}}''</small>|LTH=[[Lúthien]]<br /><small>''{{YT|1200}} - {{FA|503}}''</small>|GLT=[[Galathil]]<br /><small>''b. {{YT}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | |!| | | | | |!| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | DIO |~|y|~| NIM | | | | |DIO=[[Dior]]<br /><small>''{{FA|470}} - {{FA|506|n}}''</small>|NIM=[[Nimloth (elf of Doriath)|Nimloth]]<br /><small>''d. {{FA|506}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |,|-|^|-|v|-|-|-|.| | |}}\n{{familytree | EAR |y| ELW | | RED | | RIN | |EAR=[[Eärendil]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA|503}}''</small>|ELW=[[Elwing]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA|503}}''</small>|RED='''ELURÉD'''<br /><small>''{{FA|500}} - c. {{FA|507|n}}''</small>|RIN='''ELURÍN'''<br /><small>''{{FA|500}} - c. {{FA|507|n}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree | |,|-|^|-|.| | | | | | | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | RON | | ROS | | | | | | | | | |RON=[[Elrond]]<br /><small>''b. {{FA|532}}''</small>|ROS=[[Elros]]<br /><small>''{{FA|532}} - {{SA|442}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\n=== Eluréd ===\nIn an early stage, Eluréd was called \"[[Elbereth]]\", an [[Ilkorin]] name containing the word ''bereth'' \"valor\".
