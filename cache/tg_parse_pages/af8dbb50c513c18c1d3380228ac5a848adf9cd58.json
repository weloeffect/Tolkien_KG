Unlike his brave folk, he was a craven that \"fawned upon [[Meglin]]\". He was said to be heavy and squat, being the only one of the [[Gondothlim]] to ride at battle.<ref name=Gondolin>{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|173}}<ref group=note>This early Elven character is quite exceptional, no Elf is described again as heavy and squat.</ref> He used to visit many times a day the house of [[Tuor]], loving the good wine and food he received there.<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|191}}\n\nWhen [[Melko]]'s armies approached the city, he and Meglin alone convinced King [[Turgon]] to hold the city and guard the treasures, and though Meglin spoke he backed him up. In the beginning of the [[Fall of Gondolin]], Meglin's plan was to attack Tuor's house, and ordered Salgant to delay Tuor and his [[folk of the Wing]] and take them into the deadliest of the battle. However, Salgant became frightened, rode home and \"lay... aquake on his bed\".<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|175–7}}\n\nAs the battle went worse, Turgon ordered him to the [[Great Market]] to reinforce [[Glorfindel]] and the [[house of the Golden Flower]]. But in his treachery he concealed this to his folk, saying they had to garrison the [[Lesser Market]], where he lived. There his men fretted, abandoning Salgant, and with their deeds in battle they could redeem the cowardice of their lord.<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|182}}\n\nIt is suggested that he either perished by fire upon his bed or became a buffoon of Melko, \"an ill fate for a noble of the good race of the Gnomes\". It is said later that the young [[Eärendel]] mourned him, because he had \"told him quaint tales or played drolleries with him at time\".<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|190–1}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[Gnomish]] name ''Salgant'' is not glossed, but in the later [[Noldorin]] it was changed to '''''Talagand''''' (\"Harper\").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry \"ÑGAL-\"</ref> The [[Qenya]] cognate was '''''Salakanto'''''.<ref>{{PE|13}}, p. 104</ref>\n\n{{references|notes}}\n{{HousesofGondolin}} \n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Gnomes]]\n[[Category:Gnomish names]]\n[[Category:Gondolindrim]]\n[[de:Salgant]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/elfes/noldor/salgant]]\n[[fi:Salgant]]"}}}
