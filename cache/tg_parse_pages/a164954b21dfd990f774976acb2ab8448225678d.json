Updated Retrieved 2010-09-01.</ref> Therefore whether or not fan fiction is 'allowed' is at the discretion of individual authors: few will permit derivative work by fans to be published on a commercial basis, but the existence of non-commercial fan fiction on the internet is, generally speaking, tolerated, if nothing else by virtue of inaction.
