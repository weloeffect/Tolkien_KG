She was one of the twenty-four children at [[The Feast of Good Children]] when young Smith was present and ate the [[Fay-star]]. Nell had been disappointed to find no lucky trinket in her slice of the [[Great Cake]] served at the Feast, but Smith gave her the silver coin he had found.\n\nNell became Smith's wife and together they had two children, [[Nan Smithson|Nan]] and [[Ned Smithson|Ned]]. She and the children knew about the star on Smith's forehead because they sometimes saw it shining upon his brow.<ref>{{SOWM|Smith}}</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree |RID|y|ROS| | | |NOK| | |RID=[[Master Cook Rider|Rob Rider]]|ROS=[[Rose Sangster]]|NOK=[[Nokes]]}}\n{{familytree | | | |!| | | | | | | |:| | | |}}\n{{familytree | | |DTR|y|VSM| | |:| | | |DTR=[[Ella]]|VSM=[[Joe Smith of West-side]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |!| | | |,|-|^|-|-|-|-|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree | | | | |SMI|y|NEL| | | | | |SIS|SMI=[[Smith Smithson]]|NEL='''NELL SMITHSON'''|SIS=Sister}}\n{{familytree | | | | | |,|-|^|-|.| | | | | | | |!| |}}\n{{familytree | | | | |NED| |NAN|y|WRI| |TIM|NED=[[Ned Smithson]]|NAN=[[Nan Smithson]]|WRI=[[Tom Wright]]|TIM=[[Tim of Townsend]]}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | | |!| | | | | |}}\n{{familytree | | | | | | | | | | |TOM| | | | |TOM=[[Tom (son of Nan)|Tom]]}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Smith of Wootton Major]]"}}}
