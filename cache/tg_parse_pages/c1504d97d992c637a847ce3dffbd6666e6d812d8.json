Auden]] and published in ''[[English and Medieval Studies Presented to J.R.R. Tolkien on the Occasion of his Seventieth Birthday]]'' ([[1962]]). The poem was mirrored by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] in the poem \"[[For W.H.A.]]\", published as an answer.\n\n==The poem==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nNecessity knows no speech: not even\nShakespeare can say\nWhat must be said so well as Frisch's bees convey\nVital instructions by ballet,\nNor do Jack and Jill, like thrushes,\nGrow outspoken under May's compulsion.\nA scream can be uncontrollable and yawning a rudeness\nOne has to be excused, but free\nSpeech is tautology.\n\nWho means ''Good-morning'' reveals he is not\nNapoleon or\nNapoleon's cook but quite as born, a first author,\nReady in turn to answer for\nA story he cannot invent\nAnd must leave to others to tell with what\nPrejudice they prefer. Social charmers daren't invite comment\nAnd a chatterbox doesn't: in\nSpeech, if true, deeds begin.\n\nIf not, there's International Babel,\nIn which murders\nAre a sanitary measure and stockbrokers\nIntegrity-ridden for sirs\nWho think big, where noises abound\nFor throats to hire whose doom is to compel\nAttention: Its Void costs money, being flood-lit, wired for sound,\nWith banner headlines guaranteed\nAnd applause pre-recorded.\n\nBut Dame Philology is our Queen still,\nQuick to comfort\nTruth-loving hearts in their mother-tongue (to report\nOn the miracles she has wrought\nIn the U.K., the N.E.D.\nTakes fourteen tomes): She suffers no evil,\nAnd a statesman still, so her grace prevent, may keep a treaty,\nA poor commoner arrive at\nThe Proper Name for his cat.\n\nNo hero is immortal till he dies\nNor is tongue,\nBut a lay of Beowulf's language, too, can be sung,\nIgnoble, maybe, to the young,\nHaving no monsters and no gore\nTo speak of, yet not without its beauties\nFor those who have learned to hope: a lot of us are grateful for\nWhat J. R. R. Tolkien has done\nAs bard to Anglo-Saxon.\n</poem>\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Short Ode to Philologist, A}}\n[[Category:Poems]]"}}}
