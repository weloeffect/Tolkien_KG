Once men of Near Harad made an alliance with those of [[Khand]] and with the [[Wainriders]] to attack Gondor. King [[Ondoher]] anticipated their strike, and created a [[Southern Army]] to defend his land against them. Under the command of [[Eärnil II|Eärnil]], the Southern Army destroyed the army of Harad in [[South Ithilien]].<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Ondoher</ref><ref name=\"Cirion\">{{UT|Northmen}}, including note 14</ref> It seems likely that many of the [[Haradrim]] who troubled Gondor, actually were men of Near Harad.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''1982-1997: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''\n:Several settlements, sites, hills and rivers in Near Harad are mentioned in the MERP module ''[[Southern Gondor: The Land]]''.<ref>{{ICE|2021}}</ref>\n\n'''2024: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Near Harad map.jpg|thumb|Map of Near Harad in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n:The land called Near Harad by [[Gondor]]ians is known to its inhabitants as \"Shagâna\", the Fair Land. The first explorable half of Shagâna, the valley of river \"Ikorbân\", was added with the ''Legacy of [[Morgoth]]'' expansion in 2024. The second half, \"Mûr Ghala, the Ridge of Plenty\", was released with the ''Kingdoms of Harad'' expansion in 2025. Unlike the scorched arid lands of \"Jarmát\", or [[Far Harad]], Shagâna has more temperate climate and features a mix of river valleys, wetlands, and forests as well as arid highlands, deserts, and rocky canyons. [[Avari|Kintai]] [[elves]] and [[Blacklocks|Temámir]] [[dwarves]] live in Shagâna along with the humans but remain secluded and rarely deal with the outsiders.\n\n: Shagâna had contended with invaders for much of its history, whether they came from [[Númenor]], [[Gondor]], [[Umbar]], [[Khand]], or [[Far Harad]]. For much of the [[Third Age]], a sovereign kingdom of Hamât ruled much of Shagâna, though its exact reach ebbed and flowed over time. It finally fell around {{TA|2820}}, when all of Shagâna was conquered by the southern Empire of Ordâkh from [[Far Harad]], who brought with it forced worship of the Church of [[Sauron]]. The Shagâni were oppressed but remembered their history, and when news came of the defeat of Sauron and the death of the [[Black serpent|Ordâkhai Hûl (King)]] were quick to push out the Ordâkhai and begin to reassert their independence. The Empire of Ordâkh, though diminished in land and power, was quick to reassert itself under a new Hûl, leading to renewed hostilities in Shagâna by summer of [[Third Age 3019]].\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.lindefirion.net/maps/harnendor.jpg Fanon map of Near Harad] by Sampsa Rydman\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Southern lands]]"}}}
