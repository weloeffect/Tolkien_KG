The road looped several times in tight switchbacks upwards for hundreds of feet and gave it the appearance of an ascending stair, hence the name.  The loops also gave any defenders protection from any enemy below.  At each turn in the road were large standing stone carved to resemble squatting men with stumpy arms and fat bellies.  These ancient statues were called the [[Púkel-men]] by the [[Rohirrim]].<ref name=\"Muster\">{{RK|V3}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Stair of the Hold was constructed by long-forgotten [[Men of the Mountains|Men]] of the [[White Mountains]] during the [[Dark Years]].\n\nThe first men of [[Rohan]] to climb the Stair of the Hold were King [[Brego]] and his son [[Baldor]].<ref name=\"Muster\"/>  Brego returned in {{TA|2569}} to attempt the [[Paths of the Dead]] and never returned.<ref>{{App|Mark}}</ref>\n\n[[Aragorn]], [[Gimli]], [[Legolas]], and the [[Grey Company]] ascended the Stair of the Hold on [[7 March]] {{TA|3019}} but did not descend, taking instead the Paths of the Dead.  [[Théoden]] and his riders (with [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]]) went up the road on [[9 March]] and rode down on [[10 March|the 10th]].<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2013: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Dunharrow Stair is a major landmark in the \"[[King's Lands|Kingstead]]\" area of [[Westemnet]].\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Rohan]]\n[[Category:Roads and streets]]\n[[fi:Linnakkeen portaat]]"}}}
