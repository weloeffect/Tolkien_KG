Its fresh leaves could be boiled to produce a sensory-enhancing steam, which allowed both Elves and Men to see as well in the dark as Dwarves could. Dwarves, however, would have their vision reduced.<ref name=healer>{{ICE|2026}}, p. 89</ref>\n\n:'''''Black Clover''''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] ''Mornast'', [[Quenya|Q.]] ''Mornasto'') was a rare and dangerous clover in the higher valley of [[Lebennin]]. Its pollen gave a burning sensation to the lungs, followed by coughing and vomiting. The [[Drúedain]] used it in a poison paste.<ref name=healer/><ref>{{ICE|2010}}, p. 171</ref>\n\n==External links==\n\n*{{WP|Clover}}\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Flowers]]"}}}
