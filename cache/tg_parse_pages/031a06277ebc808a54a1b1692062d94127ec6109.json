This scene was not featured in the theatrical release of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[Gríma]] arrives at [[Isengard]], now a place of pits and forges rather than trees and greenery. In [[Orthanc]], [[Saruman]] is irate with the new status of [[Gandalf|Gandalf the White]]. Gríma tells him of [[Legolas|an elf]], [[Gimli|a dwarf]], and [[Aragorn|a man]] following Gandalf. Saruman questions if the man was from [[Gondor]]. In response, Gríma tells him that he was from the north and described a strange ring he wore. From the description, Saruman deduces this to be the [[Ring of Barahir]], and that therefore Gandalf thinks he has found the lost king of Gondor in this man. However this does not affect Saruman's plans, and he decides to continue with his attack on [[Rohan]]. \n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers scenes|25]]"}}}
