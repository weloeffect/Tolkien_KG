Tolkien (1892-1973), best known for his literary classics The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings.<br>\nThe exhibition considers Tolkien’s work through the lens of manuscripts, in terms of both the materials that Tolkien studied as a medieval philologist and the manuscripts that he created while developing his collected writings on Middle-earth. Professor Tolkien was deeply immersed in the complexities of manuscripts, and this exhibition will illustrate how different aspects of the manuscript tradition found expression within Tolkien’s scholarly life and in his creative writing.<br>\nFounded on Marquette's [https://www.marquette.edu/library/archives/tolkien.php J.R.R. Tolkien Collection], the exhibition also includes items borrowed from other repositories, including a significant number of Tolkien manuscripts and artwork from the [[Bodleian Libraries]] at the University of Oxford. Many of the 147 items in the exhibition have not previously been exhibited or published.<br>\nThe exhibition is accompanied by a 196-page hardbound catalogue that reproduces the complete object list, and includes introductory essays by exhibition co-curators William M.
