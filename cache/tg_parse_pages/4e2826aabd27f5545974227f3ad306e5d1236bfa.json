Tolkien - Old Man Willow.jpg|thumb|''Old Man Willow'' by J.R.R. Tolkien shows the '''Withywindle''' flowing in the background]]\nThe '''Withywindle''' was a minor tributary of the River [[Baranduin|Brandywine]] that flowed through the [[Old Forest]] on the borders of [[the Shire]].<ref>{{FR|Part}}</ref> \n==Course==\n[[File:Mark Fisher - Withywindle.png|thumb|Map of the Withywindle]]The river began in the [[Barrow-downs]] and flowed southwest through the Old Forest until merging with the Brandywine. The [[Dingle]], the Withywindle valley, was said to be the heart of all the strange happenings in the Old Forest.\n\nThe river flowed into Brandywine at the south Buckland. At the mouth of the Withywindle, in the north bank, there was the [[Grindwall]], a guarded hythe - or haven - that was beyond the protection of the [[High Hay]], and had a fence extending into the water.<ref name=\"ATB\">{{ATB|Preface}}</ref>\n\nFurther, there was the small village of [[Breredon]] between the [[Haysend|end]] of the [[High Hay]] and the Brandywine. The [[Elvet-isle]] in the Withywindle was home to [[swans]].<ref name=\"ATB\"/>\n\n==History==\nLong ago, Tom had found [[Goldberry]], the River-daughter, in a pool down the Withywindle, and at the end of every summer he would go along the river to gather water-lilies for her. He was on his last trip of the year when he encountered the Hobbits.\n\nWhen [[Frodo Baggins]] and his companions entered the Old Forest on 26 September 26 {{TA|3018}}, they found themselves drawn toward the Withywindle valley despite their intentions, and on the banks of the river they encountered [[Old Man Willow]], an ancient tree whose hatred of all peoples who walked free on the earth permeated the woods. The Hobbits were lulled to sleep by Old Man Willow's spell.  Frodo was pushed into the Withywindle and was held under by the willow's roots until [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] saved him, and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] were trapped inside Old Man Willow.  They were rescued by [[Tom Bombadil]].<ref>{{FR|I6}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''withy'' means \"willow\" (common element in English place-names) and ''windle'' means \"spindle\" or \"reel\" and is supposed to be translation from [[Hobbitish]].<ref name=\"Nomen\">{{HM|N}}, p. 779</ref>\n\nBesides the meaning \"willow-reel\", the name is also a word-play of the word \"Withywind\", a type of bindweed, or [[wikipedia:convolvulus|convolvulus]], a harmful weed that twines itself around other plants. The word withywind means \"flexibly strong, entangle\".<ref name=\"Nomen\" />\n\n[[David Salo]] has suggested it represents a speculative [[Old English|Old Hobbitish]] for *''Withigwindel''. He noted that the natural Old English interpretation of such a noun would have been \"twisted willow (branches)\" referring to \"a basket made of willow-branches\"<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=https://tolkienlistsearch.herokuapp.com/message/5e9c35b63ee6a6c41e9862d6|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]|accessed=9 March 2013}}</ref> rather than the winding shape of the river.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Withywindle.jpg|thumb|left|Withywindle in '[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:As Withywindle flows through the Old Forest, signs of long-abandoned habitation can be found along its shores.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Eriador]]\n[[Category:Rivers]]\n[[de:Weidenwinde]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/eaux/eriador/tournesaules]]\n[[fi:Halavainen]]"}}}
