It was derived from an earlier language called [[Common Telerin]]. When the [[Noldor]] came back to Middle-earth, they adopted the Sindarin language, although they believed their native [[Quenya]] more beautiful.\n\nThe king of the Teleri in [[Doriath]][[Thingol|, Elu Thingol]], upon learning of the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë]], declared that [[Quenya]], the language of the Noldor, should be prohibited in his lands. Since Noldor were dwelling in a Sindarin-speaking land, and because of the ban placed upon their native tongue ( although it did not directly affect them), they gradually switched entirely to Sindarin.  This change between languages also affected their names, such as ''Finwë-Ñolofinwë'' to [[Fingolfin]], and ''Turukáno'' to [[Turgon]].\n\nWhen the [[Elves of Beleriand]] first encountered the dwarves, they could not understand a word of the [[Khuzdul|tongue of the Dwarves]]. Dwarves were swift to learn and indeed were more willing to learn Sindarin than to teach their own to those of alien race.<ref>{{S|10}}</ref>\n\nBefore the downfall, most of the [[Men]] of [[Númenor]] also knew Sindarin, though the common language there was [[Adûnaic]]. Knowledge of it was kept in the [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] realms-in-exile [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]], especially amongst the learned. While [[Westron]] (descended from Adûnaic) became the most common language in the west of Middle-earth during the [[Third Age]], Sindarin remained the everyday language of Elves. At the end of the Third Age there were probably more Men who spoke Sindarin or knew Quenya than there were Elves who either spoke the former or knew the latter. In Gondor Sindarin was an acquired polite language and used by people of more pure Númenórean descent if they wanted to be polite.<ref name=\"Letter347\">{{L|347}}</ref> All Men of high lineage and all who learned how to read and write of the [[Faithful]] of the [[Dúnedain]] in Middle-earth used Sindarin, even as a daily language. It is said that Sindarin even became the native language in some families.<ref name=\"Atani\">{{PM|Atani}}</ref> They used Sindarin to give names to places in Middle-earth<ref name=\"Atani\" /> and usually changed the names that they adopted from those given by older inhabitants to fit the style of Sindarin<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, note 73</ref>.\n\nThe written script alphabet of the Elven languages is typically '''[[Tengwar]]''', although '''[[Cirth]]''' (itself originally intended specifically for Sindarin) can also be used.\n\n==Grammar==\nSindarin is mainly analytic, though traits of its highly inflected progenitor can still be seen.\n\n===Phonology===\nSindarin was designed to have a [[Welsh]]-like phonology. It has most of the same sounds and similar phonotactics.\n\n{| rules=\"all\" style=\"text-align:center; border:1px solid darkgrey; border-collapse:collapse\" cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''Letter'''\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''[[wikipedia:IPA|IPA]]'''\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''Example'''\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''Notes'''\n|-\n|a, ä||{{IPA|a}}||[[Aragorn|'''A'''r'''a'''gorn]]||Sindarin ''a'' is most like ''a'' in English ''father'' or ''a'' in Spanish ''mambo''.

''ae'' is similar to ''ai'', but ''ai'' ends at a ''less'' open vowel height.  J.R.R. Tolkien said that ''ae'' and ''ai'' can be pronounced the same if a person cannot tell the difference between them.\n|-\n|au, aw||{{IPA|a͡ʊ}}||[[Glaurung|Gl'''au'''rung]]; [[Oromë#Etymology|Ar'''aw''']]||Sindarin ''au'' is most like ''ou'' in English ''thousand'' or like ''ow'' in English ''cow''.  It is never pronounced like ''au'' in English ''cause'' or like ''aw'' in English ''law''.  The spellings ''au'' and ''aw'' are the same sound, but ''aw'' is preferred at the ends of words, as in ''[[Oromë#Etymology|Araw]]''.\n|-\n|b||{{IPA|b}}||[[Beleriand|'''B'''eleriand]]||&nbsp;\n|-\n|c||{{IPA|k}}||[[Celeborn|'''C'''eleborn]]||Always hard ''c'' like in English ''cake''.

It is also similar to ''ju'' in Mexican Spanish ''Juan''.  It is never pronounced like ordinary ''w'' in English ''wail''.  If nothing else works, try pronouncing ''w'' while whispering.\n|-\n|i||{{IPA|ɪ, j}}||[[Minas Tirith|M'''i'''nas T'''i'''r'''i'''th]]||Sindarin ''i'' is usually pronounced as the ''i'' in ''sick''. But sometimes Sindarin ''i'' is more like ''y'' in English ''young''&mdash;it is this way at the beginning of a word before a vowel, and in certain unstressed syllables before vowels.  (For instance, ''[[Doriath]]'' is a compound of ''[[dôr]]+[[iath]]'', where ''[[iath]]'' is just one syllable.)\n|-\n|í||{{IPA|iː}}||[[Círdan|C'''í'''rdan]]||Sindarin ''í'' is pronounced noticeably longer in duration than Sindarin ''i'', and has a different quality.  Sindarin ''í'' is most like ''i'' in English ''ink'' or like ''i'' in Spanish ''gringo''.

But it is like ''ll'' in [[Welsh]] or ''ł'' in Navajo, or [[Quenya]] ''hl''.  More specifically, it is a ''voiceless alveolar lateral'', like ''s'' when spoken in a lateral lisp.  If nothing else works, try pronouncing ''l'' while whispering.\n|-\n|ll||{{IPA|lː}}||[[mellon|me'''ll'''on]]||Sindarin ''ll'' is pronounced for an even longer duration than Sindarin ''l'', but otherwise is pronounced the same.\n|-\n|m||{{IPA|m}}||[[Mordor|'''M'''ordor]]||&nbsp;\n|-\n|mh||{{IPA|ṽ}}||&nbsp;||An Archaic Sindarin sound, a \"spirant\" ''m'', just like Gaelic ''mh''.  This sound became the same as ''v'' since at least the First Age, and ''mh'' as a spirant ''m'' does not appear even in [[The Silmarillion]]-style Sindarin spellings, so that spellings like ''[[Tinúviel]]'' are preferred over ''*Tinúmhiel''.  Suffice it to say that this spelling of ''mh'' is not used in [[The Lord of the Rings]]-style [[Third Age]] Sindarin either.\n|-\n|mm||{{IPA|mː}}||[[Rammas Echor|Ra'''mm'''as]]||Sindarin ''mm'' is pronounced for an even longer duration than Sindarin ''m'', but otherwise is pronounced the same.\n|-\n|n||{{IPA|n}}||[[Nevrast|'''N'''evrast]]||&nbsp;\n|-\n|nc||{{IPA|ŋk}}||[[Orthanc|Ortha'''nc''']]||Like ''nk'' in English ''think''.\n|-\n|ng||{{IPA|ŋ(ɡ)}}||[[Fingolfin|Fi'''ng'''olfin]]; [[Glamdring|Glamdri'''ng''']]||Represents {{IPA|[ŋɡ]}} between two vowels (like ''ng'' in English ''finger''), and {{IPA|[ŋ]}} everywhere else (like ''ng'' in English ''singer'').

Either pronunciation is suitable, but it ''never'' has a ''w'' off-glide like ''ow'' in English ''show''.\n|-\n|ó||{{IPA|ɔː}}||[[Dor-lómin|Dor-l'''ó'''min]]||Sindarin ''ó'' is pronounced just noticeably longer in duration than Sindarin ''o'', but otherwise is pronounced the same.\n|-\n|ô||{{IPA|ɔːː}}||&nbsp;||Sindarin ''ô'' is pronounced for an even longer duration than Sindarin ''ó'', usually in single-syllable words.  But it is permissible to pronounce it the same as ''ó''.\n|-\n|oe||{{IPA|o͡e}}||&nbsp;||Sindarin ''oe'' is somewhat like ''oi'' in English ''join''.  Though this is not ''completely'' accurate because ''oe'' ends with an off-glide that sounds like Sindarin ''e'', it is a suitable pronunciation because there is no Sindarin ''oi'' to contrast with.  Alternately, ''oe'' is like ''oe'' in Hawaiian ''Aloha ʻOe''.\n|-\n|œ||{{IPA|ø}}||[[Nirnaeth Arnoediad|Nírnaeth Arn'''œ'''diad]]||An Archaic Sindarin sound, at one time pronounced like French ''eu'', ''oe'' or ''oeu'' or like German/Swedish ''ö'' or like Danish/Norwegian ''ø''.  In the [[Third Age]] it is pronounced just like Sindarin ''e'', so it is suitable to pronounce it like ''e''.  Mostly found in [[First Age]] Sindarin words, and most famously in ''[[Nirnaeth Arnoediad|Nírnaeth Arnœdiad]]''.  [[The Lord of the Rings]]-style Third Age Sindarin spellings do not use ''œ'' at all, only ''e'', such as ''[[Ered Luin]]'' instead of ''*Œrœd Luin''.\n|-\n|p||{{IPA|p}}||[[Pengolodh|'''P'''engolodh]]||&nbsp;\n|-\n|ph||{{IPA|f, fː}}||[[Ephel Dúath|E'''ph'''el Dúath]]||Represents {{IPA|[f]}} when final, {{IPA|[fː]}} everywhere else.\n|-\n|r||{{IPA|r}}||[[Boromir|Bo'''r'''omi'''r''']]||Sindarin ''r'' is always trilled or at least flapped wherever possible, like in Scottish English.

The most usual plural patterns are:\n\n{| rules=\"all\" style=\"border:1px solid darkgray; border-collapse:collapse\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''In Non-final Syllables'''\n|-\n|a > e||galadh > gelaidh\n|-\n|e > e||bereth > berith\n|-\n|i > i||fireb > firib\n|-\n|o > e||golodh > gelydh\n|-\n|ó > ó||Ódhel > Ódhil\n|-\n|u > y||tulus > tylys\n|-\n|ú > ú||''(no example available)''\n|-\n|y > y||''(no example available)''\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''In Final Syllables'''\n|-\n|a > ai, e||adan > edain, parf > perf<ref group=\"note\">''a'' becomes ''e'' in consonant clusters.</ref>\n|-\n|â > ai||tâl > tail\n|-\n|e > i||edhel > edhil\n|-\n|ê > î||hên > [[hîn]]\n|-\n|i > i||brennil > brennil\n|-\n|î > î||hîr > hîr\n|-\n|o > y||annon > ennyn\n|-\n|ô > ui||thôn > thuin\n|-\n|u > y||urug > yryg\n|-\n|û > ui||dûr > duir\n|-\n|y > y||ylf > ylf\n|-\n|ŷ > ŷ||mŷl > mŷl\n|-\n|au, o > oe||aur > oer, nibinnog > nibinnoeg<ref group=\"note\">Final ''o'' from ancient ''ā'' or ''au'' becomes ''oe''.</ref>\n|}\n\nNote that ''ai'' can sometimes become ''î''.\n\nThe reason for this is that the primitive plural ending ''-ī'' (still present in Quenya as ''-i'' after consonants and -e) affected the vowels in the word by making them higher and fronter.  After this sound change occurred, the suffix ''-ī'' disappeared when all final vowels were lost:\n\n{| rules=\"all\" style=\"border:1px solid darkgray; border-collapse:collapse\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''In -jā Words'''\n|-\n|ai > î||cair > cîr (from k'''i'''rjā)\n|-\n|ai > î||fair > fîr (from ph'''e'''rjā)\n|-\n|ai > ai||bain > bain (from b'''a'''njā)\n|-\n|ui > ui||fuir > fuir (from ph'''o'''rjā)\n|-\n|ui > ui||ruin > ruin (from r'''u'''njā\n|}\n\n====Class Plural====\nSindarin also has several suffixes which denote a so-called class plural.  For example, ''-ath'' indicates a group of something, e.g. ''elenath'' from ''[[elen]]'' (an archaic form of ''êl''), meaning \"star\" and ''-ath''. It means \"a group of stars\" or \"all the stars in the sky\". Another ending, ''-rim'', is used to indicate a race, e.g. ''nogothrim'' from ''nogoth'' — \"dwarf\" and ''-rim'', meaning \"the race of dwarves\". The ending ''-hoth'' is generally used in an unfriendly sense, e.g. ''gaurhoth'' from ''gaur'' — \"werewolf\" and ''-hoth'', meaning \"werewolf-host\".\n\n===Mutation===\nSindarin has a complex series of mutations. There are three main different types of mutations: ''soft mutation'' (or lenition), ''nasal mutation'' and ''stop'' (occlusive) ''mutation''. Additionally, a ''mixed mutation'' and a ''sibilant mutation'' are also observed after certain particles or prepositions. Finally, it is presumed that Sindarin also once had what we could call an ''archaic spirantal mutation'' (also sometimes called ''liquid mutation'' by scholars). It is still uncertain whether this mutation is still productive or if it only occurs in ancient constructs.\n\nInitial mutations must not be confused with assimilations that may occur in compound words (such as, for instance, in the names ''[[Araphor]]'', ''[[Arassuil]]'', and ''[[Caradhras]]'').\n\nThe following table outlines how different consonants are affected by the different mutations:\n\n{| rules=\"all\" style=\"border:1px solid darkgrey; border-collapse:collapse\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''Basic'''\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''Soft'''\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''Nasal'''\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''Mixed'''\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''Stop'''\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''Liquid'''\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''Sibilant'''\n|-\n|p...||b...||ph...||b...||ph...||ph...||ph...\n|-\n|t...||d...||th...||d...||th...||th...||th...\n|-\n|c...||g...||ch...||g...||ch...||ch...||ch...\n|-\n|b...||v...||m...||b...||b...||v...||b...\n|-\n|d...||dh...||n...||d...||d...||dh...||d...\n|-\n|g...||'...||ñ...||g...||g...||'...||g...\n|-\n|b(x)...||v(x)...||b(x)...||b(x)...||b(x)...||v(x)...||b(x)...\n|-\n|d(x)...||dh(x)...||d(x)...||d(x)...||d(x)...||dh(x)...||d(x)...\n|-\n|g(x)...||'(x)...||g(x)...||g(x)...||g(x)...||'(x)...||g(x)...\n|-\n|m...||v...||m...||m...||m...||v...||m...\n|-\n|h...||ch...||ch...||ch...||ch...||ch...||ch...\n|-\n|s...||h...||s...||h...||s...||s...||s...\n|-\n|r...||r...||r...||r...||r...||r...||rh...\n|-\n|l...||l...||l...||l...||l...||l...||lh...\n|-\n|i...||i...||i...||i...||i...||i...||ch...\n|-\n|rh...||thr...||thr...||'r...||thr...||'r...||rh...\n|-\n|lh...||thl...||thl...||'l...||thl...||'l...||lh...\n|-\n|hw...||chw...||chw...||'w...||thw...||'w...||hw...\n|}\n\nHere the apostrophe indicates elision.\n\nWords beginning in ''b-'', ''d-'', or ''g-'' which descend from older ''mb-'', ''nd-'', or ''ng-'' are affected differently by the mutations:\n\n{| rules=\"all\" style=\"border:1px solid darkgrey; border-collapse:collapse\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''Basic'''\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''Soft'''\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''Nasal'''\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''Mixed'''\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''Stop'''\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''Liquid'''\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''Sibilant'''\n|-\n|b...||m...||mb...||mb...||mb...||b...||b...\n|-\n|d...||n...||nd...||nd...||nd...||d...||d...\n|-\n|g...||ñ...||ng...||ng...||ng...||g...||g...\n|}\n\nTake, for example, the deictic article ''i'', which triggers soft mutation. When added to a word like ''[[tâl]]'', it becomes ''i dâl''. In Sindarin's phonological history, ''t'' became ''d'' in the middle of a word. Because ''i tâl'' at the time was considered one word, the ''t'' became ''d'', and thus ''i dâl''. However, without the article the word is still ''tâl''.\n\nMutation is triggered in various ways:\n*Soft mutation, the most widely occurring mutation, is triggered by the singular article ''i'', the prefixes ''athra-, ath-, [[go-]], [[go-|gwa-]],'' and ''ú-'', as well as the prepositions ''ab, am, be, di, na,'' and ''nu,'' and after ''avo''. It also affects an adjective following a noun and the object of a verb.\n*Nasal mutation is triggered by the plural article ''in'', and the prepositions ''an'' and ''dan''.\n*Mixed mutation is triggered by the genitive article ''en'', and the prepositions ''ben, erin, nan, 'nin,'' and ''uin''.\n*Stop mutation is triggered by the prepositions ''ed, ned,'' and ''o(d)''.\n*Liquid mutation is presumably triggered by the preposition ''or''.\n*Sibilant mutation is triggered by the conjunction ''ah'' and preposition ''oh''.\n\n===Pronouns===\nSindarin pronouns, like those in English, still maintain some case distinction, having nominative, accusative, possessive, and dative forms. They are one of the poorly attested features of Sindarin. While recent publications offer a clearer picture, the whole system is yet to be attested. Thus the following table will list only the personal pronouns, marking the non-attested forms with asterisks.\n\n{| rules=\"all\" style=\"border:1px solid darkgrey; border-collapse:collapse\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"gray\" |'''First Person'''\n| bgcolor=\"gray\" |\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"gray\" |'''Second Person'''\n| bgcolor=\"gray\" |\n| colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"gray\" |'''Third Person'''\n|-\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''Singular'''\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''Plural'''\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''Singular'''\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''Plural'''\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''Singular'''\n| align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''Plural'''\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''Nominative'''\n|ni*||me* / pe* (incl.)\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |\n|'''''ci''''' / '''''le''''' (form.)||'''''de'''''\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |\n|te*||'''''ti'''''\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''Accusative'''\n|'''''nin'''''||'''''ven''''' / ben*\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |\n|gin* / len*||dhen*\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |\n|'''''den'''''||din*\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''Possessive'''\n|'''''nîn'''''||'''''vîn''''' / bîn*\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |\n|gîn* / '''''lîn'''''||dhîn*\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |\n|'''''dîn'''''||dîn*\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''Dative'''\n|'''''annin'''''||'''''ammen''''' / aphen*\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |\n|echin* / allen*||annen*\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |\n|athen*||ethin*\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |'''Enclitic'''\n|'''''-(o)n'''''||'''''-(o)f''''' / '''''-(a)b'''''\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |\n|'''''-(o)g''''' / '''''-(o)l'''''||-(o)dh*\n| bgcolor=\"lightgrey\" |\n|◌̂  & '''''-(a)'''''||'''''-(a)r'''''\n|}\n\n===Verbs===\nSindarin verbs are also quite complex. The number of attested verbs in Sindarin is small, although recent publications clarify most details of conjugation. There are two main types of verbs: ''basic'' and ''derived''. Basic verbs have stems which end in a consonant, and derived verbs have stems which incorporate some sort derivational morpheme (such as a causative ending) which ends in ''-a''.\n\n====Basic Verbs====\nBasic verbs, though smaller in number than derived verbs, have a very complex conjugation which arises from Sindarin's phonological history.\n\nBasic verbs form infinitives by adding ''-i'' to the stem: ''firi'' from ''fir-''. For this reason, basic verbs are also known as \"I-verbs\". This ending causes an ''a'' or ''o'' in the stem to umlaut to ''e'': ''ceri'' from ''car-''. But Sindarin does not have much use for infinitive forms, it rather uses the gerund to achieve the same meaning by suffixing ''-ed'': ''fired'', ''cared''.\n\nFor all persons except the third person singular, the aorist/present tense is formed by the insertion of ''-i'' between the stem and the pronominal suffixes: ''firin'', ''firir''. As with the infinitive, ''-i'' causes an ''a'' or ''o'' in the stem to umlaut to ''e'': ''cerin'', ''cerir'', from ''car-''. The third person singular, because it has a zero-ending, does not require the insertion of ''-i''. This leaves the bare stem, which causes the stem vowel to become long as with most monosyllabic words: ''fîr'', ''câr''.\n\nThe past tense formation of basic verbs have some of the most complex rules due to Sindarin's phonological history. There are two (non-interchangeable) methods of conjugation for certain forms of verbs. Those whose final consonants are B, D, G, (ancient P, T, K,) employ what is called the Nasal Infixion method, while the rest employs Vowel Lengthening. Both methods also include augmentation of the stem, which duplicates the base vowel by adding it to the beginning of verbs.\n\n*An example to Nasal Infixion: †''mat-'' (the ancient form of ''mad-'' \"to eat\") becomes †''amat-'' with the augmentation of the base vowel, and †''amante'' with the infixion of ''-ne''. This yields ''avant'', ''avanne-'' in modern Sindarin (note the mutation of ''m'' to ''v'' due to lenition). Here ''avant'' means \"(he/she/it) ate\", and ''avannen'', ''avanner'' mean \"I ate\", \"they ate\".\n**After infixion, final ''b'' becomes '''-mp''' & '''-mme-'''; final ''d'' becomes '''-nt''' & '''-nne-''' (as in the example); final ''g'' becomes '''-nc''' & '''-nge-'''.\n*An example to Vowel Lengthening: †''kar-'' (in modern orthography ''car-'' \"to do, make\") becomes †''akar-'' with augmentation and ''akāre-'' with lengthening. Due to Sindarin's complex phonological history, ancient long ''a'' becomes ''o'' in polysyllabic forms, which yields ''agor'', ''agóre-'' in modern Sindarin (note the lenition of ''c'' to ''g''). Here ''agor'' means \"(he/she/it) did\", and ''agóren'', ''agórer'' mean \"I did\", \"they did\".\n**After lengthening, ''a'' becomes '''o/ó''' (as in the example); ''e'' becomes '''i/í'''; ''i'' becomes '''i/í'''; ''o'' becomes '''u/ú'''; ''y'' becomes '''u/ú''' (''*ýl-'' > ''uiul'', ''uiúle-'').\n\nThe future tense is formed by the addition of ''-atha(-)''. As with derived verbs, the final ''a'' becomes ''o'' with the addition of pronominal suffixes with the exceptions of first person plural inclusive ''-(a)b'', and third person plural ''-(a)r'': ''carathon'', ''carathar''.\n\nThe imperative is formed with the addition of ''-o'' to the stem: ''caro!'', ''mado!''.\n\n====Derived Verbs====\nDerived verbs have a much less complex conjugation because they have a thematic vowel ''a'', thus they are also known as \"A-verbs\".\n\nThe infinitive is formed with ''-o'', which replaces the ''-a'' of the stem, e.g. ''lasto'' from ''lasta-''. As this is not used, the gerund is formed with the addition of ''-(a)d'' to the stem: ''lastad''.\n\nThe aorist/present tense is formed without modification to the stem. The final ''a'' becomes ''o'' with the addition of pronominal suffixes (except ''-(a)b'' & ''-(a)r''): ''lasta'', ''laston'' from ''lasta-''.\n\nThe past tense is formed with the ending ''-nt'', which becomes ''-nne-'' with pronominal suffixes: ''lastant'', ''lastanner'' from ''lasta-''.\n\nThe future tense is formed with ''-atha(-)''. As with the aorist/present tense, the final ''a'' becomes ''o'' with the addition of pronominal suffixes: ''lastatha'', ''lastathon''.\n\nThe imperative form is identical to the infinitive: ''lasto!''.\n\n==Dialects==\nDuring the [[First Age]] there were several dialects of Sindarin:\n*''[[Doriathrin]]'' or the language of [[Doriath]], a form of the language which preserved many archaic forms;\n*''[[Falathrin]]'' or the language of the [[Falas]], later also spoken in [[Nargothrond]];\n*''[[North Sindarin]]'', the dialects originally spoken in [[Dorthonion]] and [[Hithlum]] by the Sindar, these dialects contained many unique words and were not fully intelligible with the Sindarin of [[Beleriand]] proper.\n\nWith the exception of Doriathrin, the dialects were changed under Noldorin influence, and adopted many [[Quenya]] features, as well as unique sound changes devised by the Noldor (who loved changing languages). The distinct dialects disappeared after the Noldor and Sindar were dispersed during the later [[Battles of Beleriand]]. In the refuges on the [[Isle of Balar]] and the [[Mouths of Sirion]] a new dialect arose under the refugees, which mainly took after Falathrin. During the [[Second Age]] and [[Third Age]] Sindarin was a ''lingua franca'' for all Elves and their friends, until it was displaced as the [[Westron|Common Tongue]] by [[Westron]], a descendant of [[Adûnaic]] which was heavily influenced by Sindarin.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''Sindarin'' itself is actually a [[Quenya]] word given by the [[Noldor]]in Exiles.\n\n==Other names==\nNo Sindarin word for ''Sindarin'' is known, but usually the terms '''''Edhellen''''' (\"Elvish\") and the neologism '''''Thindren''''' (\"Grey Elvish\"), a direct cognate of ''Sindarin'', are used in [[Neo-Sindarin]].\n\nSindarin is the language referred to as \"the '''Elven-tongue'''\" in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. \n\nIn a letter, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] referred to Sindarin as '''Grey Elvish'''.<ref>{{L|230}}</ref> In another manuscript he used the similar name '''Grey-elven'''.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 127</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nTolkien originally imagined that the language which would become ''Sindarin'' was spoken by the Noldor.  However, Tolkien later decided that it was the language of the Sindar. For this reason it is called \"[[Noldorin]]\" in the older material, such as the ''[[The Etymologies|Etymologies]]''. When Noldorin became Sindarin, it also adopted some features of the originally unrelated language ''[[Ilkorin]]''. Tolkien based the sound and some of the grammar of his Noldorin/Sindarin on [[Welsh]], and Sindarin displays of the consonant mutations that characterise the Celtic (especially Brythonic) languages. The language was also probably influenced to an extent by the Germanic languages, as Tolkien was a scholar of both [[Old English]] and [[Old Norse]].\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.uib.no/People/hnohf/sindarin.htm Sindarin – ''The Noble Tongue''], by [[Helge Kåre Fauskanger]] at [[Ardalambion]]\n*[http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/ Hiswelókë's Sindarin Dictionary]\n*[http://sindarin.weet.us/ I Lam Arth - The Noble Tongue], a technical study of Sindarin\n*[http://glaemscrafu.jrrvf.com/english/sindarin.html Texts and sound samples] at [[Glǽmscrafu]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=\"note\" />\n{{references}}\n{{languages}}\n[[Category:Sindarin| ]]\n[[Category:Quenya adjectives]]\n[[Category:Quenya nouns]]<!-- Note that the WORD \"Sindarin\" itself is a Quenya word. -->\n[[de:Sindarin]]\n[[fi:Sindar (kieli)]]\n[[fr:encyclo:langues:sindarin]]"}}}
