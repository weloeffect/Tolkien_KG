Stargardt Katalog 698]]''.\n\n==Excerpt==\n\n\"... I have not yet been informed what the position is with regard to German translation since one proposed translator was turned down partly owing to my criticisms. With regard to illustration, I do not myself favour any illustration of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', though, of course, the better the illustrator the less would be my objections. However, I think the question whether illustrations would be either an improvement of the book or likely to increase its sale in Germany would be one for the publisher himself to decide ... A set or series of designs by [[Fritz Möser|Möser]] to moments or figures in the story, or expressive of emotions aroused by it, would be of very great interest, but that is quite another matter ...\"\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Letter to Hans-Jörg Modlmayr (1 March 1967)]]\n*[[Letter to Hans-Jörg Modlmayr (7 December 1967)]]\n==External links==\n*[http://newboards.theonering.net/forum/gforum/perl/gforum.cgi?post=452405;sb=post_time;so=DESC;forum_view=forum_view_collapsed;guest=19262590 Tolkien - \"I have never been a lover of books for children..\"] at [http://newboards.theonering.net/forum/gforum/perl/gforum.cgi?guest=19262590 The One Ring Forums]\n{{References}}\n{{title}}\n[[Category:Letters|Modlmayr, Hans-Jorg (1967-03-16)]]"}}}
