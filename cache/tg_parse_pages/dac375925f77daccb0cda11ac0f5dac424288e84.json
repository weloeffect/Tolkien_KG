Like his father he bore a [[Ring of Thrór|Ring of Power]].\n\n==History==\nLike all Durins after [[Durin|Durin I]] he was given the name of the first of the [[Seven Fathers of the Dwarves]] because he greatly resembled him in both appearance and manner. Indeed it was believed among the Dwarves that he was the reincarnation of Durin I, though whether this is possible is unclear.\n\n==Etymology==\nOne account states that the name ''Durin ''was a word for \"king\" in the language of the [[Men of the North]] in the early [[Second Age]].<ref name=relations>{{PM|Relations}}</ref> \n\nAnother account states that ''Durinn'' is one of the Dwarfs in the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. The name means \"Sleepy\".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, \"Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion\", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| DU1 | |DU1=[[Durin|Durin I]]<br /><small>''fl.

During his reign, the dragon Thorog took Helegrod, a northern city of his kingdom located near the source of the [[Bruinen]]. Durin took up the axe Mírdanant, a gift from the [[elves]] of [[Eregion]] to his ancestors, and led a small company of dwarves to reclaim the city. Durin and Thorog killed each other, and only one dwarf of his company survived to tell the story.\n\n:Helegrod was left abandoned by the dwarves. Mírdanant was said to be blessed by the elves with words of protection, and so the death of the king while bearing the axe and its loss in the abandoned city was a source of tension between Durin's Folk and the elves. A quest in the game involves reclaiming Mírdanant from the reanimated carcass of Thorog and returning it to the elves of [[Rivendell]], who in turn return it to [[Glóin]].\n\n{{references}}\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n| race=dwarf\n| house=[[Durin's Folk|House of Durin]]\n}}\n{{seq\n| pvac=Unknown\n| prev=Last known:<br/>[[Durin IV]]\n| prow=2\n| list=[[Kings of Durin's Folk|King of Durin's Folk]]\n| nvac=Unknown\n| next=Next known:<br/>[[Durin VI]] (mid-[[Third Age]])\n| nrow=2\n}}\n{{seq\n| list=[[Kings of Khazad-dûm|King of Khazad-dûm]]\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n\n{{durinskings}}\n[[Category:Dwarves]]\n[[Category:Dwarven names]]\n[[Category:Kings of Durin's Folk]]\n[[Category:Kings of Khazad-dûm]]\n[[Category:Longbeards]]\n[[Category:Norse names]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[de:Durin V.]]\n[[fi:Durin]]\n[[fr:encyclo:personnages:nains:3a:durin v]]"}}}
