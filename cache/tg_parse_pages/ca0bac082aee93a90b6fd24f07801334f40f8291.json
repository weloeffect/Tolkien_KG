The lake had a tiny island in the middle, which provided protection for [[Gollum]] from the nearby [[Goblin-town|Goblin camp]] and was where he lived for over four hundred years during the [[Third Age]]<ref name=Riddles>{{H|Riddles}}</ref> (Gollum entered the Misty Mountains about {{TA|2470}} and departed in {{TA|2944|n}}; how long it took him to find the lake is unknown).<ref name=AB>{{App|TA}}</ref> Gollum kept his few possessions on the island, including his [[One Ring|magic ring]]. The lake harboured [[fish]], which was the main food source of Gollum, who would paddle around in a small boat looking for them.<ref name=Riddles/>\n\nThe lake was at the end of a goblin-road, for the [[Goblins]] had discovered it years ago, and could continue their road no further. The goblins seldom ventured to the lake, sensing that something unpleasant lurked there, and those that did go to it did not always come back.<ref name=Riddles/> [[Bilbo]] stumbled upon the lake in {{TA|2941}},<ref name=AB/> having become lost and separated from [[Thorin and Company|his companions]]. It was beside this lake that he and Gollum played their [[riddle-game]].<ref name=Riddles/>\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Lakes]]\n[[Category:Misty Mountains]]\n[[de:Gollums See]]"}}}
