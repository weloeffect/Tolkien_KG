[[Uruks]] from [[Mordor]] appeared during the last years of his rule and attacked Ithilien and conquered Osgiliath in {{TA|2475}} so that the city was finally ruined and abandoned by its population, and its great stone-bridge over the river Anduin was broken. The borders of Gondor were under constant threat from his rule onwards.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}, entry for Steward Denethor I, p. 1053</ref>\n\nIt is also possible<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 546</ref> that it was built during the rule of Denethor II. This is less likely, as it already seemed to be partly ruinous and was under repair<ref>{{RK|MT}}, pp. 748-9</ref> on [[9 March]] {{TA|3019}}<ref name=Great>{{App|Great}}, p. 1093</ref> only 35 years after Denethor II became Steward of Gondor in {{TA|2984}}.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2984, p. 1090</ref> Additionally, Minas Tirith was falling more and more into decay and had only half of its original population in that year,<ref>{{RK|MT}}, p. 752</ref> which indicates a shortage of a labour force for the great labour that would be required to construct a thirty-mile long wall. Finally, Gondor had conquered back Osgiliath in the days of the youth of Denethor II to hold it as an outpost and to rebuild the bridge so that its troops could cross over the river,<ref>{{RK|MT}}, p. 764</ref> which would have been a risk for the Pelennor Fields if they had not been protected against raids by a wall at that time. [[Ghân-buri-ghân]], the chieftain of the [[Drúedain]] of [[Drúadan Forest]], referred to the Rammas Echor as the \"Stone-folk's new walls\",<ref name=Ride>{{RK|Ride}}, p. 834</ref> but it is not clear what age he considered \"new\" to mean and how far back the memory of his people reached.\n\nEarly in the morning on [[11 March]] {{TA|3019}}<ref name=Great/> Steward Denethor II at a meeting of his [[Council of Gondor|Council]] decided that the Rammas Echor and Osgiliath should be manned and defended against the enemy. His younger son [[Faramir]] volunteered to command the forces that defended Osgiliath and the Rammas Echor, knowing that they could cause the enemy to loose ten times their own losses during the attempt to cross the river Anduin, but that the long retreat of his forces from far out there would be dangerous if the enemy managed to cross the river.<ref name=Siege>{{RK|Siege}}, p. 817</ref>\n\nOn [[12 March]],<ref name=Great/> the attacking Morgul-host that was led by the Witch-king and outnumbered the defenders ten times managed to cross the Anduin on a large number of floats and barges that they had secretly built on the eastern side of Osgiliath so that Faramir retreated and rallied his men to the Causeway Forts.<ref name=Siege/>\n\nIn the early hours of [[13 March]],<ref name=Great/> the forces of [[Sauron]] blasted breaches in the Rammas Echor in many locations and wrecked the Causeway Forts. The defenders had to retreat over the Pelennor Fields to the Great Gate of Minas Tirith with Faramir leading the rearguard. When cavarly from [[Harad]] overtook the retreating men and caused them to rout, the entire remaining cavalry of Minas Tirith charged from the city, attacked the enemy forces and escorted the retreating men including Faramir, who had been shot with a dart during a fight with a mounted champion of Harad, back to the city. Only two thirds of the defenders including Faramir made it back to Minas Tirith.<ref>{{RK|Siege}}, pp. 818-20</ref>\n\nIn the evening of [[14 March]],<ref name=Great/> the riders of the [[Rohirrim]] led by their [[King of Rohan|King]] [[Théoden]] and guided by the Drúedain of Drúadan Forest reached the [[Grey Wood]]. Ghân-buri-ghân, the chieftain of the Drúedain, informed them that his scouts had seen no enemies between the Grey Wood and the Rammas Eachor and had seen that [[Orcs]] had made breaches in the Rammas Echor with explosives and that many Orcs were busy on the walls, but that they did not pay attention to their surroundings, because they seemed to think that the forces of Sauron watched all the approaching roads. Théoden's nephew [[Éomer]] was happy to hear those reports, because he had feared that the enemy could have defended the Rammas Echor for a long time if it had been intact.<ref name=Ride/>\n\nIn the early hours of [[15 March]],<ref name=Great/> the riders of the Rohirrim arrived at the northwestern gate of the Rammas Echor and found that the gate was ruined, that there was a great breach in the wall east of the gate and that only a few Orcs were left on the wall, which were busy destroying it and did not pay attention to the risk of enemies approaching from the north. The Rohirrim were able to surprise the Orcs and quickly killed them or drove them away and to use the ruined gate and the breach in the wall to ride into the Pelennor Fields.<ref>{{RK|Ride}}, p. 837</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Rammas Echor'' is a [[Sindarin]] name. It means \"great wall of the outer circle\".<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entry ''echor''</ref> It is a compound of ''[[rammas]]'' (\"great wall\") and ''[[echor]]'' (\"outer circle\").<ref name=UI/>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]:'''\n:The Rammas Echor does not appear, but it is mentioned by Théoden, who tells [[Grimbold]] to take his company right, \"after you pass the Wall.\"<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', \"[[The Ride of the Rohirrim (scene)|The Ride of the Rohirrim]]\"</ref>\n\n'''2004: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' (video game)]]:'''\n:The Southern Gate of the Rammas Echor is a mission in the Path of the King.
