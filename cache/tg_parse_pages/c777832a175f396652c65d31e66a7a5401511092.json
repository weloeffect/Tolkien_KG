The [[Evenstar]] falls from his grasp and shatters. At this he wakes to a soldier telling him [[Théoden]] is awaiting him. \n\nAragorn enters the king's tent, where he sees Théoden conversing with the hooded rider. Théoden leaves and the rider reveals himself to be [[Elrond]]. He brings Aragorn grim tidings, saying that Arwen is dying, and Aragorn is out outnumbered in the battle to come, citing the fleet of [[Corsair]] ships arriving to attack [[Minas Tirith]]. Elrond calls upon Aragorn to call upon \"[[Dead Men of Dunharrow|those who dwell in the mountain]]\" to fight for him. Elrond tells him they will answer to the [[King of Gondor]] and flourishes [[Andúril]] — [[Narsil]] reforged. Aragorn takes it from him and draws it. \"Put aside the [[Ranger]]. Become who you were born to be,\" Elrond says to Aragorn.\n{{blockquote|Ónen i-Estel Edain<br />(I give hope to Men)|[[Elrond]] to [[Aragorn]]}}\n<!--\n{{blockquote|Ú-chebin estel anim</br>(I keep none for myself)|[[Aragorn]] to [[Elrond]]}}\n-->\n\n==Differences==\nThe idea of Aragorn being given Andúril at this moment in the story is a large deviation from the source material. In the book, Aragorn was given the shards of Narsil by Elrond when he was twenty years of age,<ref name=\"App Tale\">{{App|Tale}}</ref>{{rp|1057}} and Andúril was forged from the shards before the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] departed [[Rivendell]].<ref>{{FR|South}}, pp. 276-7</ref> \n\nThe final words spoken between Elrond and Aragorn in this scene are the words spoken in the book by [[Gilraen]], the mother of Aragorn, to her son, at their final parting. She told Aragorn she was unable to face the coming darkness and would soon leave [[Middle-earth]]. After Aragorn tried to comfort her, she replied ''\"Ónen i-Estel Edain, ú-chebin estel anim (I gave Hope to the [[Dúnedain]], I have kept no hope for myself)\"''.<ref name=\"App Tale\"/>{{rp|1061}}\n{{references}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King scenes|30]]"}}}
