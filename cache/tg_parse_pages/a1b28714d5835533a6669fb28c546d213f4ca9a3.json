Tolkien]]'s [[The Hobbit]].\n\nThe series was adapted by Michael Kilgariff and produced by John Powell in eight half-hour mono episodes for BBC Radio 4.\n\n==Story==\nThe radio series follows the [[The Hobbit#synopsis|plot]] of the second edition very closely, except for the addition of The Tale Bearer, a narrator whose account of the story is often interrupted and embellished by the protagonist [[Bilbo Baggins]] in the role of secondary narrator.\n\nBilbo, a stay-at-home [[Hobbits|hobbit]], is approached by the [[wizard]] [[Gandalf]] to undertake a dangerous adventure, and despite his initial reluctance he soon finds himself accompanying [[Thorin]] and his party of [[dwarves]] on a long and difficult quest to recover the dwarves' treasure from [[Smaug]] the [[Dragons|dragon]], encountering [[trolls]], [[Orcs|goblins]], [[Gollum]] (acquiring a [[The One Ring|magic ring]] near Gollum's cave), [[wargs]], [[eagles]], giant [[spiders]], [[elves]] and [[men]] along the way. In the process Bilbo is transformed from a clumsy, timid and rather comic figure into a dignified and occasionally heroic everyman.\n\n===Episodes===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!Episode!!Air date\n|-\n|An Unexpected Party||[[29 September]], [[1968]]\n|-\n|Out of the Frying-pan into the Fire||[[6 October]], 1968\n|-\n|Riddles in the Dark||[[13 October|13 October]], 1968\n|-\n|Strange Lodgings||[[20 October]], 1968\n|-\n|Barrels out of Bond||[[27 October]], 1968\n|-\n|A Warm Welcome||[[3 November]], 1968\n|-\n|The Gathering of the Clouds||[[10 November]], 1968\n|-\n|The Clouds Burst||[[17 November]], 1968<ref>[http://www.britishdrama.org.uk/lotr.html J.R.R.

In the radio version this is changed to \"Great [[oliphaunts]]\", the form used in ''The Lord of the Rings''.\n*After killing the Great Goblin, Gandalf makes a light by saying the spell ''Naur an edraith ammen''.\n*At the beginning of the [[Battle of the Five Armies]] Gandalf says, \"Upon victory depends not just the treasure, nor only our lives, but the whole future and well-being of [[Middle-earth]]\". The name Middle-earth is not used at all in the original novel.\n*During the battle the Elvenking uses his name, [[Thranduil]], as a battle-cry.\n*In the same battle Thorin uses the dwarves' battle-cry, \"[[Baruk Khazâd! Khazâd ai-mênu!]]\"\n\n==Cast and credits==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!Actor!!Role\n|-\n|Peter Baldwin||[[Glóin]], [[Galion]]\n|-\n|[[David Brierly]]||[[Fíli]], [[Chief of the guards|Elf Guard]]\n|-\n|[[John Bryning]]||[[Master of Lake-town|The Master of Esgaroth]]\n|-\n|Wilfrid Carter||[[Ori]]\n|- \n|[[Heron Carvic]]||[[Gandalf]]\n|-\n|[[Paul Daneman]]||[[Bilbo Baggins]]\n|-\n|[[Nicholas Edmett]]||[[Kíli]]\n|-\n|[[Leonard Fenton]]||[[Thranduil|The Elvenking]]\n|-\n|[[Brian Haines]]||[[Bifur]], [[Bert]], [[Dáin Ironfoot]]\n|-\n|Betty Hardy||Spider\n|-\n|[[Denys Hawthorne]]||[[Beorn]]\n|-\n|[[Anthony Jackson]]||The Tale Bearer\n|-\n|[[Alexander John]]||[[Dori]], Elves, Goblins\n|-\n|[[John Justin]]||[[Thorin]]\n|-\n|Hilda Kriseman||Spider\n|-\n|Rolf Lefebvre||[[Óin]]\n|-\n|Victor Lucas||[[William|Bill]]\n|-\n|[[Denis McCarthy]]||[[Bofur]], [[Great Goblin]]\n|-\n|[[Duncan McIntyre]]||[[Bombur]], Elves, Goblins\n|-\n|[[Wolfe Morris]]||[[Gollum]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Pratt]]||[[Balin]]\n|-\n|John Pullen||[[Elrond]]\n|-\n|Ian Thompson||[[Herald of Esgaroth]]\n|-\n|Antony Viccars||[[Nori]]\n|-\n|[[Lockwood West]]||[[Dwalin]]\n|-\n|[[Marjorie Westbury]]||Spider, [[Thrushes|Thrush]]\n|-\n|Peter Williams||[[Bard]]\n|-\n|[[Francis de Wolff]]||[[Smaug]], [[Tom]]\n|-\n|[[John Wyse]]||[[Roäc]]\n|}\n\nThe music is composed by David Cain and performed by David Munrow with The Early Music Consort.\n\n==Production==\nThe show's production was complicated by the inclusion of multiple sound effects (often inserted live while recording the actors' performances), songs from the novel, and special sounds and electronic voice treatments created by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. All of the trolls, elves, goblins, wargs and eagles have treated voices, as does Gandalf when imitating the trolls.\n\n==Wiping and recovery==\nThe original master tapes for the series seem to have been wiped sometime during the 1970s. The reason is not clear, although it was rumoured to be due to a dispute with the Tolkien estate (if so, the subsequent recovery and commercial issue of the series proves that the dispute was resolved). \n\nThe BBC eventually recovered the series from a domestic off-air FM recording, apparently comprising 90- and 60-minute compilations edited together from the original episodes. The sound quality of these recordings is clear and legible, though it is noticeably inferior to a studio-quality recording and exhibits prominent tape hiss.\n\nFor broadcast and home audio purposes the BBC re-edited these compilations back into half-hour episodes, adding a brief snatch of the theme tune at the beginning and end of each. The title ''The Hobbit'' is spoken only at the beginning of the first episode and there are no opening or closing credits. It is quite likely that the credits were never included in the episodes themselves, but would originally have been read by a continuity announcer at the end of each episode.\n\n==Audio release and reference==\nThere have been several home audio releases of the series on cassette and CD. The [[1997]] CD release includes a bonus CD containing 9 minutes and 45 seconds of additional music in stereo, which evidently ''was'' taken from an unwiped master tape. The 1997 set also contains a \"Personal Memoir\" by series producer John Powell, from which some of the information in this article is derived.\n\nOn [[29 July|July 29]], [[2008]], an edition was published by BBC AudioBooks America; it includes interviews with [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].<ref>[http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/press/835-Tolkien_Audio_Books_2008.php Tolkien Audiobooks 2008], [[Pieter Collier|TolkienLibrary.com]]</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n{{title|italics}}\n[[Category:Radio adaptations]]\n[[de:The Hobbit (Hörspiel)]]"}}}
