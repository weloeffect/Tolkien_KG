It is described that [[Isildur]] began a grand plan to seal off Mordor and that the construction began before the end of {{TA|3019}} and was completed during the reign of [[Rómendacil I]] ({{TA|492}} - {{TA|541}}). It is mentioned that by {{TA|1640}} the last citadel guarding Mordor was abandoned. It is said that in the same year of the closing of the Dúnadan fortresses guarding Mordor Sauron sent all [[Ringwraiths]] except the [[Witch-king]] and [[Khamûl]] to lake [[Núrnen]] with the mission to ready Mordor for his return. It is described that they sent scouts north who found that the Gondorian fortresses were abandoned and that the Ringwraith Dwar of Waw occupied the Black Gate with Orcs, Trolls and mannish servants. It is further said that he repaired and changed the towers and the Black Gate in secret and that Gondor concerned with internal matters scarcely noted the activity. It is described that the Black Gate was destroyed in the cataclysm of Sauron's fall.\n\n'''[[2001]]-[[2003|03]]: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''\n:The Black Gate is present in the film series. in [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|the second film]] it appears as a double gate, operated by Trolls, where [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] attempt to go through the Gate until convinced by [[Gollum]] not to do so. In [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|the third film]] the Black Gate is a focal point of the [[Battle of the Morannon]], and after the destruction of [[the One Ring]] the Black Gate and the [[Towers of the Teeth]] are seen to collapse.\n\n'''[[2017]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Black Gate appears in the game as the location of a number of quests in the lead up to the defeat of [[Sauron]].\n{{references}}\n{{FellowshipRoute}}\n[[Category:Doors and gates]]\n[[Category:Fortresses]]\n[[Category:Mordor]]\n\n\n[[de:Morannon]]\n[[fi:Musta Portti]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/villes tours et forteresses/mordor/porte noire]]"}}}
