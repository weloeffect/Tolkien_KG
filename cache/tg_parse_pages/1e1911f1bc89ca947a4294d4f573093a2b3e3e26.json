It appears in their second full-length album, [[Sword's Song]], released in [[2003]].\n\n==Lyrics==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nScreaming and shouting, yearn for blood \nSevnts of Melkor the evil god \nRiding with wolves, runners of night \nHorders of the eye, the black blades of might \n\nThey shall raze your villages, destroy your camps \nRape your cattle and slaughter your wives \nUnder the darkness they shall arrive \nHear the screams, prepare for war \nBlack skin, sharp teeth, bestial eyes \nPerverted mind, there's no ine like their kind \nNo mercy, no prisoners, death is the way \nWith fire and steel they will slay \n\nTroops of the Red Eye, the horders of the Witch \nTrust your sword throught the heart of betrayals \nGreat enemy from west, the sevants of the sun \nKill for your lord, the darkest one \n\nMen of Gondor! Elves of Lothlorien! \nDwarves from the north now be strong! \nKeep your lines and hold on tight! \nPrepare your wapons and strike! \n\nLike a wave they approach \nBash their way through your lines \nMany of them \nEvil in flesh \nFeel no fear, just pray \n\nMockery of elves now our enemy \nBrothers of starfolk against us \nWhat kind of evil that they have seen \nCan't imagine the pain what they feel\n\n</poem>\n[[Category:Songs by Summoning]]"}}}
