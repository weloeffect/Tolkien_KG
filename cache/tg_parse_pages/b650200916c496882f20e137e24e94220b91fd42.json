These two races, identified individually as the [[Bree-hobbits]] (the [[Little Folk]]) and the [[Men of Bree|Bree-men]] (the [[Big Folk]]).<ref name=\"pony\">{{FR|I9}}</ref> \n\nTheir main settlements were four communities scattered around the [[Bree-hill]]: [[Bree]] itself, [[Staddle]], [[Combe]] and [[Archet]]. \n\n==History==\n\nThe Men who would eventually become them were among the first to come west during the [[Elder Days]]. They would evidently stay in the area, as when the Numenoreans returned to Middle-earth in the Second Age, they found the Bree-landers still present.<ref>{{FR|Sign}}, p. 195</ref>\n\nBree-hobbits similarly had an unclear origin, but tended to regard themselves as the oldest colony of hobbits in the world. They would settle in Staddle for the most part, though some would live in Bree proper as well. The two races of Hobbits and Men lived peacably with each other, but generally tended to mind their own business.<ref>{{FR|Sign}}, p. 196</ref>\n\nAfter the War of the Ring and the refounding of [[Arnor]], the Bree-landers became subjects of King [[Aragorn|Elessar]], who had once operated in the area under the name of Strider.<ref>{{RK|Homeward}}, p. 1301-1302</ref>\n\n==Culture==\nThey were a generally friendly folk, at least until the upheavals brought about by the [[War of the Ring]]. They had some dealings with the [[Shire-hobbits]], though the road between Bree and their 'colony' of the Shire was less traveled by the late [[Third Age]]. \n\nBree measured time with the [[Bree Calendar]]<ref>{{App|Calendars}}</ref> which is obviously a Hobbitish localization of the [[King's Reckoning]].<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Andreas Moehn]]|articlename=The Reckoning of Time|articleurl=http://lalaith.vpsurf.de/Tolkien/Time.html|website=Lalaith}}</ref>\n\nThey maintained their own dialect of [[Westron]].
