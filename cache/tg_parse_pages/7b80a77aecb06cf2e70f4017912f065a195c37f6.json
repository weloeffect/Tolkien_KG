Placed upon huge pedestals, each of the two figures held an axe in its right hand and its left hand rose in a gesture of defiance to the enemies of [[Gondor]].

Tolkien]] wrote in a [[Letter 211|letter]] that the [[Númenóreans]] of Gondor resembled Egyptians in many ways, including their love of, and ability to construct, the gigantic and massive, and in their interest in ancestry and tombs.<ref>{{L|211}}, p. 281</ref> [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] pointed out that the ''Argonath'' recall ancient Egyptian statues, like the [[Wikipedia:Colossi of Memnon|two gigantic statues of Memnon]] at the [[Wikipedia:Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III|Mortuary Temple of Amenophis III]].<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 347</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===The Argonath in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings (1978 film) - Argonath.png|[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring - Argonath.png|''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Argonath.jpg|''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''\n:The [[Fellowship of the Ring]] row past the Argonath.
