This is consistent with the location of the \"R\" in the label \"R Gilrain\" on [[The Third Map of The Lord of the Rings]], which was drawn by J.R.R. Tolkien during the writing of ''The Lord of the Rings'' based on which Christopher Tolkien drew the General Map of Middle-earth. The text of a revised version of the draft manuscript for the chapter ''[[The Last Debate]]'' explicitly states that Linhir and the fords were on the shore of the Gilrain, that the men of Lamedon defended the passage over the Gilrain at Linhir and that the enemy had sailed up the mouth of the Gilrain.<ref>{{WR|3|XII}}, \"to Linhir beside the waters of Gilrain where there are fords that lead into Lebennin\" and \"There the men of Lamedon had been contesting the passage of Gilrain with a great strength of the Haradrim, and of their allies the Shipmen of Umbar, who had sailed up Gilrainmouth\", pp. 411-2</ref><ref>[[Christopher Tolkien]], [[General Map of Middle-earth]] (published in older editions of [[The Lord of the Rings]]).</ref>\n\nFor the joint course of the Gilrain and the Serni from their confluence to the sea the name ''Linhir'' was also used.<ref>{{HM|UI}}, entry ''Linhir'', \"name of the joint course of Gilrain and Ringlo [i.e. Serni] bet[ween] their junction and the sea\", p. 587</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2014: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The river Gilrain formed the border between the areas of [[Dor-en-Ernil]] and Lower [[Lebennin]] in the region of Central [[Gondor]]. The river was the domain of the gentle River-maid Roamingstar, one of the Five Sisters, who dwelt in the mere. Roamingstar lulled the elf-maid [[Nimrodel]] to sleep with her song and so accidentally caused the Elf to lose her beloved, [[Amroth]], a tragedy the River-maid still felt guilt for during the [[War of the Ring]]. She and her sisters were widely considered myths by then, but when her aid was sought for Gondor she gave it by preventing the Ruthless Dead from crossing her river into Lebennin.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Gondor]]\n[[Category:Rivers]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n\n[[de:Gilrain]]\n[[fi:Gilrain]]"}}}
