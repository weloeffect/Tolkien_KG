Although Gelion was twice the length of Sirion after its junction with [[Ascar]], it was less wide and full, for more rain fell in the west than in the east.<ref name=\"Beleriand\">{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>\n\n==Course==\nIts two sources were at the hill of [[Himring]], via the [[Little Gelion]], and [[Mount Rerir]], via the [[Greater Gelion]] (which also had a tributary connected to [[Lake Helevorn]]). \n\nIt then flowed south for forty leagues, dividing [[Estolad]] to the west from [[Thargelion]] to the east. Gelion met [[Sarn Athrad]] (\"Ford of Stones\") just above the inflow of the River Ascar. Gelion then became the western border of [[Ossiriand]], the Land of Seven Rivers, from which it was fed by the rivers: [[Ascar]], [[Thalos]], [[Legolin]], [[Brilthor]], [[Duilwen]], and [[Adurant]], all rising in the [[Ered Luin]].<ref name=Beleriand/> South of the [[Falls of Gelion]], after Ascar met Gelion, that section of the river became swift and ever broader by the tributaries and thus was called '''Gabilān''' by the [[Dwarves of the Blue Mountains]] in [[Belegost]] and [[Nogrod]].<ref name=maeg/>\n\nAfter its junction with Adurant, Gelion turned southwest, passing by [[Taur-im-Duinath]] (the Forest between the Rivers) before emptying its waters into the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref> There were at least 300 leagues of total length between Gelion's source and its outfall into Belegaer.<ref name=Beleriand/>\n\n==History==\nThe [[Green-elves]] who dwelt in Ossiriand lived under the protection of the river, for after Sirion, [[Ulmo]] loved Gelion above all other waters of the western world.<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}</ref>{{rp|§115}}\n\nBetween the arms of Gelion lay the ward of [[Maglor]]. [[Caranthir]] made his abode at Lake Helevorn, and the land of Thargelion, which signified the Land beyond Gelion, was also called [[Dor Caranthir]], the Land of Caranthir.<ref name=\"Beleriand\"/>\n\nDue to the open nature of the land about the upper reaches of the River Gelion the region was subjected to many battles.  [[Haldad]] of the [[Haladin]] built a stockade in the corner formed by the Gelion and the Ascar when an orc-raid fell upon his people in Thargelion.<ref>{{S|West}}</ref> During the [[Dagor Bragollach]] the dragon [[Glaurung]] came and destroyed all the land between the arms of Gelion.<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> Eventually the lands between the rivers [[Aros]] and Gelion became so dangerous that [[Dwarves]] traveling to and from the Ered Luin and [[Menegroth]] stopped going in small parties but went in great companies well armed.<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n{{Pronounce|Gelion.mp3|Ardamir}}\nThe name ''Gelion'' is [[Sindarin]], but it is never glossed. In the [[Noldorin]] phase of the language, it is related with the [[Ilkorin]] word ''gelion'' (\"bright\"). However, it is noticeable that the same name is glossed as \"Merry Singer\", but applied to [[Tinfang]].<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry \"GYEL\"</ref>\n\n==Other names==\nIn [[Khuzdul]], it was known as '''''Gabilān'''''. The Dwarves used the name only of the river south of the [[Falls of Gelion]] where the river became swift and ever broader.<ref name=maeg>{{WJ|Maeglin}}, p. 336</ref>\n\nThe name contains the element ''[[gabil]]'' (\"great\"), that also appears in the Khuzdul name of [[Belegost]], ''[[Gabilgathol]]'' (\"Great Fortress\").\n\nIn a later text, [[Tolkien]] used the form '''''Gevolon''''', clearly a phonological development from the Dwarf-name ''Gabilān''.<ref>{{NM|P3ix}}, p. 311</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nIn later writings, Tolkien decided that the Gelion and [[Celon]] \"''river-names need revision to etymologizable words''\". Tolkien proposed many names: '''Gelduin''', '''Gevilon''', '''Gevelon''', '''Duin Daer''', and '''Duin Dhaer'''.<ref>{{WJ|III}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Ambarkanta maps|map V of ''Ambarkanta'']],<ref>{{SM|Ambar}} p.250-251</ref> developed by Tolkien during the 1930s, shows the mouth of the Gelion in the ocean. The river seems to flow (if we do not take into account a pentimento in the sketch) into an unnamed bay comparable in size to the [[Bay of Balar]].\n\n{{references}}\n{{ossiriandrivers}}\n[[Category:Noldorin locations]]\n[[Category:Pronounced articles]]\n[[Category:Rivers of Beleriand]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n\n[[de:Gelion]]\n[[fi:Gelion]]"}}}
