King [[Calimehtar (King of Gondor)|Calimehtar]] of [[Gondor]] defeated the [[Easterlings|Easterling]] army on the [[Dagorlad]], the site of the [[Battle of Dagorlad|legendary battle]] where Sauron was routed.\n\n==Prelude==\nAn Easterling people known as the [[Wainriders]] began attacking Gondor. [[Gondorians]] and [[Northmen]] who moved against them were defeated in the [[Battle of the Plains]] ({{TA|1856}}). Most Northmen lands were occupied by the Wainriders and were enslaved, however other escaped and some followed [[Marhwini]] to the [[Vales of Anduin]].\n\nYears later, the Wainriders planned to raid [[Calenardhon]] across the [[Undeeps]]. Lord Marhwini sent message to King Calimehtar warning him about this, notifying him also that the enslaved Northmen were also preparing a revolt should the Wainriders become involved in war. \n\nAs quickly as he could in {{TA|1899}} Calimehtar led an army north from [[Ithilien]]. He also secretly sent horsemen over the Undeeps.\n==The Battle==\nWhile moving his army, Calimehtar did what he could to make the enemies know of his movements in order to lure them. Indeed, gathering all of their available strength, the Wainriders came down to meet him and the King gave way before them, drawing them away from their homes, leaving the Undeeps unguarded.  \n\nThe two forces met on [[Dagorlad]] where battle developed. All seemed in doubt, until at the peak of the battle, upon the flank and rear of the Wainriders, fell Calimehtar's horsemen from the Undeeps, who were joined with a great ''[[éored]]'' led by Marhwini. The joint army drove the Wainriders back to the [[East]].\n==Revolt of the enslaved Northmen==\nDesperate Northmen who had become outlaws came out of [[Mirkwood]] and roused the Northmen who had been enslaved by the Wainriders to revolt against the families of the Wainriders who had stayed behind in their camps after their warriors had left to fight against the men of Gondor. They burned many of their enemies' dwellings, storehouses and fortified camps of wagons, but most of them died, because they were not well armed and because the youths, women and old men of the Wainriders defended their homes and their children. \n\nCalimehtar's and Marhwini's victory was overwhelming and Gondor enjoyed a respite from war for 45 years. Marhwini retired to his land beside the Anduin, and the Northmen of his race never again returned to their former homes.<ref name=\"Cirion\">{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Conflicts of the Third Age]]\n\n[[fr:encyclo:evenements:3a:guerres:bataille de dagorlad]]"}}}
