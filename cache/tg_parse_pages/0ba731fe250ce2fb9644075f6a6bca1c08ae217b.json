Each king governed the realm with the frame of ancient law, of which he was administrator (and interpreter) but not the maker.<ref name=\"politics\">{{L|244}}</ref> The line of the Kings would endure for over two thousand years, but would eventually fail with the presumed death of Eärnur. The kingship would be restored later by Aragorn, the hidden descendant of Elendil.\n\n==History==\nThe origins of the Kings of Gondor lie with the [[House of Elros]]. Through [[Amandil]] the Kings claimed descent from the [[Lords of Andúnië]], and from there to [[Silmariën]] and the [[King of Númenor|Kings of Númenor]]. The first line of the Kings of Gondor were primarily members of the [[House of Anárion]].\n\nElendil was the first King of [[Arnor]] and was succeeded by Isildur.  Elendil ruled over both realms as High King of the Dúnedain-in-exile Isildur succeeded as High King as well upon his father's death.  Isildur committed Gondor to the rule of Meneldil the son of Anarion as sole King of Gondor, but Isildur's royalty in the South-realm remained, as his line was by right High King over both [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]], though after Isildur's death, the realms were split. Isildur's son, [[Valandil]], opted to not press his claim as High King of the Realms-in-Exile. Thus were the two realms sundered from each other, though Isildur's line technically could still lay claim to the dormant High Kingship.\n\nThe kingship of Gondor, unlike Arnor which had a direct line from Isildur to [[Arvedui]], underwent several succession crises even before they eventually failed altogether. The first king of Gondor who had no direct offspring was [[Falastur]], who had to be succeeded by his nephew [[Eärnil I]]. The next childless king was [[Narmacil I]], who had to be succeeded by his brother [[Calmacil (King of Gondor)|Calmacil]]. The worst crisis, however, was that of the [[Kin-strife]], a civil war which resulted in both the loss of [[Umbar]] and the shedding of royal blood. From this war, [[Eldacar]] emerged victorious, but the House of Anárion was greatly weakened.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}p. 1371</ref> The house suffered further in the invasion of the [[Wainriders]], which killed the king [[Ondoher]] and his sons. Only his daughter [[Fíriel]] survived, who previously had married the king of [[Arthedain]], [[Arvedui]].\n\n[[Arvedui]] made an attempt to be named king of Gondor himself, citing two reasons. First, Isildur did not give up his being High King of both realms in exile, instead only committing the rule of Gondor to Meneldil, but not giving up his royalty. This meant that Isildur's heirs technically still held royalty within Gondor, even if they did not rule. Secondly, according to the Numenorian laws of succession, the sceptre would go the oldest child of the ruler upon their death, be they male or female. Thus, technically the kingship would have gone to Arvedui's wife Fíriel rather than a claimant from outside Ondoher's immediate family. However, the council of Gondor elected to ignore Arvedui's claims, and the kingship went instead to [[Eärnil II]], who was a member of the house of Anárion.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}p. 1374-1375</ref> After him, the crown lasted only one generation before the last of the kings.\n\nThe final king was Eärnur, who reigned for only seven years before he was challenged to single combat by the [[Witch-king of Angmar]]. Enraged by this, Eänur accepted the challenge and rode to [[Minas Morgul]], where he vanished and was never seen again. After his disappearance, however, there was no member close enough to the House of Anárion left in the realm of Gondor to make a claim to the kingship. Rather than suffer another civil war, the rule of the Kingdom of Gondor fell to a succession of [[Stewards of Gondor|Stewards]].<ref>{{App|Gondor}}p. 1379</ref>\n[[File:Rob Alexander - Return of the King.jpg|thumb|''Return of the King'' by [[Rob Alexander]]]]\nIn {{TA|3019}}, the kingship of Gondor was restored in the person of [[Aragorn]], who was the hidden descendant of Isildur. Aragorn was also a blood descendant of Anárion via the marriage of his ancestor [[Arvedui]] to the Gondorian princess [[Fíriel]]. Aragorn, taking the regnal name Elessar, reestablished the kingship of Gondor before going on to refound the realm of [[Arnor]] as well, thus recreating the [[Reunited Kingdom]]. Elessar's new royal house would henceforth be known as the [[House of Telcontar]]. Elessar would rule until {{FoA|120}}, before passing the rule of the kingdom to his son [[Eldarion]].\n\n==Duties and office==\nThe King was the ultimate commander of the armies and navies of Gondor. For example, King Eärnil II sent his son Eärnur as the leader of the army who defeated the [[Witch-king of Angmar]]. The King would also be in charge of building projects, such as creating fortifications.<ref>{{App|A1iv}}</ref> The King served as the ultimate arbiter of justice in court matters.<ref>{{RK|VI5}}</ref> The King would have the ability to forge diplomatic alliances and both administer and renew oaths.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref> The King was the only one invested with the ability to invoke the name of [[Eru]], though this power was seldom used.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref> Finally, the King had the legal right of using the [[palantíri]] available to him in places such as [[Minas Ithil]]. He could also invest others to do this on his behalf if the situation required it.<ref>{{UT|Palantiri}}</ref> However, this practice ended when [[Sauron]] gained control of the [[Ithil-stone]], for fear that he might work evil with it.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref>\n\nThe King appointed a Steward who would help in both the running of the King's affairs and ruling in the King's stead if he was incapacitated or otherwise away from the kingdom.<ref>{{UT|8e}}This was first done by Rómendicil I, see note 53</ref> There was also a [[Council of Gondor]] who advise the King, though the full extent of the council's powers remains unclear. The Council retained enough authority to block the attempt of Arvedui, last king of Arthedain, to be named King of Gondor, even though he technically met the requirements. Earnil would be named in his stead.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>\n\nPart of the tradition associated with the King was that he was the only one who knew the location of the [[Tomb of Elendil]]. This burial ground was used as a place of secrecy or meditation by the Kings, and they were sworn not to let the location of it be known. It would remain secret until the days of the Stewards.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>\n\nThe kings of Gondor had a crown used as a badge of office. They also would set in a great throne in the White Tower, a tradition respected even during the time of the Ruling Stewards, who did not sit on the King's throne.\n\n==List of Kings==\n[[Elendil]], son of [[Amandil]], reigned titularly as [[High King of the Dúnedain|High King]] from {{SA|3320}} – {{SA|3441|n}} while his sons [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]] were the co-rulers of Gondor itself until Anárion's death in {{SA|3440}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|- style=\"background: var(--tg-color-surface-2);\" \n!
