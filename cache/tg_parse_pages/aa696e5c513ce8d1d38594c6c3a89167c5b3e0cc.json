His father began with a penciled draft in which the hobbits awake next to the standing stone and ride down into the fog.  A version in ink repeats this draft, adding the description of the northward view to the dark line in the distance.  This inked draft ends with a penciled plot-outline that descends into illegibility. Christopher then presents the plot-outline since it reveals his father's intentions up to [[Rivendell]].\n \n[[Tom Bombadil]] sings and awakens the hobbits. Tom blesses or curses the gold from the mound and lays it upon the ground.  Tom leads them to the [[East Road]] and departs.  The hobbits reach the [[Prancing Pony|inn]] and hear news of [[Gandalf]].  [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] notes that the rest of the journey is to be told rapidly. The hobbits visit [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo's]] trolls, which delays them.  Approaching the [[Ford of Bruinen]] the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] chase them.  The hobbits make it across the ford but the Riders are right behind. As they enter the water the river floods and the Riders draw back just in time.  The hobbits ride on quickly to Rivendell.  There they find Bilbo and Gandalf and a consultation with [[Elrond]] is held. The outline ends with a title: \"The Quest of the Fiery Mountain\".\n \nAs Christopher notes in comments, at this point [[Aragorn|Strider]] does not exist and [[Weathertop]] is not present.  The title at the end is the first mention of the goal of the adventure.\n \nWhen the full manuscript of this chapter was written it was very largely in the final form that became Book I, Chapter 8: \"[[Fog on the Barrow-downs]]\". Instead of repeating the whole chapter, Christopher shows what was different before the published version: After the hobbits become separated in the fog and Bingo<ref group=\"note\">Bingo would later be renamed Frodo.</ref> cried out \"Where are you?\" the other hobbits responded \"Here! Here!\", and the party is reunited. Tolkien quickly rejected this section and substituted, \"There was no reply\". The first version of the incantation in the barrow was replaced.  There is originally no mention of the history of the swords that Tom chooses for the hobbits to wear; a later penciled-in note states that men out of the west from long ago, foes of the Ring-lord, made them. Tom Bombadil guesses that the Riders were now seeking the hobbits among the barrows so it would be safe for them to go on to [[Bree]]. As for the inn (first the \"White Horse\" with \"Prancing Pony\" written above), Tom tells them that the keeper was a good man and \"Just you mention my name and he will treat you fairly\". The innkeeper is named Barnabas Butterbur instead of Barliman.<ref>{{RS|Wight}}</ref>\n \n{{references|note}}\n[[Category:The Return of the Shadow chapters]]"}}}
