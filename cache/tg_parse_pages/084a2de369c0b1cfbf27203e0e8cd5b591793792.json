This wall blocked the entrance to a deep valley, later called by the Rohirrim [[Helm's Deep]], south-east of the northern end of the [[White Mountains]], below the peaks known as the [[Thrihyrne]].<ref name=Deep>{{TT|Deep}}, p. 528.</ref> It guarded the southern end of the [[Gap of Rohan]].<ref name=Aglarond>{{UT|11c}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe fortress was built by [[Gondorians]], at a date not known to the Rohirrim, who said that it was constructed in \"far-off days of the glory of Gondor [by] the sea-kings ... with the hands of giants\".<ref name=Deep/> It was originally called [[Aglarond]],<ref name=Aglarond/><ref>{{TT|Palantir}}, \"That way lies Aglarond and the Glittering caves.\", p. 599</ref> a name used also for the caves located at the head of the valley.<ref name=Road>{{TT|Road}}, p. 548</ref>\n\nIn later years whole regions of Gondor, including [[Calenardhon]], were depopulated or evacuated. Steward [[Cirion]] gave the province to the [[Rohirrim]] as a reward for their assistance at the [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant]] in {{TA|2510}}. Masons of Gondor helped to repair the fortress of Aglarond. After that it was handed over to the Rohirrim and the old hereditary Gondorian guards of Aglarond were stationed at the fortress of [[Isengard|Angrenost]] (called ''Isengard'' by the Rohirrim).<ref name=Aglarond/> The Rohirrim called the fortress of Aglarond the ''Súthburg'',<ref name=Fords>{{UT|11c}}, footnote after the sentence starting with \"The fortress there was repaired\" in the third paragraph of the long note</ref> probably because it guarded the southern end of the [[Gap of Rohan]], as Isengard guarded the northern end.\n\nWhen [[Wulf]] and the [[Dunlendings]] overran Rohan, [[Helm|Helm Hammerhand]], ninth King of Rohan, sought refuge in the fortress during the [[Long Winter]] of {{TA|2759}} where he was besieged. The fortress was called the ''Hornburg'' after the days of King Helm,<ref name=Fords/> because of Helm's great horn,<ref>{{HM|N}}, entry '''Hornburg, Hornrock''', p. 772</ref> which he had blown before his lone raids into the camp of the enemies during the siege<ref>{{App|Eorl}}, entry for king Helm Hammerhand, p. 1066</ref> and because a horn sounded from its tower echoed in the Deep behind.<ref name=Deep/>\n\nDuring the period [[Battles of the Fords of Isen]] leading up to the [[War of the Ring]], [[Erkenbrand]], the Lord of Deeping-coomb and of much other land in Westfold,<ref>{{UT|11b}}, fourth pargraph</ref> resided at the Hornburg.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, fourteenth paragraph</ref>  \n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Hornburg.jpg|thumb|left|Hornburg in ''The Lord of the Rings Online'']]\n\n==Other names==\nThe name ''Aglarond'' was used for the caves and for the fortress at the entrance to Helm’s Deep.<ref>{{UT|Index}}, entry ''Aglarond''</ref> ''Aglarond'' is a [[Sindarin]] name, which is translated as \"Glittering Caves\"<ref name=Road/> or \"Caves of Radiance.<ref name=Fords/> It contains the elements ''[[aglar]]'' (\"brilliance\",<ref name=N>{{HM|N}}, note removed by J.R.R Tolkien from the Nomenclature, pp. 421 and 751</ref> \"radiance\", glory\"<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, entry S '''aglar''', p. 24</ref>) and ''[[rond]]'' (\"vault\", \"high roofed cavern\"),<ref name=N/><ref>{{L|211}}</ref> Since the word ''aglar'' is derived from the stem KAL- (\"light\")<ref name=PE17/>\"Glittering Caves\" can be the exact translation.\n\nThe Rohirrim called the caves of Aglarond ''Glǽmscrafu''<ref group=\"note\">The ''sc'' in Glǽmscrafu is pronounced as ''sh''.</ref> (‘Caves of Radiance’<ref>{{UT|Index}}, entry ''Glǽmscrafu''</ref>) and the fortress itself ''Súthburg'' (\"South Fortress\")<ref name=BT1>{{webcite|website=[http://www.bosworthtoller.com/ Bosworth-Toller Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]|articleurl=https://bosworthtoller.com/29435|articlename=súþ|accessed=30 October 2023}}</ref><ref name=BT2>{{webcite|website=[http://www.bosworthtoller.com/ Bosworth-Toller Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]|articleurl=https://bosworthtoller.com/41108|articlename=burg|accessed=30 October 2023}}</ref>).<ref name=Fords/> Both ''Glǽmscrafu''<ref name=Fords/> and ''Súthburg''<ref name=BT1/><ref name=BT2/> are [[Old English]] names.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n\n'''2013: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n: Hornburg was added with the ''Helm's Deep'' expansion in 2013.
