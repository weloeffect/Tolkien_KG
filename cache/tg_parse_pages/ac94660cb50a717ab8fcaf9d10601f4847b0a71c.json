Tolkien]]'s full set of manuscripts of the time-scheme, or \"Chronology\", that underlies the planning of ''The Lord of the Rings''. There are multiple versions of the time-schemes, the final version contains 14 pages. It is this version that is fully transcribed, and provided with extensive notes in the article. Hicklin also provided an introduction and an in-depth commentary that traces the evolution of the Chronology.\n\nSome excerpts from the Chronology have been quoted in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'' (2005). Photocopies of the Chronology's final-version manuscripts were afterwards published in ''[[The Art of the Manuscript]]'' (2022). But many of the draft-version manuscripts are presented exclusively in this work.\n\n==Manuscript pages==\nIn the final-version Chronology, 9 out of 14 pages are in grids, 5 are linear.\n<br>The time period covered in each page is as follows:\n\n<div style=\"-moz-column-width: 400px; -webkit-column-width: 400px; column-width: 400px; -moz-column-gap: 15px; -webkit-column-gap: 15px; column-gap: 15px; -webkit-column-rule: 1px solid #cccccc; -moz-column-rule: 1px solid #cccccc; column-rule: 1px solid #cccccc;\">\n* page 1: [[22 September]], {{SR|1418}} - [[15 October]]\n\n* page 2: [[16 October]] - [[15 January]], {{SR|1419}}\n\n* page 3: [[15 January]] - [[22 January]]\n\n* page 4: [[23 January]] - [[16 February]]\n\n* page 5: [[17 February]] - [[25 February]]\n\n* page 6: [[26 February]] - [[29 February]]\n\n* page 7: [[30 February]] - [[3 March]]\n\n* page 8: [[4 March]] - [[7 March]]\n\n* page 9: [[8 March]] - [[12 March]]\n\n* page 10: [[13 March]] - [[17 March]]\n\n* page 11: [[18 March]] - [[25 March]]\n\n* page 12: [[8 August]] - [[10 August]]\n\n* page 13: [[14 August]] - [[22 September]]\n\n* page 14: [[5 October]] - [[6 October]], {{SR|1421}}</div>\n\n==New information==\n[[File:Chronology of The Lord of the Rings page 13.jpeg|thumb|225px|Page 13 of the Chronology]]\nThe Chronology provides new insights that do not appear in the published books. For example, concerning the fate of [[Shagrat]], Orc Captain of the Tower of Cirith Ungol, it is stated that on Saturday March 17,\n\n:\"''Shagrat brings the mithril coat and other spoils to Barad-dȗr; but is slain by Sauron''\".\n\nAnother hidden fact shows that, while the Fellowship is resting in Lothlórien on Tuesday, January 24, [[Gollum]] lurks on the borders of that country; and there he is captured by [[Uglúk]] and the Isengarders. The Chronology entry reads under the heading Gollum: \n\n:\"''Gollum captured by Uglúk, but escapes after revealing that Hobbits of Shire were with Gandalf, and enough is said to make Uglúk certain that Ring was with the Company''\".\n\nWhile under the heading of Enemies it reads:\n\n:\"''Isengarders capture Gollum, and torment him for news. Uglúk sends news to Isengard of Hobbits; but not of the Ring''\".<ref name=\"W.F.\">{{webcite|author=Fliss, William M.

Our grateful thanks go to Mr. Hicklin for giving us the opportunity to add to the mosaic of Middle-earth this essential and heretofore missing piece. It is a look behind the scenes at the painstaking planning that went into one of the most salient features of Tolkien’s great work: that back-and-forth switching among interconnecting narratives which Richard C. West called its “interlace” structure. The word describes a medieval narrative device meant to mirror “the flux of events . . . where everything is happening at once” (West 79). Such attention to detail gives reality to a world, especially a fantastical sub-created one that has to command belief instead of relying on it.}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/20/article/861624 The Chronology of The Lord of the Rings] on Project Muse\n* [https://tolkiengateway.net/w/images/2/2c/Chronology_Errata.pdf Errata] to the ''Chronology''\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/tolkienfans/comments/wwl40m/tolkiens_chronology_of_the_lord_of_the_rings_ask/ \"Ask me Anything\" with Bill Hicklin] on Reddit\n\n{{references}}\n{{title|italics}}\n{{Publishedmajorbooks}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chronology of The Lord of the Rings, The}}\n[[Category:Books by J.R.R.
