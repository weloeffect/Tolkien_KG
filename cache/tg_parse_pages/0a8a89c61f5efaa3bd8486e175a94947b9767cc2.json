[[Fëanor]] expresses anger, but has no regret and doesn't stray from his goal to win the [[Silmarils]] back.\n==Lyrics==\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\"Taken the long way\nDark realms I went through\nI arrived, my vision's so clear\nIn anger and pain\nI left deep wounds behind\nBut I arrived\nTruth might be changed by victory\n\nBeyond the void but deep within me\nA swamp of filth exists\nA lake it was of crystal beauty\nBut Arda's spring went by\nI've heard the warning\nWell, curse my name!\nI'll keep on laughing\nNo regret, no regret\n\nDon't fear the eyes of the dark lord\nMorgoth, I cried\nAll hope is gone but I swear revenge\nHear my oath\nI will take part in your damned fate\n\nI, I will always remember their cries\nLike a shadow which covers the light\nI will always remember the time\nBut it's past\nI cannot turn back the time\nDon't look back\nThere's still smoke near the shore\nBut I arrived\nRevenge be mine\n\nI will take part in your damned fate\nMorgoth, I cried\nIt's my oath!\nSo don't fear the eyes of the dark lord\nRun!\n\nSuddenly I realized\nThe prophecies I never believed in (set your spirit free)\nMy deeds were wrong\nI've stained the land and slain my kin (burning soul)\nNo release from my sins\nIt hurts (the curse of Fëanor runs on)\nTime and only time will tell us\nTell, was I right or wrong?\nWhen anger breaks through\nI'll leave mercy behind (behind\n\nI will take part in your damned fate\nMorgoth, I cried\nIt's my oath\nSo don't fear the eyes of the dark lord\n\nI, I will always remember their cries\nLike a shadow they'll cover my life\nBut I'll also remember mine\nAfter all I'm still alive (still alive)\nI'm still alive (still alive)\n\nMorgoth, I cried\nAll hope is gone but I swear revenge\nHear my oath\nI will take part in your damned fate\"\n</poem>\n[[Category:Songs by Blind Guardian]]"}}}
