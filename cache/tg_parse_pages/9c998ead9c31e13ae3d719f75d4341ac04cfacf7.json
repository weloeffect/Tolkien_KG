The final size of the map is estimated at around 2,300 square kilometres (~890 square miles), making it the largest re-creation of Middle-earth ever attempted, outside of works relying on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation procedural generation].\n\n==Conception==\n[[File:ArdaCraft Rivendell.jpg|thumb|[[Rivendell]] was completed in 2018|left]]\nThe project was founded by players Fornad and dags, who believed that they could use Minecraft to re-create Middle-earth in the late Third Age in a larger and more accurate way than had ever been attempted before in any video game. Given its popularity and shallow learning curve, Minecraft was a good medium in which to work. However, the limitations of the game led ArdaCraft towards a modded approach, where it was able to use more textures and models than were available in the normal game. Eventually it adopted the [http://conquestreforged.com/ Conquest Reforged mod] in order to do this.\n\nThe project is run by volunteers and funded by donations, and is an entirely non-profit endeavour.\n\n==Approach==\n[[File:ArdaCraft Hobbiton.png|thumb|ArdaCraft's [[Hobbiton]] drew heavily upon Tolkien's watercolour]]\nDespite being built in the blocky environment of Minecraft, ArdaCraft focuses on geological, botanical, and historical research in order to make its world as believable as possible. This includes researching historical farming techniques, understanding the likely climate of various areas in order to predict the kinds of plant species which should occur there, and examining analagous historical cultures for various regions - for example, Iron Age Celts for [[Dunland]], the Anglo-Saxons for [[Rohan]], or various ancient Mediterranean cultures (particularly the Eastern Roman Empire) for [[Gondor]]. \n\nIn addition, a heavy emphasis is placed upon lore accuracy. Tolkien's legendarium, letters and sketches are all analysed to create as good of a representation of his world as possible, given the constraints of the game.\n\nOther details are added to the world to help explorers feel more immersed. For instance, the project has its own soundtrack, composed by volunteers. The sun angle changes in the sky as the player gets further south, corresponding to the lines of latitude indicated by Tolkien. Real-world constellations that are below the horizon in the north are revealed in the south.\n\n==Progress==\n[[File:Middle-earth DEM (ArdaCraft).png|left|thumb|ArdaCraft's Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of Middle-earth is the most detailed ever made]]\nAs of August 2024, regions and locations which have been completed or are being worked on include [[The Shire]], The [[Blue Mountains]], [[Lindon]], [[Bree-land]], [[Arnor]], the [[Angle]], [[Forochel]], [[Rivendell]], the [[Vales of Anduin]], [[Lothlórien]], [[Isengard]], [[Emyn Muil]], [[Rohan]], [[Dunland]], [[Tharbad]], [[Moria]], and [[Gondor]]. Regions such as [[Mirkwood]] and [[Erebor]] are planned for the future.\n\nThey have also created the most detailed heightmap of Middle-earth ever made during the course of their work, which is in the early stages of being used for the [[Digital Tolkien Project]]. It aims for accuracy with the texts above all else, with the various - often contradictory - maps of Middle-earth published by J.R.R. Tolkien and [[Christopher Tolkien]] acting as a secondary source. As it is a three-dimensional map, the sightlines described in the text have also been taken into account to ensure complete accuracy.\n\nArdaCraft's founder presented the project's work to the [[The Tolkien Society|Tolkien Society]] at [[Oxonmoot]] 2024, and in 2025 the project was nominated for the [[The Tolkien Society Awards|Tolkien Society Award]] for Best Online Content.<ref>{{Cite web|articleurl=https://www.tolkiensociety.org/2025/04/vote-now-in-tolkien-society-awards-2025/|articlename=Vote Now in Tolkien Society Awards 2025|author=Jeremy Edmonds|dated=15 April 2025|accessed=16 May 2025}}</ref>\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Games|Games]]\n\n==External links==\n*[https://ardacraft.me/ Official website]\n*[http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoqngW24Nl6yS-u99vE4E1Q YouTube channel]\n*[https://www.instagram.com/ardacraft/ Instagram]\n\n{{References}}\n{{Videogames}}\n[[Category:Microsoft Windows games]]\n[[Category:Modifications]]\n[[Category:Open world games]]"}}}
