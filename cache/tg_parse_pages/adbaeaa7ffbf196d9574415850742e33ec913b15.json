Tolkien]], in which he offers a criticism of [[Wikipedia:Edward Plunkett, 18th Baron of Dunsany|Lord Dunsany]]'s story \"Distressing Tale of Thangobrind the Jeweler\". The manuscript was found in Tolkien's copy of the fantasy anthology ''[[Swords & Sorcery]]'' (which included the story), a gift from [[L. Sprague de Camp]] (who wrote the introduction of the book). According to sales of the item, Tolkien's text is \"not [a] very complementary critique\".<ref>[http://www.tolkienbookshelf.com/si/000971.html# ID:000971] at [http://www.tolkienbookshelf.com TolkienBookshelf.com] (accessed 19 September 2011)</ref><ref>[http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/dmiller/000333.htm A Signed Book...] at [http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/ TolkienLibrary.com] (accessed 19 September 2011)</ref>\n==Excerpts==\n<poem>\nJirel of Joiry.
