This was before [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] conceived the [[Ents]] of ''[[The Two Towers]]'' and the adjective \"entish\" directly refers to Old English ''eōten'' \"giant\"<ref>{{RS|1XId}}</ref> (see also [[#Etymology|Etymology]] section).\n\nLater Tolkien decided to change it into \"Trollfells\" (capitalized without a hyphen): he wrote on a map: \"Alter Entish Lands to [Trollfells > Bergrisland >] Ettenmoor\". This is also the first mention of Ettenmoor(s) in the legendarium.<ref>{{TI|Map}}, p. 306</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nThe name ''Ettenmoors'' is similar to the land of [http://narnia.wikia.com/wiki/Ettinsmoor Ettinsmoor] of [[The Chronicles of Narnia|Narnia]] by [[C.S. Lewis]]. In ''The Silver Chair'' Lewis mentions that it is inhabited by [http://narnia.wikia.com/wiki/Ettin Ettins], giants who often play the game of Cockshies, throwing rocks at a gorge, much like the [[giants|stone giants]] in ''[[The Hobbit]]''.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===The Ettenmoors in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nRob Alexander - Ettenmoors.jpg|Ettenmoors in ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]''\nGail McIntosh - Ettenmoors.jpg|Ettenmoors in ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]''\nThe Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring - The Ettenmoors.png|The Ettenmoors in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''\nEttenmoors map LOTRO.jpg|Map of the Ettenmoors from ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''\n:A [https://www.ccgtrader.net/card/5976/ettenmoors card] from ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'' identifies one of locations in which [[Arwen]] evaded the [[Nazgûl]] as the Ettenmoors.\n\n'''2002-5: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game]]'':'''\n:The Ettenmoors are the homeland of the ''[[Etten]]s'' who resemble [[Hill-trolls]], but they possess \"not one but two long heads\".<ref>{{D|Fell}}</ref>\n\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Ettenmoors is the region where Player vs Monster Player play takes place, pitting the \"Army of [[Angmar]]\" against the \"Coldfells Army\" of the [[Free Peoples]].
