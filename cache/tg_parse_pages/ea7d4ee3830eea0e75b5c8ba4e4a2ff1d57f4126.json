As the [[Doors of Durin]] won’t open, they resort to using blasting fire to break their way into Moria. The floor then caves in and the protagonist is trapped, finding shadow runes sealing the doors shut from the inside. The protagonist is then left with the task of making their way to the other side of Moria and the east gate as an escape.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe gameplay is standard of a survival-crafting video game. The game encompasses systems such as mining, crafting, smelting etc in order for the player to progress. The games progression follows various areas or ‘deeps’ in which certain resources and enemies are found and must be collected/defeated to progress to the next area. The player can also find orc camps in which to attack and loot, and raids are common. The combat includes swords, shields, armour and more to emulate the dwarven combat style. Fast travel mechanics and spawn point systems are implemented into the game for quality of life. \n\n==Reception==\n''The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria'' was first revealed along with a short cinematic trailer on June 10, 2022, at the 2022 Epic Games Summer Showcase. The game was originally planned to be released in spring 2023 and was eventually released on October 24, 2023 for Microsoft Windows, with the PlayStation 5 release following on December 5, 2023. The Xbox Series X/S release was scheduled for early 2024.<ref>[https://www.gematsu.com/2023/10/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-for-ps5-delayed-to-december-5-pc-version-goes-gold The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria for PS5 delayed to December 5; PC version goes gold]</ref> The Windows version was initially sold exclusively on the Epic Games Store, but was later released on Steam on August 27, 2024. \n\nThe game has received generally mixed reviews, with it getting a 4/10 from IGN, a 3/5 from Eurogamer and a 59% on Metacritic. User reviews on the game vary depending on general taste. The game is criticised for its poor linear progression, lack of balancing and a clear deviation from a lot of Tolkiens work. The most obvious story deviation is the organisation and number of orc camps and bosses, despite the destruction of the [[The One Ring|Ring]] and [[Sauron]] at the end of the previous age.\n\n{{references}}\n{{videogames}}\n{{title|italics}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lord of the Rings Return to Moria}}\n[[Category:Action games]]\n[[Category:Microsoft Windows games]]"}}}
