There she bred such horrors that the valley was given the name ''Nan Dungortheb''. After she had departed the land was infested with [[Spiders|her offspring]].<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref>  Waters that spilled into the valley from the Ered Gorgoroth were defiled, filling the hearts of those that drank of them with madness and despair. All living things other than the spiders avoided the valley, including the [[Noldor]] who would only cross it by paths nearest to Doriath.<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Aredhel]], daughter of [[Fingolfin]], attempted to ride eastward across Nan Dungortheb, her party was separated by the shadows. While she succeeded in reaching [[Himlad]], her companions could not find her and were chased away by spiders. Returning to [[Gondolin]], they reported her as lost to [[Turgon]].<ref>{{S|Maeglin}}</ref>\n\n[[Beren]], sorely pressed by the forces of [[Morgoth]] who sought for him in [[Dorthonion]], passed over the Ered Gorgoroth and crossed Nan Dungortheb from north to south. He never spoke of his journey through this land lest the horror of it return to his mind.<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name ''Nan Dungortheb'' is translated as \"Valley of Dreadful Death\",<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> containing the word ''nan'' (\"valley\"), and ''gor'' (\"horror\")<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entry ''nan(d)''</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\n=== The Book of Lost Tales ===\nIn ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' the glade that would afterward be known as '''''Nan Dumgorthin''''' (\"the land of the dark idols\") was in the northward region of [[Artanor]] (Doriath) and was a dark land, with dread wandering beneath its lowering trees no less even than in [[Tuarfuin]] (Taur-nu-Fuin).<ref name=Tinúviel>{{LT2|I}}</ref>{{rp|48}} In ''[[The Tale of Tinúviel]]'', it was here that [[Huan]] came upon, and rescued, [[Beren]] and [[Tinúviel]] as they were fleeing from the pursuit of [[Melko|Melko's]] [[Orcs]] after retrieving a [[Silmaril]] and Beren had his hand bitten off by [[Karkaras]].<ref name=Tinúviel/>{{rp|48}}\n\nThe [[Gnomish Lexicon]] defined '''Dumgorthin''' as \"a land of dark forests, East of ''Artanor'', where, on a wooded mountain, were hidden idols sacrificed to by some evil tribe of renegade men\". '''Dum''' meaning \"secret, not to be spoken, especially of bad things\" and '''Dungort, dumgort''' as \"an (evil) idol\".<ref>{{PE|11}}</ref>{{rp|31}}\n\n=== The Lays of Beleriand ===\nIn the ''[[Lay of the Children of Húrin]]'', [[Túrin]] and [[Gwindor|Flinding]] came upon '''''Nan Dungorthin''''' in the dim twilight after the accidental murder of [[Beleg]]. It is described as such:<ref>{{LB|1d}}, lines 1472-1490</ref>\n<poem>\nThus reached they the roots   and the ruinous feet\nof those hoary hills   that Hithlum girdle,\nthe shaggy pinewoods   of the Shadowy Mountains.\nThere the twain enfolded   phantom twilight\nand dim mazes   dark, unholy,\nin Nan Dungorthin   where nameless gods\nhave shrouded shrines   in shadows secret,\nmore old than Morgoth   or the ancient lords\nthe golden Gods   of the guarded West.\nBut the ghostly dwellers   of that grey valley\nhindered nor hurt them,   and they held their course\nwith creeping flesh   and quaking limb.\nYet laughter at whiles   with lingering echo,\nas distant mockery   of demon voices\nthere harsh and hollow   in the hushed twilight\nFlinding fancied,   fell, unwholesome\nas that leering laughter   lost and dreadful\nthat rang in the rocks   in the ruthless hour\nof Beleg’s slaughter.   ‘Tis Bauglir’s voice\nthat dogs us darkly   with deadly scorn’\n</poem>\n\nIn the ''[[Unwritten Cantos]]'', similar to the ''Tale of Tinúviel'', a consideration was for Beren and [[Lúthien]] to be \"become lost and bewildered in the dreads of Nan Dungorthin\", but now \"hunted by phantoms, and snared at last by the great spiders.\" They would still be rescued by Huan, who would proceed to guide them down Sirion.<ref>{{LB|3U}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Taur-nu-Fuin]]: another dark forest, closely located to Nan Dungortheb, which took some of the early legendarium elements from Nan Dungortheb.\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Beleriand]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[Category:Valleys]]\n\n[[de:Nan Dungortheb]]\n[[fi:Nan Dungortheb]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/regions/beleriand/nan dungortheb]]"}}}
