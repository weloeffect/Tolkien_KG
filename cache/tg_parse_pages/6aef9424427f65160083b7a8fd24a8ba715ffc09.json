Its course flowed north down [[Harrowdale]] past the courts of [[Edoras]] then, after a sharp bend, east to meet the [[Entwash]] among the grassy plains of [[Eastfold]].<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref>\n\nThe deep valley above Edoras was called Harrowdale and between its walls the Snowbourn loudly rushed over stones. It was fed by a lesser stream from the west that had cascaded near a mountain path. After making its right turn just beyond Edoras it flowed twelve leagues to its confluence with the [[Entwash]], which was in willow-thickets.<ref name=\"Muster\">{{RK|Muster}}</ref>\n\nThe Snowbourn served as the border between the [[Westfold]] and the [[Eastfold]]. It was also, in conjunction with the [[Entwash]] north of their confluence, the boundary between the military districts of the [[West-mark]] and [[East-mark]].<ref>{{UT|11b}}, footnote after East-mark in the first paragraph</ref>\n\n==History==\nAfter the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], King [[Théoden]] and his riders took a mountain path that led down into Harrowdale. On [[9 March]] {{TA|3019}},<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> they descended into the valley following a stream that finally joined the Snowbourn. The next day the Host of the Mark mustered in the fields beside the river and then followed the path of the river as it passed [[Underharrow]] and [[Upbourn]]. The Host camped in the willow-thickets where the Snowbourn met the Entwash. From there the riders continued on to [[Minas Tirith]].<ref name=\"Muster\" />\n\n==Etymology==\n''Snowbourn'' is a modernized form of [[Old English]] ''snāwburna''.<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 776</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2012: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:After passing [[Underharrow]] as it flows through [[Harrowdale]], Snowbourn becomes relatively calm, with several bridges and fords providing points of crossing. Just west of [[Edoras]] it is joined by its main tributary, river \"Woodwell\". Where it joins the [[Entwash]] stands the town of Snowbourn, unique in all of [[Rohan]] because distinctly Rohirric buildings surround an old [[Gondor]]ian stone fort.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Rivers of Rohan]]\n\n[[de:Schneeborn]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/eaux/rohan/snowbourn]]\n[[fi:Lumivuo]]"}}}
