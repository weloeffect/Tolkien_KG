Tolkien]] as the [[W.P. Ker Lecture|W.P. Ker Memorial Lecture]] at the University of Glasgow on [[15 April]] [[1953]].<ref>{{MC|F}}, p. 2</ref> It has been published in ''[[The Monsters and the Critics, and Other Essays]]'' and in some editions of Tolkien's translations of ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, and Sir Orfeo]]''.\n\nThe lecture focuses on the Third Fit (the third of four major divisions of the poem), which Tolkien says expresses the major themes of the work. Tolkien considers especially the temptation of Gawain (when the Lady of the Castle, Sir Bertilak's wife, invites him to commit adultery) and his later confession and absolution.\n\n{{references}}"}}}
