These are again divided in two categories. The first category is “block-stones”, such as coloured marbles and wet-rocks (or limestone). The second is “slab-stones”, such as schist, flint and slate.<ref name=\"firstpage\">{{ICE|2010}}, p. 190</ref>\n==Naurond==\n'''''Naurond''''' (S. “Fire-rock”) is the Dwarven term for igneous rocks, such as commonly found in [[Khazad-dûm]]. Examples are are granite, basalt and pumice.\n\nThese are again divided in two categories. The first category is “block-stones”, such as coloured marbles and wet-rocks (or limestone).

''Fenen'' (S. “Veils”) or ''Hidden Crystals'' are terms for glasses, while ''Maegelenath'' (S. “Sharp-stars”) or ''Bold Crystals'' are terms for gemstones.<ref name=\"firstpage\"/>\n\n===Laen===\n'''''Laen''''' (“Long Thread”) is the most notable of the glasses. It is as hard as diamond yet smooth, and enchanted state allows it to be moulded when cooled to very low temperatures. In its natural state it is black, but when worked it can be coloured or made clear. <ref name=\"firstpage\"/> Its name refers to its long crystal lattice structure.<ref>{{ICE|2010}}, p. 167</ref>\n\n==Ulgond==\n'''''Ulgond''''' is a liquid stone used extensively by the [[Gwaith-i-Mirdain]]. When poured into wooden moulds it will harden over time.<ref>{{ICE|2010}}, p. 191</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Materials from adaptations]]\n[[Category:MERP]]"}}}
