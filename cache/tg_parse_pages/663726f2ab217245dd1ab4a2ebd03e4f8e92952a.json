Shelob's Lair</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nAn earlier version of what would later become the chapter The Stairs of Cirith Ungol mentions that Frodo saw the glimmer of the wraith-road that led over the ''Morghul Pass'' from the city when he looked down from the stairs into the Morgul Vale.<ref name=WR/>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2019: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Morgul Pass is guarded by a great gate called \"Fennas Gost\".
