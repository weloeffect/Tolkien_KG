Ontamo was invented for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'' by [[Amazon Studios]]. He appeared in season one of the series and was portrayed by [[Anthony Crum]].<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9788618/fullcredits|articlename=Full Cast & Crew|dated=|website=IMDB|accessed=28 July 2022}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nOntamo was a close friend of fellow Númenoreans [[Isildur]] and [[Valandil (The Rings of Power)|Valandil]], whom he joined in training to become part of the Númenorean [[Sea Guard]]. He was engaged to a Númenorean woman named [[Mairen (Rings of Power)|Mairen]].\n\nIsildur deliberately squandered his own chances of becoming a Sea Guard by failing a task on a cadet training ship so that he could instead pursue the cause of the faithful like his brother [[Anárion]]. As a result of Isildur's self-sabotage, the Sail Master in charge of their training dismissed not only Isildur, but Ontamo and Valandil as well. Ontamo was upset by this but, unlike Valandil, he remained friends with Isildur.\n\nAfter [[Nimloth (tree)|Nimloth]] began to shed its pedals, Queen Regent [[Tar-Míriel|Míriel]] announced the formation of an expeditionary force to the [[Southlands]] of [[Middle-earth]] to aid the [[Pre-Númenóreans|Southlanders]] against [[Adar (The Rings of Power)|Adar]] and install [[Halbrand]] as their king. Ontamo joined this expedition along with Valandil and Isildur.\n\nThe three later arrived in Middle-earth and, fighting alongside the expeditionary forces, defeated Adar's [[Orcs]] in [[Tirharad]]. Reflecting on the battle, Ontamo found that he had no taste for war. To his great misfortune, more violence would come, as [[Mount Doom|Orodruin]] erupted shortly thereafter, resulting Tirharad's ruin. \n\nOntamo joined Valandil and Isildur in the rescue efforts following the eruption. He was crushed killed when a burning building collapsed during these efforts.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Ontamo'' is a [[Quenya]] word meaning \"mason\" or \"sculptor.\"<ref>{{Cite web|articleurl=https://www.elfdict.com/w/ontamo/q#:~:text=ontamo%20noun%20%22mason%20(sculptor),%22%20%2B%20tamo%20%22smith|articlename=Parf Edhellen: Ontamo|accessed=19 October 2024|website=Parf Edhellen: an elvish dictionary}}</ref>{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Men from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) characters]]"}}}
