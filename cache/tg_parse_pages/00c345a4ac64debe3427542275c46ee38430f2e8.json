As the [[Noldoli]] travelled along the coasts of [[Eldamar]] during their [[Exile of the Noldor|exile]] from [[Valinor]], they came to Amnos before they reached the [[Helkaraksë]]. A servant of [[Vefántur]] saw them there and asked that they turn back. When they refused, he stood on a tall rock and spoke the [[Doom of Mandos|Prophecies of Amnos]], which warned of hardships to come. The prophecy was named for Amnos, as that was the place where it was spoken. Thus, this place was later called ''Hanstovánen''.<ref>{{LT1|VII}}, p. 167</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\n''Hanstovánen'' was also written as ''Mornielta'' and ''Vane Hansto'', but some of these were struck out, and ''Hanstovánen'' appears to be the final form, being the one used in the narrative.<ref name=notes>{{LT1|VIIn}}</ref>{{rp|170}}\n\nThe name ''Amnos'' was emended from ''Emnon'', which was an emendation from ''Morniento''.<ref name=notes>{{LT1|VIIn}}</ref>{{rp|170}} In the following Lost Tale, the location is referred as the strands of '''''Amnor'''''.<ref>{{LT1|VIII}}, pp. 176, 197</ref>\n\nA prophecy by [[Amnon]] referenced by [[Turgon]] in ''[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Tale of the Fall of Gondolin]]'' resembled the Prophecies of Amnos, but here Amnon was a prophet rather than a location. A few other notes for Lost Tales mention a Prophecy of Amnon, but these do not specify whether Amnon was a person or place.<ref name=notes/>{{rp|172}}\n\nIn ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', the [[Doom of the Noldor]] is given in the lands of [[Araman]].<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Amnon]]\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hanstovanen}}\n[[Category:Aman]]\n[[Category:Coasts]]\n[[Category:Locations in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Qenya locations]]"}}}
