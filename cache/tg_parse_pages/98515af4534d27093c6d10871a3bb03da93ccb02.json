Following the example of the British [[The Tolkien Society|Tolkien Society]], it steadily grew to its current member count of about 225 people<ref>[http://www.unquendor.nl/?page_id=179 Unquendor : Geschiedenis] (accessed 11 January 2021)</ref> from all over the Dutch-speaking world, though Flanders has its own Society, ''[[Elanor (Tolkien Society)|Elanor]]'', and [[:Category:South Africa|South Africa]] once had the now-defunct [[Haradrim (Tolkien Society)|''Haradrim'']]. In recent years Unquendor and Elanor have closely collaborated on events. The [[Deutsche Tolkien Gesellschaft e.V.|German Tolkien Society]] (DTG) has also joined on occasion.<ref>http://elanor.deliverance.be/?tag=tolkien-verenigingen</ref>\n\n==Members of Note==\n*[[Jan Boom|Jan Boom (a.k.a. Fangorn)]]\n*[[René van Rossenberg|René van Rossenberg (a.k.a. Parmahosta)]]\n*[[Renée Vink]]\n\n==Gatherings==\nUnquendor organises a number of events throughout the Netherlands with attendance from throughout the country (and historically also some members from Flanders):\n*The \"''Joelfeest''\" ([[Yule]] party, December)\n*Hobbit Day and Annual General Meeting (historically/statutorily September, now in December)\n*\"''Slotfeest''\" (Castle/End Feast, June),\n*\"''3-januari-diner''\" (Tolkien Birthday Dinner, [[3 January|3 January]])\n*Tolkien Seminar (irregularly, in collaboration with University Leiden)<ref>https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/events/2018/05/unquendor-tolkien-seminar-2018-the-world-tolkien-built</ref><ref>https://signumuniversity.org/event/nedermoot-2019/</ref><ref><nowiki>https://www.unquendor.nl/?tribe_events=tolkien-seminar-2020</nowiki></ref>\nThese events were discontinued:\n*\"''Tolkien Leesdag''\" (Tolkien Reading Day, close to [[25 March|25 March]], the last event was in [[2017]])<ref>https://www.facebook.com/events/tolkienwinkel/tolkien-leesdag-2017/582560101934203/?paipv=0&eav=AfZdEIY6v9Z6XR1FaHomyLwRAhRyFffHm4mQMB3HmI3gVWBmGkXIRIAgRa5WlDlzCKo&_rdr</ref>\nUnquendor also offers more regular meetings organised by its members throughout the Netherlands, called ''Herbergen'' (\"Inns\") in analogy of the Tolkien Society's ''smials''. Unquendor's Lay of Leithian is the only inn that is also a Tolkien Society ''smial''.<ref>https://www.tolkiensociety.org/society/smials/</ref> This inn also closely collaborates with a regulars table (\"''stammtisch\"'') of the German Tolkien Society just across the border.<ref>https://www.tolkiengesellschaft.de/stammtische/geldern-linker-niederrhein/</ref> Both groups share a similar regiolect (Low Franconian).<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Franconian</ref>\n\n===Lustrum===\nEvery five years, Unquendor organizes a weekend event to celebrate an additional 5 years of the society being in existence, with the most recent being [[2021]]. These events are more international in nature and usually include lectures by known Tolkien scholars and artists:  [[Dimitra Fimi|Dimitra Fimi (2021),]] [[Thomas Honegger]] / [[Paul Smith]] (2016), [[Cor Blok]] (2006), [[Tom Shippey]] (2011), [[Rayner Unwin]] (1997), [[Arne Zettersten]] (2006).\n\n==Publications==\nUnquendor also publishes the Dutch language magazine ''[[Lembas (journal)|Lembas]]'' four to five times a year. The magazine contains the accounts and announcements of Unquendor events. Ardalogical and Tolkienistical essays are also included. These are typically written by members of Unquendor. Unquendor also publishes ''[[Lembas Extra]] (''irregularly) in English. Longer length Tolkienological and Ardalogical articles are included therein. ''Lembas Extra'' includes articles by members and non-members alike.\n\n==Etymology==\n'''Unquendor''' is [[Neo-Quenya]] for \"Hollow Land\", and is a translation of the often perceived etymology of [[wikipedia:Holland#The name .22Holland.22|Holland]], also \"Hollow land\". The correct etymology is of Holland, however, is \"Wooded land\". \"Hollow land\" does apply to [[wikipedia:Holland, Lincolnshire|Holland in Lincolnshire, UK]].\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.unquendor.nl/ Official website]\n*[https://www.instagram.com/unquendor/?hl=en Official Instagram]\n*[https://www.facebook.com/groups/unquendor/ Official Facebook]\n*[https://twitter.com/Unquendor Official X]\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Dutch organizations]]\n[[Category:Tolkien Societies]]\n[[de:Die niederländische Tolkien Gesellschaft Unquendor]]"}}}
