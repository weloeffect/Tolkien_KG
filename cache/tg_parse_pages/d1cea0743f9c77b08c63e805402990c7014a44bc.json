The Kings of Arnor were descended from [[Elendil]] and the [[Lords of Andúnië]]. The line would persist even after the fall of Arnor, and would eventually resurface at the end of the [[Third Age]] to retake the kingship of the North Kingdom.\n\nThe title is tied to that of the [[Heir of Isildur]] and the [[High King of the Dúnedain]].\n\n==History==\nOriginally, Elendil was the [[High King (Dúnedain)|High King]] of both [[Gondor]] and Arnor. After his death in {{SA|3441}}, he was followed by his son [[Isildur]], who retained the title of High King,<ref name=\"app\">{{App|Exile}}</ref> but died along with three of his sons on his way to Arnor in {{TA|2}} after leaving Gondor in the care of [[Meneldil]].<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> [[Valandil]], Isildur's youngest and only surviving son, was too young to rule, leaving the kingship of Gondor to the [[House of Anárion]]. When he grew old enough to rule, Valandil claimed only the kingship of Arnor.<ref name=\"Elendil\">{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 192</ref>\n\nAfter King [[Eärendur]], the realm of [[Arnor]] was split between his three sons, founding the realms of [[Arthedain]], [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]]. The [[House of Isildur]] continued with the '''[[Kings of Arthedain]]'''.<ref name=\"North\">{{App|North}}</ref> Though also Heirs of Isildur, the kings of Arthedain are listed distinctly from the kings of Arnor. The title of \"King of Arnor\" would fall into disuse.\n\nBy {{TA|1349}}, the House of Isildur had died out in Cardolan and Rhudaur. [[Argeleb I]] of Arthedain again claimed the title '''King of Arnor'''.<ref name=\"North\" /> However, much of the territory that once belonged to Arnor had fallen out of his hands, and Argeleb and his descendants were counted as kings of Arthedain in the lists of the [[Red Book of Westmarch]].<ref name=\"North\" />\n\nAfter the death of the last king of Arthedain, [[Arvedui]], the Northern Kingdom was no more. The line of Kings continued in the [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain]], ruling over the [[Rangers of the North]].<ref name=\"app\" />\n\nThough the kings of Arnor faded, some folk maintained the faint belief that the kings would return. These included the [[Hobbits]], who would retain the saying \"until the king comes back\" and also attributed their few rules and laws to the king as well. The memory of the northern kings would also not be forgotten in Gondor, where the line of kings had failed altogether.\n\nIn {{FoA|1}}, the kings of the North returned in the figure of [[Aragorn II Elessar]], who became king of Gondor and soon afterwards re-established the realm of Arnor, as well as the title of ''King of Arnor''. He and his descendants afterwards would reign over the [[Reunited Kingdom]], but after [[Eldarion]] Elessar's son, the Red Book records no more of the heirs of Elendil.\n\n==Office and duties==\nThe king of Arnor had similar powers and duties to those of the king of Gondor. The king would have control over the military of Arnor. He also had the authority to grant lands to others as fiefs or vassals. For instance, the Shire was originally a grant from the king to the hobbits. King Elessar would renew this grant upon his own accession to the throne, naming several officials of the Shire such as the [[Thain]] as a [[Counsellor of the North-kingdom]].<ref name=\"AppBLater\">{{App|B5}}, p. 1441</ref>\n\nThe King would also have the legal right both to use a [[Palantíri|palantír]] and to appoint someone to do so in his stead.<ref>{{UT|Palantiri}}</ref> In the days of the split realm, Arthedain controlled the palantíri of [[Elostirion]] and [[Annúminas]], while both Cardolan and Rhudaur contested the ownership of the palantír of [[Amon Sûl]] (later [[Weathertop]]).\n\nThere were several heirlooms the King would wear or use as signs of their authority. The most famous of these were the shards of [[Narsil]], the broken sword of Elendil. Another was the [[Ring of Barahir]], received from [[Finrod Felagund]] during the Elder Days by an [[Barahir|ancient ancestor]]. Additionally, the kings possessed the [[Sceptre of Annúminas]], a silver rod from the days of [[Numenor]].<ref>{{App|North}}, p. 1365</ref>\n\nThere was one more artefact used by the Kings of Arnor: the [[Elendilmir]], a white gem set in a fillet (or crown) made of [[mithril]]. The original gem was an heirloom worn by Isildur, but it was lost in the river [[Anduin]] upon his death at the [[Battle of the Gladden Fields]]. However, it ended up in [[Orthanc]] after [[Saruman]] stole the body of Isildur from the [[Gladden Fields]]. It was rediscovered during the reign of Elessar, who would wear the fillet on his brow on certain high days.<ref>{{UT|Gladden}}</ref> A copy of the Elendilmir was made for the Kings of Arnor by the smiths of Elrond, and this copy was used as an heirloom of the house of Isildur even after they lost the kingship. After the recovery of the original, it would continue to see use on occasions where the original Elendilmir was not worn.\n\n==List of High Kings==\n{|class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n|- style=\"background: var(--tg-color-surface-2);\" \n!
