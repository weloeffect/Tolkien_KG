This group was also often called the '''High Elves'''.\n\n==History==\nThe Calaquendi included the [[Vanyar]], [[Noldor]], and those [[Teleri]] (the [[Falmari]]) who passed over [[Belegaer]], as well as the [[Sindar]]in King [[Thingol]] (alone of all his people). Another name for them was the [[Amanyar]] (with the exception of Thingol, who was not counted among them), \"Those of Aman\". Those kindreds who settled in [[Aman]] or descended from them were also referred to as '''High Elves''', or '''Tareldar'''<ref>{{HM|PM}}, pp. 349, 360</ref> in the lore of the [[Dúnedain]].<ref>{{PM|Atani}}</ref>\n\nThose of the Elves who refused the summons of the [[Valar]] or did not complete the [[Great Journey]] to [[Valinor]] were called the ''Úmanyar'', meaning \"Not of Aman\" and \"[[Moriquendi]]\", or Dark Elves (those who had not seen the light). King [[Thingol|Elu Thingol]] of [[Doriath]] held the unique status of being both among the Calaquendi and the Úmanyar, since he originally saw the Light, being one of the three ambassadors brought to Aman by [[Oromë]], but did not return to Aman during the [[Great Journey]].\n\nThe High Elves returned to [[Middle-earth]] because of the [[Exile of the Noldor]], participated in the [[Wars of Beleriand]] and other events of the [[Second Age|Second]] and [[Third Age]]. \n\nBy the later Third Age, most of the High Elves resided in or had returned to Aman; only a few remained in [[Middle-earth]], some in [[Rivendell]]. [[Wandering Companies]] of High Elves would traverse [[Eriador]] and [[the Shire]] from time to time; [[Frodo Baggins]] recognised one of those bands as being High Elves, because of chanting the name of [[Elbereth]].<ref>{{FR|Three}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Calaquendi'' consists of [[Quenya]] ''[[cala]]'' (\"light\"), and ''[[quendi]]'' (\"elves\"); thus: \"Elves of Light\".\nThe singular form of the Quenya noun is ''Calaquendë''.<ref>{{WJ|B}}, p. 373</ref>\n\nCognates of the name ''Calaquendi'' in other languages are [[Telerin]] ''[[Calapendi]]'' and [[Sindarin]] ''[[Calben|Calbin]]''.<ref>{{WJ|A}}, p. 362</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn ''[[The Hobbit]]'', '''Light-elves''' was a name given to the [[Vanyar]].<ref name=H8>{{H|8}}</ref> This term was used just once in this application, and never again in any [[canon]]ical source.<ref group=note>The other two groups of Elves mentioned in this part of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' were the \"[[Noldor|Deep-elves]]\" (referring to the [[Noldor]]) and the \"[[Falmari|Sea-elves]]\" (referring to the [[Falmari]]).</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nIn [[Norse mythology]], there are the Light Elves (''[[Wikipedia:Light elves|Ljósálfar]]'') and the [[Moriquendi|Dark Elves]] (''Dökkálfar'' or ''[[Wikipedia:Svartálfar|Svartálfar]]''), a tradition which was well known to [[J.R.R.
