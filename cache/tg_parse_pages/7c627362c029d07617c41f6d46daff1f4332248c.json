[[Christopher Tolkien]] does not provide a copy of any original writings, but explains how his father conceived of both ''[[The Fall of Númenor (chapter)|The Fall of Númenor]]'' and ''[[The Lost Road]]''.\n\n==Synopsis==\n[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and [[C.S. Lewis]], unsatisfied with the stories they read, picked two themes and decided to write stories themselves:<ref name=Early>{{LR|P1I}}</ref>{{rp|7}}\n\n{{blockquote|We agreed that he should try 'space travel', and I should try 'time-travel'. His result is well known. My effort, after a few promising chapters, ran dry: it was too long a way round to what I really wanted to make, a new version of the [[Atlantis-haunting|Atlantis]] legend. The final scene survives as ''[[Akallabêth|The Downfall of Númenor]]''.|[[Letter 294]]}}\n\nLewis's result was ''[[Out of the Silent Planet]]'', but Tolkien's abandoned effort was ''[[The Lost Road]]''. From [[Letter 257|a letter]] written a few years before, [[Christopher Tolkien]] suspects that his father's story was already conceived in connection with \"The Silmarillion\",<ref name=Early/>{{rp|10}} as Tolkien seems to imply that there was an agreement with Lewis that his version of Atlantis \"''was to be called Númenor''\". [[Humphrey Carpenter]] confirms this,<ref>{{HM|Bio}}, p. 170</ref> but Christopher concludes that both the time-travel story and the Númenórean legend were probably written at the same time.<ref name=Early/>{{rp|9}}\n\nIn any case, Tolkien explains that he began the story of a father and son travelling back through the different phases of the history, eventually reaching the time of the Downfall of Númenor. But soon he lost interest in the main time-travel plot, and became more interested in Númenor itself.<ref name=Early/>{{rp|8}} Therefore, he abandoned the story, but the Downfall remained in his [[legendarium]] and was later developed as the [[Second Age]].\n\nIt is unknown the exact date of the initial conversation of Tolkien and Lewis, although we know that Lewis finished by the autumn of [[1937]] and Tolkien submitted ''The Lost Road'' (unfinished) to [[Allen & Unwin]] on [[15 November]] of the same year.<ref>{{LB|Note}}, p. 364</ref>\n==External links==\n*[http://johngarth.wordpress.com/2017/03/31/when-tolkien-reinvented-atlantis-and-lewis-went-to-mars/ When Tolkien reinvented Atlantis and Lewis went to Mars: Discovering the dates of ''The Fall of Númenor'' and ''Out of the Silent Planet''] by [[John Garth]]\n{{References}}"}}}
