This strong metal is difficult to work with once forged.<ref name=\"firstpage\">{{ICE|2010}}, p. 186</ref>\n==Cranor==\n'''''Cranor''''' (“Tree-gold”) is a resin invented by the [[Daen]] of the [[White Mountains]] that stores static electricity. The extremely hard substance is made using the Sorglasora (“Gold-pine”) sap and the White Lily nectar. It was used to entomb Dunnish Chieftains.<ref name=\"firstpage\"/>\n==Eog==\n'''''Eog''''' ([[Dursindarin|Du.]] “[[Eöl]]'s Iron” or “Ang Eöl”) is described as a fusion of mithril and durang with unknown other materials. The Elven recipe, thought to originate from the House of Eöl, requires both hot and cold forging. The very hard material can be made in many colours.<ref name=\"firstpage\"/>\n==Ithilnaur==\n'''''Ithilnaur'''''  ([[Sindarin|S.]] “Moon-fire”) is an alloy of mithril with other materials such as titanium. It is common in [[Moria]].<ref name=\"secondpage\">{{ICE|2010}}, p. 187</ref>\n==Kregora==\n'''''Kregora''''' a very malleable dull-yellow metal, used to line surfaces against spells.<ref name=\"secondpage\"/>\n==Mithrarian==\n'''''Mithrarian''''' (“Abyss of High Silver”) is a rare alloy of [[#eog|eog]], Mithril, and [[#Other metals|Celebur]] introduced by [[Annatar]]. Objects lined with it would float. The [[Gwaith-i-Mirdain]] were reluctant to work with it, given the nature of the aforementioned Celebur.<ref>{{ICE|2010}}, p. 188</ref>\n==Ogamur==\n'''''Ogamur''''' (S. “From [[Gamur]]”) is a Dwarven metal that is very flexible. The recipe, derived from an eastern Dwarf-house, is a closely guarded secret. The [[Noldor]] are required to purchase it because of this.<ref name=\"fourthpage\">{{ICE|2010}}, p. 189</ref>\n==Tasarang==\n'''''Ogamur''''' (S. “Willow-iron”; [[Westron|W.]] Shalk) is a white metal that resembles white ogamur. It does not stretch. Its chalk-white ore is found below limestone intrusions.<ref name=\"fourthpage\"/>\n\n==Other metals==\nNon-fictional types of material are treated in a similar fashion:<ref>{{ICE|2010}}, pp. 186-189</ref>\n* '''''Alcam''''' (S. “Tin”)\n* '''''Celebur''''' (S. “Burning Silver”) — weak uranium ore\n* '''''Galnin''''' (S. “Shining-white” or Aluminium)\n* '''''Mithglín''''' (S. “Gleaming Grey” or Platinum)\n* '''''Mithin''''' (S. “Pale Grey” or Beryllium)\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Materials from adaptations]]\n[[Category:MERP]]"}}}
