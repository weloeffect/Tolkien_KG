During the Second Age, however, these forests were decimated by the [[Númenóreans]] in their greed for ship-building timber, before being almost completely burnt down by the forces of [[Sauron]] during the ensuing war in Eriador.<ref name=UT/>\n\nBy the latter half of the Second Age, the surviving natives of Minhiriath had retreated either north to [[Bree]], or hidden themselves in Eryn Vorn which was probably all that remained of the vast forests in Minhiriath for long years thereafter.<ref name=RClxv/> \n\nFrom {{TA|861}}, Eryn Vorn nominally formed a part of [[Cardolan]] and by the end of the Third Age, scattered woodlands had reappeared in much of the rest of Minhiriath. \n\nIt is probable that people remained hidden in Eryn Vorn by the [[Third Age]]. Although Bree was the westernmost permanent settlement of [[Men]] by the late Third Age,<ref>{{FR|Sign}}, p. 149</ref> the woods of Minhiriath were home of a few, secretive hunter-folk at the time of the [[War of the Ring]]. These wild people were afraid to cross the river [[Baranduin]] because of the Elves who dwelt beyond.<ref name=UT/><ref group=\"note\">These Elves surely are the Elves of [[Lindon]], the realm located north of the cape.<!-- noted by User:Morgan --></ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n\n''Eryn Vorn'' is [[Sindarin]] and has been given the translation \"Blackwood\". The name consists of ''[[eryn]]'' (\"wood\") and ''vorn'' (\"dark\"),<ref name=RClxv>{{HM|RC}}, p. lxv</ref> the latter being the [[lenition|lenited]] form of ''[[morn]]''.<ref>[[Helge Fauskanger]], \"[http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/sindarin.htm Sindarin - the Noble Tongue: I.

Tolkien|Tolkien]] had supplied [https://www.tolkiensociety.org/2015/11/tolkiens-annotated-map-of-middle-earth-transcribed/ notes] on additional names.
