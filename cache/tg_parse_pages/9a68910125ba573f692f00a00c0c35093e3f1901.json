Though often called by the name of dwelling places, the true names of the brothers were Námo, the elder, and Irmo, the younger. \n\nIrmo, who resided in Lórien, was the master of visions and dreams. His gardens were the fairest in the world and filled with many spirits.  Often the Valar would come to his gardens to rest and find ease from the burdens of Arda. \n\nNámo, who resided in Mandos, had power over the ''[[fëar]]'' of Elves and Men who gathered in his halls after death, where the ''fëar'' of the Elves abode while those of Men soon left the Circles of the World. Námo delivered judgement on [[Manwë]]'s bidding in serious matters (such as the [[Doom of the Noldor]]) but also judged over the fate of the elvish ''fëar''.\n\n[[Nienna]] is the sister of the Fëanturi, who mourned [[Melkor]]'s marring of [[Arda]]. She resided west of West, near the halls of Mandos, which she often entered to bring strength and wisdom to the ''fëar'' there.<ref name=\"Vala\"/> However, she is never explicitly mentioned as a member of the Fëanturi.\n\nNienna and Mandos are counted among the [[Aratar]] - the eight greatest of the Valar - while their brother Irmo is not.\n\n==Etymology==\n''Fëanturi'' is a [[Quenya]] compound: ''[[fea]]'' (\"spirit\") + pl. ''[[tur]]'' (\"master, lord\").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entries ''[[fëa]]'', ''[[tur]]''</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Etymologies]]'' appears a [[Noldorin]] equivalent of the name ''Fëanturi'': '''''i-Fennyr''''' or '''''Fennuir'''''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 387 (entry SPAN-)</ref><ref>{{VT|46a}}, p. 15</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' the word appears as [[Qenya]] ''Fantur'', pl. ''Fanturi'', with the [[Gnomish]] forms ''Fanthor'', pl. ''i-Fanthaurin'', all deriving from the [[root]] FANA.<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry \"Fanturi\"</ref>\n\nThe word produces the Qenya names ''Vefantur'' (the Fantur of Death, Mandos) and ''Olofantur'' (the Fantur of Dreams, Lórien).<ref>{{LT1|III}}, p. 66</ref>\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Feanturi}}\n[[Category:Quenya demonyms]]\n[[Category:Valar]]\n[[Category:Valarin titles]]\n[[de:Feanturi]]\n[[fi:Fëanturi]]"}}}
