He also served as an additional second unit director; he describes one of his works as \"[i]t was the bit where the hobbits were being dragged from the burning tavern by the orcs\"<sup>[http://www.pukeariki.com/en/stories/arts/titokowarufilm.htm]</sup>, which made it into the trailer for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''. It is unclear as to what scene he is referring; no scene matching his description is in the trailer. He could be referring to a scene shot for the [[The Mirror of Galadriel (scene)|The Mirror of Galadriel]] scene in ''The Fellowship of the Ring''.\n\nIn June [[2007]], he and 14 other actors filed [https://us.imdb.com/news/ni0058227/ a lawsuit] against [[New Line Cinema]] over merchandising royalties.<ref>{{webcite|author=MrCere|articleurl=https://www.theonering.net/torwp/2007/06/01/23983-actors-join-to-sue-new-line-over-lotr-merchandising/|articlename=Actors join to sue New Line over LOTR merchandising|dated=1 June 2007|website=TORN|accessed=3 December 2024}}</ref> The action was settled out of court in October [[2008]].<ref>{{webcite|author=MrCere|articleurl=https://www.theonering.net/torwp/2008/10/08/30205-new-zealand-actors-settle-out-of-court-with-new-line-cinema/|articlename=New Zealand actors settle out of court with New Line|dated=8 October 2008|website=TORN|accessed=3 December 2024}}</ref>\n\n==Quotes==\n{{quote|There were three grades of rubber feet - there were the Cadillacs (for the stars), Fords for the smaller parts and the extras had Fiats.
