It is described as a vast darkness that no light can escape or penetrate. As Ungoliant devoured the [[Two Trees of Valinor|Light of the Trees]], she brought forth the Unlight, and \"it seemed not lack, but a thing with being of its own, that made by malice out of Light had the power to pierce the eye, to enter the heart and mind and strangle the very will\".<ref name=MR>{{MR|P3II7}}</ref>{{rp|289}}\n\n==History==\nUngoliant wove this darkness into webs, which covered her lair in [[Avathar]].
