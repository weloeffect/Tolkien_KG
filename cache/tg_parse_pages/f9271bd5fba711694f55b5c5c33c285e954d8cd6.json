Tolkien - The Three Trolls are turned to Stone.jpg|\"The Three Trolls are turned to Stone\"]] by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]</ref> ('''William ''Huggins''''', '''Tom''', and '''Bert''') were a group of [[trolls]] that captured [[Bilbo Baggins]] and the [[Thorin and Company|dwarves]] during the [[Quest of Erebor]].\n\n==History==\nThey lived in a [[Trolls' lair|cave]] in the [[Trollshaws]], west of [[Rivendell]]. In the spring of {{TA|2941}}, they had journeyed down out of the hills in search of food, having been led by William to the area. They had already eaten their way through a village or two before stopping for the night in the woods not far from [[East-West Road|Great Road]].<ref>{{H|Mutton}}, p. 70</ref>\n\nThe light of the trolls fire was spotted by [[Balin]] who alerted the rest of the company, and on [[Thorin]]'s urging, it was Bilbo that approached and first encountered the three trolls, who were drinking, eating mutton and bickering.\n\nBilbo was captured while trying to pickpocket William's purse and when the rest of the company came to investigate what had happened to Bilbo they too were captured. Only Thorin put up a fight, putting out Bert's eye with a flaming branch and then hitting Tom in the face, knocking out a tooth. William caught Thorin and so all the dwarves were captured in sacks.\n\nGandalf, however, had returned unnoticed and throwing his voice, caused the trolls to argue amongst themselves for so long that the sun rose and turned all three of them to stone.\n\nOn [[18 October]] {{TA|3018}}, Strider and the [[Travellers|four hobbits]] came across the stone statues of the three trolls whilst travelling to Rivendell with the [[One Ring]].<ref>{{FR|Flight}}, p. 205</ref>\n\n==William's \"pity\"==\nWilliam twice stated that they ought to let Bilbo go rather than eat him, calling Bilbo a \"poor little blighter\", which leads to a row with Bert. William's comments are curious as trolls are evil by nature, having been created by [[Morgoth]] in the twilight of the [[Elder Days]]. William, however, is noted to have \"already had as much supper as he could hold; also he had had lots of beer.\"<ref>{{App|F1iv}}</ref>\n\nIn an unsent [[Letter 153|letter]] to Christian book shop owner [[Peter Hastings]], [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] responded to this subject:\n\n{{blockquote|There is no more 'pity' here than in a beast of prey yawning, or lazily patting a creature it could eat, but does not want to, since it is not hungry. Or indeed than there is in many of men's actions, whose real roots are in satiety, sloth, or a purely non-moral natural softness, though they may dignify them by 'pity's' name.<ref>{{L|153}}</ref>}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Talking purse|William's talking purse]]\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===William, Tom, and Bert in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"250px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Hobbit (1977 film) - Trolls.png|[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1977 film)]]\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring - Tom, Bert and Bill.jpg|''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''\nFile:The Hobbit - An Unexpected Journey - Bert, Bill and Tom.jpg|''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]''\nFile:Omar Rayyan - Wuluag.jpg|Wûluag in the ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]''\nFile:Omar Rayyan - Tûma.png|Tûma in the ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]''\nFile:Omar Rayyan - Bûrat.png|Bûrat in the ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]'' \nFile:Games Workshop - The Hobbit - Bill.png|''\"Bill\" in [[The Hobbit Strategy Battle Game]]''\nFile:Games Workshop - The Hobbit - Tom.png|''\"Tom\" in [[The Hobbit Strategy Battle Game]]''\nFile:Games Workshop - The Hobbit - Bert.png|''\"Bert\" in [[The Hobbit Strategy Battle Game]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Tom, Bert and Bill.jpg|''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\n</gallery>\n'''[[1968]]: [[The Hobbit (1968 radio series)|''The Hobbit'' (1968 radio series)]]:'''\n:The trolls are encountered in the second episode, \"Out of the Frying-pan into the Fire\".
