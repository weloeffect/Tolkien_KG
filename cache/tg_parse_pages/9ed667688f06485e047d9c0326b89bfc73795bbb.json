If its meaning is \"should\", there is a possibility that it is a cognate or related to the [[Quenya]] expression ''[[nai]]'', \"may it be that\".\n==Example==\nThe word ''aen'' is seen in the phrase of the ''[[King's Letter]]''\n\n*''[[i]] [[sennui]] \"[[Panthael]]\" [[esta]]thar aen''\n\nThis is translated as \"who ought to be called 'Fullwise'\"<ref>{{HM|SD}} p.126</ref> (referring to [[Samwise Gamgee|Samwise]]).\n\n==Syntax==\n''aen'' follows the verb ''estathar'', which is future tense and means \"they will name\". It is not known if ''aen'' can follow verbs of other tenses. Likewise, it is not known if ''aen'' is the pronoun (\"'''they''' should name him Fullwiise\"), a marker of the passive voice (\"He should '''be called''' Fullwise\"), or an optative marker which expresses a wish (\"Whom instead '''should''' call Fullwise\").\n\nAnother riddle is the word ''[[sennui]]'', which is also of unknown meaning, with possibilities being \"should\" or \"instead\".\n==See also==\n*[[sennui]]\n*[[nai]]\n==External links==\n*[http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/online/sindar/dict-sd-en.html Hiswelókë's Sindarin dictionary], see entries for ''aen'' and ''sennui''\n{{references}}\n{{title|lowercase}}\n[[Category:Sindarin words]]"}}}
