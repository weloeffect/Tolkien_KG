Art for the back cover of ''[[Parma Eldalamberon 10]]''.]]\nNuin is said to be very wise and loved to travel with his folk. Once he wandered far to the east of [[Palisor]] until curiosity led him to a strange place, with a mountainous wall. He found a passage which led to a valley inside a mountainous circle, [[Murmenalda]], the Vale of Sleep. There he saw sleeping forms, others alone, other entangled into the arms of others. Frightened, he went back to Tû and told his tale, and Tû replied to him that they were the [[Men|Younger]] [[Children of Ilúvatar]].<ref>{{LT1|X}}</ref>\n\nThe story, known as \"Gilfanon's Tale\", stops and its development is known only from outlines. According to them, Tû warned Nuin that it was not yet the time of Men to wake yet as they needed light, but Nuin visited the valley often and pondered on the figures. Accidentally he stumbled against a sleeper who stirred, and then he was overcome with curiosity and awoke the first pair of [[Men]], [[Ermon]] and [[Elmir]], right before the first rising of the [[Sun]] from the [[West]]. Men were dumb and frightened, but Nuin taught them speech, some [[Ilkorin]] tongue, and thus was the '''Father of Speech'''. In another note, Nuin fights alongside Ermon in a fight against [[Fankil]] but he is killed by [[Goblins]], a result of the betrayal of Men.<ref>{{LT1|Xn}}</ref>\n\n[[Christopher Tolkien]] laments that \"Gilfanon's Tale\" remained unfinished and wondered whether his father consciously rejected the concepts of the story outright, or left it on hiatus, until his ideas were replaced by those of the later ''[[Silmarillion]]'' (''[[Of Men]]'').\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Battle of Palisor]]\n* [[Ermon]] & [[Elmir]]\n* [[Tû (king of the Hisildi)|Tû]]\n* [[Fankil]]\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Nuin}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Ilkorindi]]\n[[de:Nuin]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/elfes/nuin]]"}}}
