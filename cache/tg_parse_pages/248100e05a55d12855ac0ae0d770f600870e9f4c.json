Everyone obviously talks about the Peter Jackson movies, but when I was little, I had the animated Ralph Bakshi version from 1978. That was my total obsession, at the time. So, to be returning to this world, you walk on set, and of course, the little nine-year-old in you starts jumping up and down and remembering the excitement when you first encountered Tolkien. To be involved in it now is really very special.|Charles Edwards, Collider}}\n{{quote|He may have an ulterior motive for that, but Celebrimbor is very much in support of working together. Neither race would have produced the wonders that they had, that they created, without the aid of the other. So clearly, we're in a time of peace, certainly in terms of the working relationship, and (Celebrimbor) has great respect for them. And Dwarves have a reputation as being fanatical workers, and jewelers and crafters; and Celebrimbor very much respects that.|Charles Edwards, Outlookindia}}\n\n{{references}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{WP|Charles Edwards (actor)|Charles Edwards}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Edwards, Charles}}\n[[Category:Actors and actresses]]\n[[Category:British people]]\n[[Category:People by name]]\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) cast]]\n[[fi:Charles Edwards]]"}}}
