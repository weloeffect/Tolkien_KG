Formerly elves, they were taken by the Dark Powers, tortured and mutilated into a terrible form of life, now perfected by Saruman as the [[Uruk-hai]]. He then asks Lurtz who he serves, and he answers, \"Saruman.\"\n\nUnder Isengard, the Uruk-hai are readying for war, painting their faces with the [[White Hand]] of Saruman, and arming and armoring themselves. Saruman gives them a rousing speech, to which the Uruk-hai cheer. He then turns to Lurtz, giving him the orders that [[Frodo Baggins|one of the halflings]] carries [[The One Ring|an item of great value]], and that they are to be brought to him alive and unspoiled. They are to kill the others.\n\nThe orders given, Lurtz leads the Uruk-hai out of Isengard, beginning the hunt for the [[Fellowship of the Ring]].\n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring scenes|40]]"}}}
