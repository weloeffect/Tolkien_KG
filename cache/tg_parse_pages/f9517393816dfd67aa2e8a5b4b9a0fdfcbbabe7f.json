The elf agreed to answer them later, but first they had to eat breakfast. [[Littleheart]] brought food for Eriol, who spent the rest of the day walking in the garden. In the evening all gathered around the [[Tale-fire]] once again. Most of them wanted to play music and sing. However, after the songs they began to yearn for the lost beauty of past years and the rekindling of the [[Magic Sun]]. Eriol asked [[Lindo]] for Rúmil to tell about Valinor. Rúmil agreed and began:\n\n[[Manwë|Manwë Súlimo]] and [[Varda|Varda the Beautiful]] came to the world, flying with wings through [[Vaiya|Vaitya]], [[Ilmen|Ilwë]], and [[Vista|Vilna]], the three layers of the air. Lesser Vali, [[Sylphs|Mánir]] and [[Sylphs|Súruli]], accompanied them. [[Melko]] outstripped them and caused disturbance in the world, angering Manwë. After them the following Ainur came in sequence:\n\n* [[Ulmo]] (only with [[Salmar]] later called [[Salmar|Noldorin]]) and [[Aulë]] (with his wife, [[Yavanna|Palúrien]] later called [[Yavanna]]; and with [[Sprites|Nermir]], [[Sprites|Tavari]], [[Sprites|Nandini]], and [[Sprites|Orossi]]);\n* A vassal of Ulmo, [[Ossë|Falman-Ossë]], with his wife [[Uinen|Ónen]] and with [[Mermaids|Oarni]], [[Mermaids|Falmaríni]], and [[Mermaids|Wingildi]];\n* Young [[Tulkas|Tulkas Poldórëa]], brothers [[Fanturi]] ([[Irmo|Lórien Olofántur]] and [[Mandos|Mandos Vefántur]]), and twin sisters [[Tári]] ([[Nienna|Fui Nienna]] (wife of Mandos) and [[Vána]] (wife of [[Oromë]], the son of Aulë and Palúrien));\n* Quarrelsome [[Makar]] and his sister [[Meássë]], who came late;\n* The last was [[Ómar]] known also as [[Ómar|Amillo]], the youngest of the great Valar.\n\nManwë warned that Melko would cause destruction, and after some discussion among the Valar, Mandos and Tulkas were sent to capture him. Led before the face of Manwë, Melko claimed that he would cause no farther harm, and counselled the Valar to separate and live in their favourite domains. Manwë, Ulmo, Aulë and Palúrien mistrusted him, and chose to build a common residence so that Melko could not attack them one by one. Melko had already built [[Utumna]] and made north and south cold. In those days, silver and golden light was falling like rain and flowing like rivers, but it was too dark for Aulë to work. Therefore he asked Melko to build towers for [[two lamps]] he wanted to make, while Manwë and Varda gathered a great amount of the dispersed light to kindle the lamps. Melko helped Aulë, claiming that he built [[Ringil (tower)|Ringil]] and [[Helkar]] from an indestructible material. In truth, they were made from ice, and they soon melted, causing the lamps to fall and spill their light. So began the first long night. The Valar were trapped on an island until Ossë with the Oarni took it to [[Eruman]], where they decided to build their dwellings.\n\nAulë worked for seven ages building the foundations of [[Taniquetil]] whilst the Valar made [[Araman|Erumáni]] flat. Tired of the darkness, they collected golden and silver light in two cauldrons, [[Kulullin and Silindrin]]. Using some of the light from the cauldrons, gold, pearls and other ingredients - combined with the songs of Vána and Lórien - [[Palúrien]] caused the [[Two Trees of Valinor|Two Trees]], [[Laurelin]] and [[Telperion|Silpion]], to start growing. [[Urwen]] and [[Silmo]] were chosen to care for them.\n\nThen Aulë, with the help of Tulkas and Palúrien, finally could build homes for Valar in the city of [[Valmar]]:\n\n* Manwë had a [[Ilmarin|house]] on Taniquetil with a roof from ''ilwë''. His [[hawks]] and later [[Sorontur]], the king of [[eagles]], lived there too;\n* Aulë and Palúrien had a [[Mansions of Aulë|house]] made from light with metal threads;\n* Ossë had a house made by Ónen and Oarni from pearls;\n* Ulmo did not live in Valmar. When it was necessary, he was a guest of Manwë;\n* Lórien had a house called [[Murmuran]] made from mist, with a large garden in which Silmo watered Silpion from Silindrin;\n* Tulkas had a house where the feasts took place. Beautiful [[Nessa]], his wife, lived there and danced;\n* Noldolin and Amillo competed in songs and music;\n* Oromë had a [[House of Oromë|house]] and broad [[Woods of Oromë|forests]]. Vána, his wife, preferred to go to her garden. Urwen took there light from Kulullin for Laurelin;\n* Vefántur and Fui asked Aulë to build a house for them far from the beautiful ones of the other Valar. Mandos chose a large and dark hall, [[Halls of Mandos|Vê]] (from his name), for the deceased elves awaiting their rebirth and his wife another one, [[Halls of Nienna|Fui]] (also from her name), for deceased men (some of them stay there, some go to Melko's [[Angamandi]], many to [[Avathar|Arvalin]], and few to Valinor).\n* Makar and Meássë built themselves their house, not far from Mandos. Makar's subjects fought there continuously.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Coming of the Valar}}"}}}
