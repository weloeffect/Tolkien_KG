[[Gollum]] is uneasy and Frodo resolves to enter. They see a legion of [[Easterlings]] marching towards the Black Gate, which is opened by [[trolls]]. Sam edges on to a rock for a better view but it crumbles down the hillside, causing him to fall. Two Easterlings see some commotion on the hillside and move to investigate. Frodo reaches Sam who is stuck; he covers both of them with his [[Elven cloak]], causing them to appear as a large rock. The Easterlings, unwittingly standing over the [[Hobbits]], see nothing odd and return to the army marching into [[Mordor]]. \n\nAs the last Easterlings enter the Black Gate, Frodo makes to run into Mordor before the Gate can close, but Gollum stops him. \n{{blockquote|No! No! No master! They catch you! They catch you! Don’t take it to him. He wants the precious. Always he is looking for it. And the precious is wanting to go back to him.|Gollum}}\nFrodo tries to go to the Gate again, but again Gollum stops him, however this time, he tells Frodo that there is another way into Mordor – a darker and more secret way. Frodo asks him if there really is another way into Mordor.\n{{blockquote|Yes. There’s a path...and some stairs...and then...a tunnel.|Gollum}}\nAt this, Frodo decides to go by Gollum's alternative path, even though Sam is strongly opposed to it. The scene ends with the Black Gate closing. \n\n==Differences==\n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers scenes|18]]"}}}
