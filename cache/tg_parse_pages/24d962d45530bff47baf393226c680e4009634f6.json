Tolkien]] memorabilia and author.\n\nIn [[1978]] Dr. Blackwelder discovered Tolkien, and began amassing a large collection of Tolkieniana, which he sorted and indexed before arranging to donate the collection to the Archives of [[Marquette University]]. The Blackwelder Collection consists of \"ten linear feet of documents in 140 ... three ring binders, ... over 1,200 volumes ... and over 70 theses and dissertations.\" \n\nHe spent four years compiling a concordance to the names of characters, animals, and plants in Tolkien's work, which was published in 1990 by Garland Press as ''[[A Tolkien Thesaurus]]''. A fifteen-page companion booklet, ''[[Tolkien Phraseology]]'', was published by Marquette in 1990.\n\nDuring these years, Blackwelder was actively involved in Tolkien fandom, contributing frequently to the ''[[Beyond Bree]]'' journal.\n\nIn [[2006]], the volume ''[[The Lord of the Rings 1954-2004]]'', was published in honor to Blackwelder.\n\n==Publications==\n*[[1990]]: ''[[A Tolkien Thesaurus]]''.
