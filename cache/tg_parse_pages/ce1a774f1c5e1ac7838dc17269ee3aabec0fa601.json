They appeared during the reign of [[Tar-Atanamir]], the thirteenth [[King of Númenor|King]]. Tar-Atanamir ruled during a time of great upheaval in Númenor; he and most of his people had begun to question the justice of their mortal state and the [[Ban of the Valar]].\n\nThe messengers (it is never said whether they were [[Elves]] or [[Maiar]]) explained to the Númenóreans why they could not sail to the [[Blessed Realm]], and urged them not to spurn the [[Gift of Men]], for this would merely make life harder for them. The Númenóreans asked them many questions about the nature of [[Men]] in return. A part of this converse was later recorded in the ''[[Akallabêth]]''.\n\nIn the end, the greater part of the Númenóreans decided to ignore the advice of the messengers, and drifted away from the friendship of the [[Eldar]] and the Valar. This group became known as the [[King's Men]], for most of the later Kings of Númenor supported their policies. The small number of Númenóreans who did put their [[Estel|trust]] in the messengers' words came to call themselves the [[Faithful]].<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]"}}}
