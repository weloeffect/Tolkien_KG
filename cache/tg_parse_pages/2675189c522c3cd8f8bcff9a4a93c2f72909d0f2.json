Its name was taken from the first words of the [[Doom of Mandos]]: ''\"Tears unnumbered ye shall shed...\"''. The battle was a pivotal moment in the war as the northern power of the [[Elves]] took heavy casualties, allowing Morgoth to exercise his dominance over [[Beleriand]].\n\n==Background==\n{{main|Union of Maedhros}}\nIn the almost two decades since their defeat in the [[Dagor Bragollach]], the [[Noldor]] had lost control over the entire north of Beleriand, and were, for the most part, reduced to refugees dwelling in [[Hithlum]] and [[Nargothrond]]. [[Gondolin]] was shut up and unknown.\n\nIn {{FA|468}},<ref>{{GA|212}}</ref> [[Maedhros]] after hearing the deeds of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] perceived Morgoth was not unassailable and planned to take the offence against [[Angband]] before Morgoth would destroy them all one by one. Thus he set out plans to reunite the foes of Morgoth under a new league, the [[Union of Maedhros]].<ref name=\"NA\" />\n\nUnder this [[Union of Maedhros]] all the [[Elves]] of Beleriand, as well as the [[Edain]], [[Dwarves]], and the newly arrived [[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterlings]] were invited to combine in arms and fight Morgoth. The smithies of [[Nogrod]] and [[Belegost]] were busy preparing weapons and the Easterlings following [[Bór]] and [[Ulfang]] were trained for war. In west Beleriand the [[Noldor]] in [[Hithlum]] prepared as well as the Men of the [[house of Hador]] and [[people of Haleth]]. Tidings of the Union also came to [[Turgon]].<ref name=\"NA\" />\n\nMaedhros' plans were hindered because of the evil deeds of [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]]. [[Orodreth]] the king of Nargothrond refused to participate.  [[Gwindor]] joined the Union, commanding a group of Elves against his will. From [[Doriath]], where [[Thingol]] had sworn never to fight beside any son of Fëanor, came only [[Mablung]] and [[Beleg]], who did not wish to remain behind.<ref group=\"note\">In the ''[[The Grey Annals]]'' Thingol sends a small force of Grey-elves with Mablung, Beleg is not mentioned to have gone to war.</ref><ref name=\"NA\" />\n\nA year later<ref>{{GA|213}}</ref> Maedhros made the first trial of his strength and cleared the northward regions of Beleriand of Orcs and regained much of the land the Elves lost in the Dagor Bragollach.  Even [[Dorthonion]] was freed. Unbeknownst to Maedhros, Ulfang and his followers were in secret league with Morgoth and he was well aware of the plans of the Union from his spies.<ref name=\"NA\" /> Further, emissaries of Morgoth, either [[Spell of Bottomless Dread|enthralled-Noldor]] or things in Elvish form, went among the camps spreading the foreboding of evil and the suspicion of treason among all who would listen to them.<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}</ref>{{rp|§9}}\n\n==Strategy and array==\nThe [[Union of Maedhros]] was divided into two hosts, the western host was commanded by Fingon and the eastern host was commanded by Maedhros.\n\n'''Western Host'''\n*'''[[Fingon]]'''\n**[[Noldor]] of [[Hithlum]]\n**[[Gwindor]]\n***[[Elves of Nargothrond]]\n**Some [[Falathrim]]\n**[[Húrin|Húrin Thalion]] and [[Huor]]\n***[[Men of Dor-lómin]]\n**[[Haldir (Chieftain of the Haladin)|Haldir]]\n***[[Men of Brethil]]\n**[[Mablung]] and [[Beleg]] of [[Doriath]]\n'''Eastern Host'''\n*'''[[Maedhros]]'''\n**[[Fëanorians|Noldor of East Beleriand]]\n**[[Maglor]] (and Maedhros)\n***[[Bór]]\n****[[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterlings]] (faithful)\n**[[Caranthir]]\n***[[Ulfang]]\n****[[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterlings]] (faithless)\n**[[Azaghâl]]\n***[[Dwarves of Belegost]]\n\nThe strategy of the Union was for Maedhros to march in force into [[Anfauglith]], there he hoped Morgoth would respond by sending out his armies to meet the eastern host. The western host would remain hidden in the woods and valleys east of [[Ered Wethrin]] waiting for the firing of a great beacon in [[Dorthonion]]. Upon firing of the beacon Fingon would lead his host and engage the host of Morgoth from the west hoping to break it like hammer and anvil. The western host was reinforced later when [[Turgon]] unexpectedly came forth with ten thousand [[Gondolindrim]].<ref name=\"NA\" />\n\n==History==\n===Prelude===\n{{blockquote|Then When Fingon heard afar the great trumpet of Turgon, the shadow passed and his heart was uplifted, and he shouted aloud: 'Utúlie'n aurë! Aiya Eldalië ar Atanatarni, utúlie'n aurë! The day has come! Behold, people of the Eldar and Fathers of Men, the day has come!' And all those who heard his great voice echo in the hills answered crying: 'Auta i lómë! The night is passing!'|The Children of Húrin, The Battle of Unnumbered Tears}}\n\nOn the morning of Midsummer the trumpets of the Eldar greeted the rising of the sun and hosts of [[Fingon]] and [[Maedhros]] gathered in the west and east. Fingon on the walls of [[Eithel Sirion]] saw his host arrayed, hidden in the woods and he looked to the east and through the dust he saw the glint of steel and indeed Maedhros had set forth into [[Anfauglith]]. A dark cloud gathered about [[Thangorodrim]] and the wrath of Morgoth was aroused and he accepted the challenge. A shadow of doubt fell upon the heart of Fingon then suddenly a cry went up of wonder and joy, as [[Turgon]] had come unsummoned and unlooked for with his host - \"ten thousand strong, with bright mail and long swords and spears like a forest\".<ref name=\"NA\" />\n\nFingon received Turgon's army with the cry ''\"[[Utúlie'n aurë!]]\"'' and they stationed guarding the passes of [[Sirion]] and he became hopeful. Morgoth through his spies had learned of the battle plan, and his treacherous servants had delayed [[Maedhros]]' march to prevent swift union of the two forces.<ref name=\"NA\" />\n\n===Battle===\n[[File:Peter Xavier Price - Gwindor's Charge.jpg|left|thumb|''Gwindor's Charge'' by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]]\nMorgoth then moved forward with his plan, that same hour a host of Orcs sallied forth from [[Angband]] to provoke the western host to attack, and another greater host was sent to meet Maedhros.<ref name=\"UT\" /> The hearts of the Noldor grew restless as the captains wished to assail the Orc-host in the plains, but Fingon forbade this.  He urged caution and for his host to wait for the Orcs to assault the hills.<ref name=\"UT\" /><ref group=\"note\">In ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' this warning was told by [[Húrin]].</ref> Within sight of the [[Ered Wethrin]], [[Gwindor]]'s brother [[Gelmir]], captured during the [[Dagor Bragollach]], was brought forth and brutally slain. Enraged, Gwindor broke ranks and charged along with his men. From their hidden positions in the eastern hills, Fingon's forces suddenly charged along with them. The Orc host was taken by surprise and swiftly defeated, and the sudden charge of Fingon's army nearly foiled Morgoth's plans; the forces of Gwindor and Fingon pushed forth, reaching Angband itself.<ref name=\"NA\" />\n\nMorgoth shook upon his throne as Gwindor's company pounded at his gates above. They burst through, and slew the guards on the steps of Angband itself, though Morgoth had trapped them. They were then ambushed with hidden forces set about Angband; all of Gwindor's company was slain and Gwindor himself was captured. From clandestine gates around Angband, thousands of Orcs erupted suddenly, repulsing the host of Fingon from the walls. The Elven army was driven back in great slaughter, and many [[Haladin]] fell fighting in the rearguard including their lord [[Haldir (Chieftain of the Haladin)|Haldir]].<ref name=\"NA\" />\n\n[[File:Joona Kujanen - The Fall of Azaghal.jpg|thumb|left|''The Fall of Azaghâl'' by [[:Category:Images by Joona Kujanen|Joona Kujanen]]]]\n[[Turgon]], who had withheld his host from the reckless charge, now came upon the Orc host. The phalanx of Turgon broke through the Angband lines, and met with the guard of Fingon.\n\nFinally, Maedhros arrived, but before he could make junction with Fingon and Turgon, Morgoth unleashed his last strength and all of Angband was emptied; wolves, wolfriders, Balrogs, dragons and with them [[Glaurung]]. Union forces could yet have prevailed, but [[Uldor]] turned ranks and attacked Maedhros in the rear, while more of his kin came down from the mountains and attacked from the east. [[Maglor]] slew Uldor in single combat,<ref group=\"note\">In ''[[The Grey Annals]]'' Uldor was slained by Cranthir (Caranthir)</ref> [[Bór]] and his sons slew [[Ulfast]] and [[Ulwarth]] and they themselves were slain, but could not turn the tide of the battle. Under assault from three sides, the eastern host was scattered, and only the valour of the [[Dwarves]] of [[Belegost]] helped them escape, as their lord [[Azaghâl]] and his forces held off Glaurung, allowing the [[sons of Fëanor]] to escape into [[Ossiriand]].<ref name=\"NA\" />\n\n[[Image:Jenny Dolfen - Nirnaeth Arnoediad - Unnumbered Tears.jpg|thumb|right|''Nirnaeth Arnoediad - Unnumbered Tears'' by [[Jenny Dolfen]]]]\n[[Azaghâl]] and his army fought with fierce iron masks on, and they were able to resist the fire far better than any Elf or Man. Then Glaurung trampled Azaghâl beneath his feet, but Azaghâl ran a dagger through Glaurung's stomach, and the dragon fled in pain.  Many beasts retreated with him. In a solemn ceremony, the Dwarves picked up their fallen leader, abandoning the battle, and marched him home in a great procession. Their wrath was so great that none troubled them.<ref name=\"NA\" />\n\nAll this had not helped the western host, who were attacked by many Orcs under [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]]. Gothmog cut a path to Fingon and fought him in single combat. After another Balrog bound him with a whip, Fingon was hewed by Gothmog's black axe and his body was beaten with maces. [[Húrin]] begged Turgon to retreat back to Gondolin, knowing now he was the last of the [[House of Fingolfin]] and Gondolin still remained hidden so Morgoth would still know fear in his heart. [[Huor]] then said to the king that from his house the hope of Elves and Men will come and 'from me and you a new star shall arise.' Huor and Húrin and the remaining [[Men of Dor-lómin]] formed a living wall across the [[Fen of Serech]], buying time for Turgon to escape with what remained of the Elves of Gondolin and Fingon's host. Acting as a rearguard, these Men were almost all slain &ndash; Huor fell when his eye was pierced by a poisoned arrow. His brother Húrin fought ferociously to buy his allies time to escape, fighting until his axe withered away. Morgoth had ordered him to be taken alive, however; he killed no fewer than seventy Orcs<ref group=\"note\">In ''[[The Grey Annals]]'' it was a hundred Orcs</ref> and Trolls before he became pinned under their corpses, and was later taken prisoner by Gothmog.<ref name=\"NA\" />\n\n===Aftermath===\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Hill of Slain.jpg|thumb|''The Hill of Slain'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nThe Orcs gathered all of the slain Elves and Men and piled them in a mound in the midst of the desolate landscape and it was so great it could be seen from afar, and the Elves named it [[Haudh-en-Nirnaeth]], Hill of Tears or Haudh-en-Ndengin, Hill of the Slain. Grass grew on that hill long after the battle but nowhere else in Anfauglith and no servant of Morgoth would go near it.<ref name=\"NA\" />\n\nMorgoth now had complete dominance in the north and his servants pressed southwards whenever. Morgoth sent the Easterlings that served him into Hithlum and shut them in and denied to them the fertile lands of [[Beleriand]]. The Easterlings plundered and harassed the women, children and old of Hador's people and what remnant of Elves still in Hithlum was sent to the mines of Angband. In the east the sons of Fëanor were scattered and they retreated to the woods and mountains and Himring was occupied by the Orcs. A year later Morgoth [[Fall of the Falas|sacked the havens]] of the [[Falas]].<ref name=\"NA\" />\n\nMorgoth's destruction was not entirely complete, however, for Turgon, now [[High King of the Noldor]] after the death of Fingon, had evaded capture, and his city Gondolin was still unknown to Morgoth. [[Doriath]] and [[Nargothrond]] still remained.<ref name=\"NA\" />\n\n==Etymology==\n''Nirnaeth ''(or ''Nírnaeth'')'' Arnoediad ''(or ''Arnediad'') is [[Sindarin]] for \"Tears Uncountable\".<ref>{{WJ|Index}}</ref><ref>{{S|Index}}</ref>\n\nNote that the \"oe\" of \"Arnoediad\" is not the Sindarin diphthong \"oe\", but rather the single [[i-affection|umlaut]] vowel \"œ\", better represented with a ligature.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry \"NOT\"</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nThe earliest concept of the battle appears in ''[[Gilfanon's Tale]]'' and is named the '''Battle of Unnumbered Tears'''.

This division was mainly due to strategy employed by the leaders, a hammer and anvil tactic to encircle and destroy the host of [[Morgoth]]. In the ''[[Sketch of the Mythology]]'' the division is caused because the Fëanorians refuse to be led by [[Fingon|Finweg]] (Fingon) thus the host is divided and the other is led by [[Maidros]] and [[Maglor]].<ref name=\"S\">{{SM|2}}</ref> This animosity between the two factions was changed later to have them more friendly and cooperative. This is part of the frequent revisions that Tolkien made of the composition and allegiances of the armies:\n*In the earlier drafts the Dwarves of [[Belegost]] and [[Nogrod]] do not participate in the battle but instead help arm the eastern host as well as 'many armies' - their \"smithies were busy in those days\".<ref name=\"Q11\">{{SM|Q11}}</ref><ref name=\"QS\">{{LR|P2VI}}</ref> The Dwarves were more concerned with war profiteering than fighting,<ref>{{GA|212|note}}</ref> it is said that they gained much \"wealth and jewelry of Elves and Men\", and they \"did not favour either side\".<ref group=\"note\">This line is different depending on which draft you read. In the ''[[Quenta]]'': 'For we do not know the rights of this quarrel,' they[Dwarves] said 'and we are friends of neither side-until it hath the mastery.' In the ''[[Quenta Silmarillion (Lost Road)|Quenta Silmarillion]]'': 'For we do not know the right causes of this quarrel,' they[Dwarves] said, 'and we favour neither side-until one hath the mastery.'</ref> This is from the earlier view of the Dwarves that they were neutral and so inclined to deal with the servants of Morgoth.<ref>{{LT2|IV}}</ref> The ''[[Sketch of the Mythology|Sketch]]'' mentions that the Fëanorians made war upon them but this was later changed to converse.<ref name=\"S\" /> In the later writings Tolkien made the Dwarves 'less evil' and they now participate in the battle and the Dwarves of Belegost were able to hold their ground against the brood of [[Glaurung]] and their lord [[Azaghâl]] wounds Glaurung.<ref>{{GA|232}}</ref> This is incorporated in ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.\n*In the ''[[Sketch of the Mythology|Sketch]]'' and ''[[Quenta]]'' (as originally written) Turgon is already with Finweg in [[Hithlum]] and is one of the commanders of the western host. When they are defeated Turgon flees with the remnant of the Gnomes down [[Sirion]] thanks to the heroics of [[Húrin]] and [[Huor]]. It is here that their scouts discover the [[Tumladen|valley]] encircled by the mountains and establish [[Gondolin]].<ref name=\"S\" /><ref>{{SM|Q15}}</ref> In the ''Quenta'' there was a change and it had Turgon coming forth 'unlooked for' with a great host, which would mean that Gondolin was already established before the battle.<ref name=\"Q11\" /> The foundation of Gondolin occurring before the battle remained in later writings.\n*In ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' [[Thingol]] did not send any of his people to war save only [[Mablung]] and [[Beleg]].<ref name=\"NA\" /> In the ''Sketch'' Thingol does indeed send help and allows the 'Gnomes of Doriath' to join the Union and a 'few from [[Doriath]]'. These Gnomes were refugees when Morgoth broke the [[Siege of Angband]] and they arrived to Doriath to take service to Thingol and [[Melian]].<ref name=\"S\" /> This element originates from ''[[The Tale of Tinúviel]]'' where some Noldoli are in Tinwelint's service.<ref>{{LT2|I}}</ref> In another version Thingol sends Mablung and a small force of Grey-elves.<ref>{{GA|221}}</ref>\n*In the earlier drafts Maidros' host consist of Men, Gnomes and [[Ilkorins]] or Dark-elves.<ref name=\"S\" /> The Ilkorins were an early name for [[Úmanyar]]. The Dark-elves answer the summons of Maidros but they are not from Doriath<ref name=\"Q11\" /> but from the south,<ref name=\"QS\" /> where they fled after Morgoth broke the [[Siege of Angband]].<ref>{{SM|Q9}}</ref> Furthermore the [[Green-elves]] of [[Ossiriand]] join Maidros in the battle.<ref name=\"QS\" /> The explicit mention of Dark-elves and Green-elves joining the battle disappeared in the latest writings which is most likely due to keeping consistency of the story, Thingol refusing to help and the Green-elves refusing to go to war after the death of their leader. In ''The Silmarillion'' it states Maedhros gathered all the strength of Elves, Men and Dwarves.\n\nIn ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' Morgoth plans to send a decoy force to draw out Fingon, which succeeds due to the dismembering of the prisoner [[Gelmir (son of Guilin)|Gelmir]]. However this element plays out differently in early drafts, for instance in the ''Sketch'' it has Finweg's host advance into Dor-na-Fauglith ([[Anfauglith]]) and they defeat an Orc host, they pursue them only to fight against a greater host when they reach Angband. There is no prisoner but the element of Finweg fighting two hosts in the opening stages remained in later writings.<ref>{{SM|2a}}</ref> This is further developed in the ''Quenta'', Finweg does not advance nor is their any Orc host present, but Finweg send heralds to Angband to summon the hosts of Morgoth, Morgoth replies by sending a host out with a captured herald and they slew him in front of Finweg which provokes him and the entire host to charge.<ref name=\"Q11\" /> Notice that it is Finweg that is provoked by the slewing of the herald, this later changes to [[Gwindor]], who was also present in the battle but is named Flinding. The use of the heralds was abandoned in later writings,<ref>{{SM|CQ11}}</ref> so the role was replaced by Gelmir who was now in the later writings the brother of Gwindor.\n\n[[Turgon]] was originally already in [[Hithlum]], however this was altered when Tolkien had [[Gondolin]] already existing before the battle so Turgon would arrive later on the day onlooked.<ref name=\"Q11\" /> In the ''[[The Earliest Annals of Beleriand|Annals of Beleriand]]'' there is different version of events where Turgon does not arrive to take part in preparation near Hithlum, instead he emerges from [[Taur-na-Fuin]] unlooked for and engages the Orcs that were driving back Fingon's host.<ref>{{SM|7I}}</ref>\n\nThe battle was originally the third Battle of the [[Wars of Beleriand]] but was replaced by the [[Dagor Bragollach]] and it became the fourth battle<ref>{{SM|Index}}</ref> and then eventually to the fifth battle.\n\nThe Elvish name went through many changes in Tolkien's writings. In the stories of the ''[[Lost Tales]]'' it appeared as [[Gnomish]] '''Nínin-Udathriol''' or [[Qenya]] '''Nieriltasinwa'''.<ref>{{LT2|Appendix}}</ref> Later revised to '''Nínin Unothradin''' or '''Nirnaithos Unothradin''',<ref>{{LB|1a}}</ref> and again later to '''Nirnaith Únoth''' then to '''Nirnaith Ornoth'''<ref>{{LB|1d}}</ref> in the ''[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]''. In the drafts it appeared as '''Nirnaith Irnoth''' then changed to '''Nirnaith Dirnoth'''<ref>{{SM|7In}}</ref> There was another variant '''Dagor Nirnaith'''.<ref>{{LR|A2}}</ref> '''Nírnaith Arnediad''' was the name of the battle in the ''[[Quenta Silmarillion (Lost Road)|Quenta Silmarillion]]'' which had another variant '''Nírnaeth Arnediad''' (or Aronoded).<ref>{{LR|P3}}</ref> The final form was now '''Nirnaeth Arnoediad''', which had another variant '''Dagor Arnediad'''<ref>{{WJ|P1}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[:Category:Images of Nirnaeth Arnoediad|Images of Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]\n\n{{references|n}}\n{{warsofbeleriand}}\n[[Category:Conflicts in The Book of Lost Tales]]\n[[Category:Conflicts of the First Age]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n[[de:Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]\n[[fr:encyclo/evenements/1a/guerres/nirnaeth arnoediad]]\n[[fi:Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]"}}}
