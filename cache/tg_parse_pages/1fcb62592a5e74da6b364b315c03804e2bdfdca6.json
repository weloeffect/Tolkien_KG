Tolkien’s [[The Lord of the Rings]] and create their own version of the dramatic conflict between the Dark Lord, [[Sauron]], and the [[Free Peoples]] of Middle-earth.\n\nIn War of the Ring - The Card Game, up to 4 players compete in two teams, the Shadow against the Free Peoples, each player using a specific and different card deck representing the strengths and weaknesses of the different factions involved in the war.\n\nThe Free Peoples desperately try to complete their quest to destroy the [[One Ring]], while at the same time defending their homelands from the encroaching hordes of Sauron and from his evil allies. The Shadow players must strike quickly and decisively, before the [[Ring-bearers]] can complete their quest; or try to slowly corrupt [[Frodo]], burdening him with wounds, toil, and the sorrow for the loss of his Companions.\n\n==Expansions==\n*''Against the Shadow'' (2023) - Adds a co-operative and solo mode to the game, enabling the player to take on an automated Shadow player. ([https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/388470/war-of-the-ring-the-card-game-against-the-shadow BGG Profile])\n*''Fire and Swords'' (2024) - Expands the card pool with new battlegrounds, introduces new factions, skirmishes as well as unique Scenarios that can be undertaken.
