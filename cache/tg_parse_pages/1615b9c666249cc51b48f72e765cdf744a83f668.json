The song is formed around the phrase, uttered by [[Legolas]], \"They're taking the Hobbits to Isengard\". This line is spoken in ''The Two Towers'', when Legolas spots the [[Uruk-hai]] and extrapolates their objective from the direction in which they run. It should be noted that Legolas states the Uruks turned north-east - a direction which would not lead them to Isengard, but straight back at the pursuers. The actual direction should be north-west.\n\nThe lyrics are scrambled lines from Legolas, [[Gollum]] and [[Celeborn]]. Footage of [[Frodo Baggins]], [[Peregrin Took]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]], [[Aragorn]], [[Gimli]], [[Galadriel]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]] is also shown. The music is a computerized mix of two themes of [[Howard Shore]]'s music; \"[[The Shire (soundtrack)|The Shire]]\" theme and \"[[The Ring Goes South (soundtrack)|The Ring Goes South]]\" theme.\n\n==Lyrics==\n<poem>\n'''[[Legolas]]''': They're taking the [[Hobbits]] to [[Isengard]]!\nThey're taking the [[Hobbits]] to [[Isengard]]!\nThey're taking the [[Hobbits]] to [[Isengard]]!\nThey're taking the [[Hobbits]] to [[Isengard]]!\nThey're taking the [[Hobbits]] to [[Isengard]]!\nThey're taking the [[Hobbits]] to [[Isengard]]!\nThey're taking the [[Hobbits]] to [[Isengard|Isengard-gard-gard-gard-gard]]!\nThey're taking the [[Hobbits]] to [[Isengard|Isengard-gard-gard-gardgard-gard]]!\nThey're taking the [[Hobbits]] to [[Isengard]]!\nThey're taking the [[Hobbits]] to [[Isengard]]!\nThey're taking the [[Hobbits]] to [[Isengard]]!\n'''[[Gollum]]''': What did you say?\nThe [[Hobbits]]-The [[Hobbits]]-The [[Hobbits]]-The [[Hobbits]] to [[Isengard]]!
