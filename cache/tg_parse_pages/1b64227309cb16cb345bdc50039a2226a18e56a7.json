Indeed it was believed among the Dwarves that he was the reincarnation of Durin I, though whether this is possible is unclear.<ref name=\"Durin\"/>\n\nDuring his reign in the 16th century of the Second Age, the [[Dwarves of Khazad-dûm]] had struck a rare friendship with the [[Elves of Eregion]].  Around {{SA|1500}}, the Elves, guided by [[Annatar]], began forging the [[Rings of Power]].<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref> According to the Dwarves, [[Celebrimbor]] and the Elven-smiths gave Durin the first of the [[Seven Rings]] of the Dwarves (other traditions state that [[Celebrimbor]] was said to have yielded the Seven - all the Seven - to [[Sauron]] after torture and it was Sauron who gifted the ring to Durin).<ref name=\"Durin\">{{App|Durin}}</ref>\n\nTheir instructor in crafting the Rings, the wise [[Annatar]], was actually [[Sauron]] who had come to corrupt the Elves through the Rings of Power. By {{SA|1697}}, seeing that he could not control either the Elves nor the Dwarves through the Rings, he led a large army towards Eregion. In response, Durin sent a great force of Dwarves to the aid of [[Celebrimbor]], but with the [[Sack of Eregion|fall of Eregion]], his warriors were driven back and the [[Doors of Durin]] were shut. Their actions were not in vain for it was by the aid of Durin that [[Elrond]] was able to escape and establish the refuge of [[Imladris]] in the North.<ref name=\"Galadriel\">{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>\n\nSauron's assault on Eregion was only the beginning of his campaign of conquest. His servants also invaded [[Gundabad]] and the [[Ered Mithrin]], cutting off communications between Durin III and the [[Iron Hills]]. Consequently, the [[Alliance of Dwarves and Men]] came to an end during his reign.<ref name=relations>{{PM|Relations}}</ref>  Although [[Eregion]] was conquered, Durin III's people were too numerous and valiant, and his halls too deep and strong, to be taken by Sauron.<ref name=\"Durin\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nOne account states that the name ''Durin ''was a word for \"king\" in the language of the [[Men of the North]] in the early [[Second Age]].<ref name=relations>{{PM|Relations}}</ref> \n\nAnother account states that ''Durinn'' is one of the Dwarfs in the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. The name means \"Sleepy\".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, \"Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion\", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| DU1 | |DU1=[[Durin|Durin I]]<br /><small>''fl.
