The first [[Hobbits]] (mostly [[Fallohides]] and [[Harfoots]]) came there from the east in about {{TA|1300}} fleeing [[Angmar]].<ref name=\"TA\">{{App|TA}}</ref><ref name=\"hob\">{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref> This made Bree the only place in the [[Arda|world]] where Hobbits and Men lived together side by side. Most of the Hobbits of the Bree-land lived in [[Staddle]], a village on the southeastern slopes of the [[Bree-hill]], but some also dwelt in Bree itself, living in [[Hobbit-holes]] burrowed in the hill above the houses of Men.\n\nIt was where and when the Hobbits (who by that time were speaking a language probably related to that of the [[Éothéod]]<ref>{{FR|Records}}</ref>) adopted the [[Westron]] tongue; they also learned literacy with the [[Tengwar]], in the fashion of the [[Dúnedain of Arnor]].<ref name=\"hob\" /> The Hobbits of Bree claimed to have originated most Hobbit customs, and certainly it was thought that they were the ones who first discovered the [[smoking]] properties of [[pipe-weed]].<ref name=\":0\">{{FR|Pipeweed}}</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|1601}} two Fallohides, [[Marcho]] and [[Blanco]] with permission from King [[Argeleb II]] of [[Arnor]] led a group of colonists from Bree westward across [[Baranduin]] and founded [[the Shire]].<ref name=\"TA\" /><sup>,</sup><ref name=\"hob\" /> The Bree-hobbits, therefore, tended to look down somewhat on their cousins in the Shire, referring to them as 'Colonists'<ref name=\":0\" /> and 'Outsiders'.<ref name=\":1\" /> On the other hand, the [[Shire-hobbits]] considered Bree-hobbits as [[Outsiders]] and thought of them as dull and rustic.\n\nAt the end of the Third Age, the Bree-hobbits still occasionally travelled west to the Shire, but they rarely ventured further than [[Buckland]] or the [[Eastfarthing]], those parts of the Shire that were closest to their home.<ref name=\":1\" /> However ancient close relationships between Bree-land and the Shire were not completely forgotten. [[Brandybuck family|Brandybucks]] had Bree-blood in them<ref name=\":1\" />, and [[Briffo Boffin]] moved from the Shire to Bree-land in [[Third Age 2810|T.A. 2810.]]<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Appendix C]], \"Boffin of the Yale\"</ref>\n\nDuring the [[War of the Ring]] two hobbits, [[Bob]] and [[Nob]] worked at the ''[[Prancing Pony]]''. When the [[Travelers]] entered the common room of the inn, they associated with native hobbits and travelers.<ref name=\":1\">{{FR|I9}}</ref>\n\n==Families==\nThe more prominent Hobbit families living in the Bree-land at the time of the [[War of the Ring]] were [[Banks Family|Banks]], [[Brockhouse Family|Brockhouse]], [[Longholes Family|Longholes]], [[Mugwort Family|Mugwort]], [[Sandheaver Family|Sandheaver]], [[Tunnelly Family|Tunnelly]] and [[Underhill Family|Underhill]]. \n\nThere were also hobbits by the name of Banks living in the Shire, and [[Underhill (village)|Underhill]] was a hamlet of Hobbiton, but we can do no more than speculate on the links between these families and regions.\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Hobbits]]\n\n[[de:Bree-Hobbits]]\n[[Category:Bree-land]]"}}}
