She supervised the work of Tevildo's scullions.<ref name=tales/>\n\nUpon meeting [[Beren]] for the first time, Tevildo made him a scullion under the supervision of Miaulë after Beren failed a difficult test. Miaulë's supervision over him was miserable enough that Beren eventually wished that he never saw [[Lúthien|Tinúviel]].<ref name=tales/>\n\nSome time later, when [[Umuiyan]] led Tinúviel up the cliff, Tevildo brought her to a dining chamber next to the great kitchens of his halls. Tinúviel was able to catch a glimpse of Beren and many cats, likely including Miaulë. When Tinúviel began talking to Tevildo, her voice was heard by Beren, causing him to accidentally drop an unspecified amount of metal and earthware vessels. Miaulë gave him sound scratches as a punishment.<ref name=tales/>\n\nAn hour later, after the death of [[Oikeroi]] in the [[Withered Dale]], Tevildo tells [[Huan]] that Beren was likely being punished with Miaulë's scratches, due to the incident earlier.<ref name=tales/>\n\nThe ultimate fate of Miaulë is not known.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[Gnomish]]<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1837576267.html|articlename=Miaulë|dated=|website=Eldamo|accessed=}}</ref> name ''Miaulë'' is described by [[Christopher Tolkien]] alongside ''Miaugion'' and ''Meoita'' as \"engagingly [[Elvish]]-feline names\".<ref>{{LT2|In}}, p. 54</ref> It is, according to [[Patrick H.
