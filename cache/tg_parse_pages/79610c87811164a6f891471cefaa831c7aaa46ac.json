It was so called because the light of the [[Two Trees]] came through the pass and lit [[Eldamar]], and it is said that many jewels were embedded in the rocks of its wall.<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, p. 73</ref>\n\nAfter the hiding of [[Valinor]] this was the lone gap through the mountains of [[Aman]]. The [[Valar]] would have closed the mountains entirely but, realizing that the Elves, even the [[Vanyar]], needed to be able to breathe the outside air and see the stars, they kept Calacirya open. They also did not want to wholly separate the Vanyar and Noldor from the [[Teleri]] on the coast.<ref>{{S|11}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Calacirya'' literally means \"Light-cleft\" in [[Quenya]]<ref name=PE17/> (from ''[[cala]]'' = \"light\" and ''[[cilya]]'' = \"cleft, gorge\"). Variant names used by Tolkien were ''Kalakirya'' and ''Kalakilya'' (early forms), and ''Kalakiryan'' and ''Calaciryan'' (later forms).<ref>{{HM|MR}}, pp. 183, 452</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Passes]]\n[[Category:Aman]]\n[[Category:Quenya locations]]\n\n[[de:Calacirya]]\n[[fi:Calacirya]]\n[[fr:encyclo:geographie:reliefs:aman:calacirya]]"}}}
