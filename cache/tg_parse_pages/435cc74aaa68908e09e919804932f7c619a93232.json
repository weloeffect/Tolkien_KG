It then turned and encircled the mountain from its southern side, over its western and northern side back to a dark door, the door of the [[Sammath Naur]], in the eastern side of the mountain high up on the cone, but still far from the summit of the mountain.<ref name=Doom>{{RK|Doom}}, pp. 940-4</ref>\n\nSauron's Road was broad and paved with beaten ash and broken rubble. It was often blocked or destroyed by the tumults of the mountain, but was cleared and repaired by large teams of [[Orcs]]. On the inside of the door in the mountain's side a long cave or tunnel led into the mountain's smoking cone. After a short distance the floor and the walls were cut by a great fissure, the Crack of Doom in the Sammath Naur.<ref name=Doom/>\n\n== History ==\nOn [[25 March]] {{TA|3019}} [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]]<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019, March 25, p. 1094</ref> reached the northern side of Mount Doom, Sam carried Frodo on his back up its slope until he reached the road and then along the road to the door in the eastern side of the mountain.<ref name=Doom/> After the destruction of [[The One Ring]] they went on the road down the mountain until they could go no further.<ref>{{RK|Cormallen}}, p. 950</ref> \n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2017: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Sauron's Road has been wrecked by the eruption of [[Mount Doom]].
