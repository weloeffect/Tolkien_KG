Fimbul was invented by [[Warner Bros.]] for [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]], where he was portrayed by [[Stephen Ure]], who also portrayed [[Grinnah]].\n\n== History ==\nWhen Azog had [[Yazneg]] killed for his failure to catch [[Thorin]] and his [[Thorin and Company|Company]] as they headed toward [[Rivendell]], Fimbul became Azog's new lieutenant.<ref>''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]''</ref> Once [[Bolg]] took over the leadership of the pack when Azog was summoned back to [[Dol Guldur]] by the [[Sauron|Necromancer]], Fimbul continued to serve as lieutenant. When the pack finally caught up to the Company again in [[Lake-town]], he was the one who notified Bolg that Thorin and most of the Company had already gone. Almost immediately after that, a slain Orc fell into the boat that Fimbul was sitting in at that moment, launching him into the air, where he was then decapitated by [[Legolas]], who happened to be on the balcony of [[Bard|Bard's]] house at that very moment.<ref>''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]''</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\nHis name is old norse for \"great\" or \"mighty\".<ref>https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fimbul-</ref> It could also be a reference to [[Golfimbul]].\n\n{{References}}\n\n[[Category:Orcs from adaptations]]\n[[Category:The Hobbit (film series) characters]]\n\n[[fi:Fimbul (elokuvahahmo)]]"}}}
