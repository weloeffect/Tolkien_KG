When these were destroyed by [[Morgoth]] and [[Ungoliant]], [[Arda]] was plunged into darkness. Through the power of [[Varda]] and [[Yavanna]], though, [[Laurelin]] produced a single fiery fruit before it died. This golden fire was set in a vessel made by [[Aulë]] and his people, and steered into the sky by the [[Maiar|Maia]] [[Arien]].<ref name=OfSun>{{S|11}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Ted Nasmith - The First Dawn of the Sun.jpg|200px|thumb|''The First Dawn of the Sun'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\n[[Valinor]] was in the West of the World, and so the first sunrise was in the west, not the east. Originally, [[Arien]] was to have steered Anar ceaselessly from west to east and back again, always remaining in the sky, but the [[Valar]] changed this counsel, so that each evening Anar would descend into the distant western seas, and re-emerge each morning in the east.<ref name=OfSun/>\n\nThe Sun was seen by the Elves as a sign for the awakening of [[Men]], and they valued the [[Moon]] higher.<ref name=OfSun/> [[Morgoth]]'s creatures, the [[Orcs]], feared the Sun, and with the exception of the [[Uruk-hai]], they did not travel while it was in the sky.\n\nThe [[Trolls]] of [[Middle-earth]] feared the Sun even more, and with great reason: they turned to stone under its light. Only the later [[Olog-hai]] were able to move under the Sun.\n\n==Other names==\n:''For the [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] see [[Anar (dwarf)]]''\nNames of the Sun amongst the [[Elves]] included:\n*'''''Anar''''' (derived from the [[Sundocarmë|root]] [[ANÁR]]<ref name=LR>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 348</ref>) or '''The Fire-golden''',<ref name=OfSun/> a name given to it by the [[Vanyar]].\n*'''''Anor''''' (derived from the [[Sundocarmë|root]] [[ANÁR]]<ref name=LR/>), the common name in [[Sindarin]], as seen in ''[[Minas Anor]]'', the [[Gondor]]ian province of [[Anórien]], and ''[[elanor]]'' (\"Sun-star\").\n*'''''Vása''''' (\"the Consumer\"<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref>), or '''Heart of Fire''', a name given by the [[Noldor]] as it marked the waning of the Elves.<ref name=OfSun/>\n*'''''Aþâraigas''''' (\"appointed heat\"), its in [[Valarin]].<ref>{{WJ|AD1}}, p. 401</ref>\n*'''''Kalantar''''' (\"Light-giver\").<ref>{{NM|P3i}}, p. 280</ref>\n*'''''Ūri''''', is one of the [[Adûnaic]] words for the sun, giving the \"later\" forms ([[Westron]]?)

It was also said there that the youth [[Tilion]], who guided the Moon, was said to secretly be in love with Arien, and that because he steered the Moon too close to the Sun the Moon was burned.\n\nIn some early versions of ''The Silmarillion'', it is prophecised that in [[the End]] Morgoth will destroy the Sun and Moon.<ref>{{SM|CQ19}}, p. 205</ref><ref>{{LR|P2VI}}, p. 333</ref>\n\nIn an unwritten revision of the Silmarillion, Morgoth at one point was infatuated with Arien, and wanted to claim her as his wife: he is at one point even described as ravishing her, so she abandoned her body and 'died': the Sun after this for a while left its course, burning a large part of [[Arda]] the world (apparently creating the deserts of Far [[Harad]]).<ref>{{MR|P5II}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Round World version of the Silmarillion|Round World]] version of the legendarium, the Sun and the Moon were not the fruit of the Two Trees, but actually preceded the creation of the Trees.
