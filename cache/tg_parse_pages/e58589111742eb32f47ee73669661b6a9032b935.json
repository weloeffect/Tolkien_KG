It ran westward past [[Minas Morgul]] until it reached the [[Cross-roads]] in [[Ithilien]], where its course turned southwest until it entered the [[Anduin]] just south of [[Osgiliath]].

The corruption of the river is unmistakable along its course, even after it flows out of the [[Morgul Vale]] into [[Ithilien]], with only the mighty current of the [[Anduin]] itself able to safely dillute the poisoned waters.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Gondor]]\n[[Category:Mordor]]\n[[Category:Rivers]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]"}}}
