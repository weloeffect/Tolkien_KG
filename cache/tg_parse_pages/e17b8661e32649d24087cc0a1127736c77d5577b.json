It was retrieved from the hoard of the dragon [[Smaug]], and given to [[Bilbo Baggins]] by [[Thorin]].<ref>{{H|Home}}</ref> \n\nA \"kingly gift\" (in [[Gimli]]'s estimation), the Mithril-coat was worth more than the entire worth of the Shire.<ref name=\"Journey\">{{FR|Journey}}, p. 317</ref> Bilbo kept it as decoration in [[Bag End]]. He later lent it to [[Mathom-house]] museum in [[Michel Delving]],<ref>{{FR|Finding}}, p. 13</ref><ref>{{H|Stage}}</ref> but he took it back before leaving the [[Shire]] for [[Rivendell]]. [[Third Age 3018|Years later]], he gave it to his nephew [[Frodo Baggins]] in [[Rivendell]].<ref>{{FR|South}}, p. 277</ref> Frodo wore it during the [[Quest of the Ring|Quest]] to [[Mount Doom]]. It saved Frodo several times; the first when he was nearly skewered by the spear of an [[Orcs|Orc]] in the Mines of Moria,<ref>{{FR|Bridge}}, p. 325</ref> again shortly before crossing the Bridge of Khazad-dûm,<ref>{{FR|Bridge}}, p. 329</ref> and a third time when he was struck by an arrow while on the river [[Anduin]].<ref>{{FR|River}}, p. 386</ref> \n\nThe Mithril-coat was later taken by the Orcs who captured Frodo in the pass above [[Cirith Ungol]],<ref>{{RK|Tower}}, p. 905</ref> and it was passed on to the Dark Lord's servants at [[Barad-dûr]]. When the coat was displayed before the hosts of [[Aragorn]] at the Gates of Mordor, many despaired, thinking Frodo had been captured or killed, and the Ring taken.<ref name=\"Gate\">{{RK|Gate}}, p. 889</ref> Gandalf reclaimed it from Sauron's lieutenant<ref name=\"Gate\" /> and was later able to return it to Frodo after the battles were won.<ref>{{RK|Cormallen}}, p. 954</ref> After the [[Battle of Bywater]], the coat once again saved Frodo's life when [[Saruman]] attempted to assassinate him at [[Bag End]].<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}, p. 1019</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn the original editions of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', Bilbo's mail was of \"silvered steel\". It was altered to ''mithril'' in a [[1966]] revision.<ref>{{HH|While}}, (ii) ''The Arkenstone as Silmaril'', note 13</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nIn the ''[[wikipedia:Hervarar Saga|Hervarar saga]]'', which was a cycle dealing with the magic sword ''Tyrfing'' (and from which Tolkien borrowed, for instance, the names [[Dwalin]] and [[Durin]]), the hero Orvar-Odd wore a ''silken mailcoat'' which nothing could pierce (''Oddr svarar: \"ek vil berjask við Angantýr, hann mun gefa stór högg með Tyrfingi, en ek trúi betr skyrtu minni, enn brynju þinni, til hlífðar\"'').\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring - Mithril vest.jpg|thumb|The coat as depicted in the movies]]\n'''2001-2003: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]]'''\n:The Mithril-coat follows closely the same narrative, save it is not shown after Frodo's recovery.\n\n'''2014: [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|''The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies'']]:'''\n:Thorin gifts Bilbo with the Mithril-coat as the dwarves are preparing for battle against the elves and Men of Dale.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Armor]]\n[[de:Mithril-Hemd]]\n[[fi:Bilbon mithril-paita]]"}}}
