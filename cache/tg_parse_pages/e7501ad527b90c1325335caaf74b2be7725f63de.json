Yavanna sang and Nienna wept, but to little avail until at last [[Telperion]] bore one silver flower and [[Laurelin]] a single golden fruit. These Yavanna took and gave to [[Aulë]]. Manwë hallowed them and Aulë and his people made vessels to hold them and preserve their radiance. [[Varda]] then took the vessels and gave them the power to traverse the lower regions of [[Ilmen]].<ref>{{S|Sun}}</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nThe ''[[Quenta Noldorinwa]]'' mentions \"the song of the Sun and Moon\".<ref>{{SM|Q6}}, p. 97</ref> [[Christopher Tolkien]] explains that if his father ever wrote such poem, it has dissapeared.<ref>{{SM|CQ6}}, p. 170</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nIn [[Quenya]], ''[[Narsil#Etymology|Narsil]]'' means \"[[Sun]] and [[Moon]]\", derived from ''[[Anar]]'' (\"sun\") and ''[[Moon#Other names|Isil]]'' (\"moon\"), and the ''–ion'' suffix indicates the plural genitive. Thus in full ''Narsilion'' means \"Of the Sun and the Moon\".\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Lays and tales within the legendarium]]\n[[Category:Quenya names]]\n[[de:Narsilion]]\n[[fi:Narsilion]]\n[[fr:encyclo/arts/chants et recits/narsilion]]"}}}
