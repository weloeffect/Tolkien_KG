It crosses Morgulduin at the \"Gúliant\" bridge, which is destroyed by [[Gandalf]] during the passage of the [[Army of the West]] to make any surpsise assault by the Enemy more difficult. After passing [[Minas Morgul]], the road begins to climb high into the valley and eventually crosses back onto the northern shore of Morgulduin by a smaller, unnamed bridge. At the [[Morgul Pass]] the road is guarded by a great gate \"Fennas Gost\". It the begins to descend down into the valley of \"Lhingris\" in the [[Plateau of Gorgoroth]] and crosses over to the [[Morgai]] by a great bridge \"Iant Angos\". The road eventually arrives into the plain of \"Talath Urui\" where it splits into two arms: going north and east of the [[Mount Doom]], both eventually lead to [[Barad-dûr]].\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Gondor]]\n[[Category:Mordor]]\n[[Category:Roads and streets]]"}}}
