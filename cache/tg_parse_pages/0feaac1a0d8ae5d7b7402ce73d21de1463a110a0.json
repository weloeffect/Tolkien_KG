But they would not harm nor come near the home of Húrin, for they felt [[Morwen]] was a power in her own right and also they were afraid of the mountains within which the house was set, for they felt they were the haunt of the [[Elves]].\n[[File:Alan Lee - The Departure of Túrin.jpg|left|thumb|''The Departure of Túrin'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]\nMorwen now remembered her husband's advice ''\"Go swiftly!\"'' but she would not follow his wish; for she was now with child and felt she must await her husband's return. Instead she tarried, and many months passed before she sent her son, [[Túrin]], away to [[Elves|Elven]] [[Doriath]] in [[Beleriand]] for fear of him being captured by the Easterlings and so placed in servitude.\n\nThis parting was a great sorrow to Túrin. [[Gethron]] and [[Grithnir]], old soldiers of Húrin's house, took Túrin and they escaped by way of a secret pass over the [[Shadowy Mountains]] and came down into Beleriand and finally to Doriath, the Kingdom of [[Thingol]] and [[Melian]] with the help of [[Beleg]] the Strongbow.\n\nThe halls of [[Menegroth]] in the heart of Doriath were a wonder for young Tùrin and there Thingol took him as a foster son and granted him arms and shelter, for well renowned was the name of Húrin. Even though word was sent back to Morwen that her son was safe and that she might come to Doriath, she would not leave Dor-lómin – her newborn child, [[Nienor|Niënor]], Túrin's sister, was but an infant and she remained faithful to Húrin. \n\nTúrin's second sorrow was when he heard that his mother was to remain in Dor-lómin; but in her stead she sent to Túrin the dragon-crested [[Helm of Hador]], wrought by [[Telchar]], as the heirloom of their house.\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Departure of Turin}}\n[[Category:The Children of Húrin chapters]]\n[[fi:Túrinin lähtö (HLT)]]"}}}
