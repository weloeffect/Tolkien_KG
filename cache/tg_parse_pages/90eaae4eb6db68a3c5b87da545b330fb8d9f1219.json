For the moment they are hanging back, but there is something else there.  A great cave-troll, I think, or more than one. There is no hope of escape that way.|[[Gandalf]], ''[[The Bridge of Khazad-dûm]]''}}\nWhen the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] explored the [[Chamber of Mazarbul]] in [[Moria]], [[Gandalf]] mentioned that he had seen one or more '''cave-trolls''' in the passage outside. The huge arm and shoulder with a dark skin of greenish scales and the great flat toeless foot that appeared in the gap in the barred door of the chamber<ref name=\"Bridge\">{{FR|Bridge}}, p. 324</ref> presumably belonged to this cave-troll<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 293</ref>. After [[Frodo Baggins]] had stabbed the foot with [[Sting]], black blood dripped from the blade to the floor and smoked there.<ref name=\"Bridge\" /> Later during the flight of the fellowship through Moria, two trolls appeared in the [[Second Hall]] of Moria,<ref>{{FR|Bridge}}, pp. 328-9</ref> but it is not recorded if they were cave-trolls.\n\nMentioned only once in the written records of [[Arda]], nothing else is known of these creatures. One can only assume that this breed of [[troll]] lived in some of the caves of [[Middle-earth]]. The fact that Gandalf was able to recognise the creature he encountered in Moria specifically as a cave-troll strongly suggests that this appearance was shared by others of their kind.\n\n[[Category:Trolls]]\n[[Category:Servants of Sauron]]\n[[de:Höhletroll]]\n[[fi:Peikot]]"}}}
