She came from a musical background, and joined the band of some of her siblings and two of her uncles, [[wikipedia:Clannad|Clannad]], to play keyboards. After a few years, she left together with their manager Nicky Ryan, and continued her career as a solo artist. Since then, Ryan has been Enya's manager, producer, and arranger, while his wife, Roma Ryan, is her primary lyricist. Among other sources of inspiration, Enya shares [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s interest in the Catholic faith. Her music style became an iconic Celtic and Irish inspiration for several films and artists; the music of ''[[wikipedia:Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' was heavily inspired by her music.\n\nTen years prior to her involvement in [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|The Fellowship of the Ring movie soundtrack]], Enya wrote and performed a short instrumental track, ''[[Lothlórien (Enya song)|Lothlórien]]'', named for [[Lothlórien|the Elvish realm]] in [[Tolkien]]'s writings. It is the ninth track on her third solo studio album, ''Shepherd Moons'', which was released on [[4 November|November 4, 1991]].\n\nShe performed vocals on two tracks of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]'', which she also composed together with Roma Ryan, her lyricist. ''[[Aníron]]'' was the love-theme for [[Aragorn]] and [[Arwen]], and the Academy Award-nominated ''[[May It Be]]'' was included in the closing credits. Following her introduction to [[Quenya]] and [[Sindarin]], Roma Ryan created her own language, [[wikipedia:Loxian|Loxian]].\n\n==Discography, selected==\n* [[1991]]: ''[[wikipedia:Shepherd Moons|Shepherd Moons]]''\n** \"[[Lothlórien (Enya song)|Lothlórien]]\"\n* [[2001]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack]]''\n** \"[[Aníron]]\"\n** \"[[May It Be]]\"\n\n==Awards==\n* [[1993]] - '''[http://www.grammy.com/ Grammy Award]''', Best New Age Album, ''Shepherd Moons''\n* [[2002]] - '''[http://www.bfca.org/ Critics' Choice Award]''', Best Song, \"May It Be\"\n* 2002 - '''[http://www.lvfcs.org/ Sierra Award]''', Best Song, \"May It Be\"\n* 2002 - '''[http://www.cinemaclips.com/PFCS.htm PFCS Award]''', Best Original Song, \"May It Be\"\n\n== External links ==\n*'''[http://www.enya.com/ Official Website]'''\n* {{WP|Enya}}\n*[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0258216/ Enya] at [http://www.imdb.com/ IMDb]\n[[Category:Singers]]\n[[Category:Irish people]]\n[[Category:People by name]]\n[[Category:Folk music]]"}}}
