These oxen were hardier and wilder than any other in [[Middle-earth]].\n\nThe Kine were famous as the quarry of [[Vorondil]] the Hunter, ancestor of the [[Ruling Steward|Ruling Stewards of Gondor]]. It was he who cut a horn from one of these beasts and from it fashioned a hunting-horn; the [[Great Horn]], which came to be carried by the eldest son of the Ruling Steward from [[Vorondil]]'s time onward. The last heir to bear the Great Horn was [[Boromir]], who saw it broken in two in his battle with [[Orcs]] beneath [[Amon Hen]].<ref name=V1 /><ref>{{TT|IV5}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nLegends claimed that these oxen descended from the cattle of [[Oromë]], the Huntsman of the Valar, and so they were named the Kine of Araw<ref name=V1>{{RK|V1}}</ref><ref>{{App|South}}</ref>, [[Oromë#Etymology|Araw]] being the [[Sindarin]] form of Oromë's name.\n\n==Inspiration==\nIn an unpublished manuscript held at the [[Bodleian Library]], the Wild Kine were likened by [[J.R.R.
