Though the plant bloomed at all seasons, its flowers were not 'immortelles'.<ref name=\"N\">{{HM|N}}, p. 780</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Simbelmynë'' was the name of the flower in [[Rohan]], meaning \"[[Evermind]]\",<ref name=TTIII6/> a reference to the memories of the dead on whose tombs the flower grew. The name thus resembles 'forget-me-not', but a quite different kind of flower is intended. The [[Elves]] called them ''uilos'' and ''alfirin''.\n\nThe spelling does not appear to be completely fixed. Within ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', and in most other sources, its name is spelt ''simbelmynë''. However, there is at least one recorded instance where Tolkien prefers ''symbelmynë''.<ref>{{L|93}}</ref> These variations do not affect the meaning of its name.\n\nIt has been suggested that Tolkien derived ''simbelmynë'' from the [[Old English]] words ''simbel'' (\"ever\") and ''myne'' (\"mind\").<ref>John Tinkler, \"Old English in Rohan,\" in ''[[Tolkien and the Critics]]'', ed. N.D. Isaacs and R.A. Zimbardo (1968), p. 168</ref>\n\n==Inspiration==\nTolkien mentioned that Simbelmyne is an imagined variety of anemone. In appearance, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] compares Simbelmynë to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anemone_nemorosa European anemone], a small white flower growing among the grass or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsatilla_vulgaris Anemona pulsatilla], the \"pasque flower\".<ref name=\"N\"/>\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Flowers]]\n[[Category:Old English names]]\n[[de:Simbelmyne]]\n[[fr:encyclo:biologie:flore:symbelmyne]]\n[[fi:Simbelmynë]]"}}}
