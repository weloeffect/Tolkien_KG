The colour of the rock was a deep, gleaming black. At Orthanc's pinnacle the four piers opened out to form four pinnacles of sharp rock; between these isles of rock there was a narrow, polished floor on which many strange signs were written.<ref name=\"TTRoad\">{{TT|Road}}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|There stood a tower of marvellous shape. It was fashioned by the builders of old, who smoothed the Ring of Isengard, and yet it seemed a thing not made by the craft of Men, but riven from the bones of the earth in the ancient torment of the hills.|''[[The Two Towers]]'', \"[[The Road to Isengard]]\"}}\n\n==History==\n===Second Age===\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Orthanc in the Second Age.jpg|thumb|left|''Orthanc in the Second Age'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nThe exact date of the construction of Orthanc and the establishment of the fortress of [[Isengard]] is unknown beyond it being made by the Men of Númenor long ago.<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref>\n\nWithin Orthanc was placed one of the ''[[Palantíri]]'', the [[Orthanc-stone]]. Thus, Orthanc became one of the seven [[Dúnedain]] towers which stored the seeing stones that had been brought from [[Númenor]].<ref name=\"SV\">{{S|V}}</ref>\n\n===Third Age===\nThe region of [[Calenardhon]] was never densely populated; indeed it suffered greatly in the [[Great Plague]] of {{TA|1636}} and many inhabitants of Númenórean descent gradually migrated eastward. Eventually the tower of Orthanc itself became deserted, and [[Key of Orthanc|its keys]] were removed to [[Minas Tirith]] and held in the keeping of the [[Stewards of Gondor|Stewards]].<ref name=\"UTPalantiri\">{{UT|Palantiri}}</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|2510}},<ref name=\"UTIsen\">{{UT|Isen}}</ref> after the [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant]], the lands of [[Calenardhon]] were ceded to the [[Éothéod]] and [[Eorl]] became the first king of [[Rohan]]. Nonetheless Gondor retained control of the fortress of Isengard, and Orthanc remained the third tower of the southern realm. During this time Isengard was manned by a small number of Gondorians led by a hereditary Captain. However the keys of Orthanc were kept by the Stewards of Gondor.<ref name=\"UTCirion\">{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>\n\nOver time the links and correspondence between Isengard and [[Minas Tirith]] became ever more infrequent; whilst retaining the keys of Orthanc, the Stewards forsook the tower as their thoughts looked eastwards. Eventually the line of Gondorian chieftains failed and the people mingled ever more with the [[Dunlendings]]. They even allowed them entry into Isengard and eventually the two peoples willingly merged into one. Thus it was that Isengard came under the control of the Dunlendings who led numerous raids on the [[Westfold]]. Whilst the Rohirrim had not the strength to assail the fortress, the Dunlendings were eventually starved out in the great famine after the [[Long Winter]]. Therefore both [[Fréaláf|King Fréaláf]] and [[Beren (Steward of Gondor)|Steward Beren]] greatly welcomed [[Saruman|Saruman's]] offer to take command of Isengard. Thus it was that, in {{TA|2759}},<ref name=\"AppStewards\">{{App|Stewards}}</ref> the wizard was given the keys of Orthanc.<ref name=\"UTIsen\" />\n\nSaruman began to desire [[the One Ring]] for himself and hoped that it might reveal itself by giving [[Sauron]] time to re-gain his strength. As head of the [[White Council]], Saruman overruled Gandalf's call for an attack on [[Dol Guldur]] in {{TA|2851}}. However, in {{TA|2941}}, after Saruman discovered that the servants of Sauron were searching for the Ring near [[Gladden Fields]], he agreed to attack Sauron's fortress in [[Mirkwood]]. After the last meeting of the White Council in {{TA|2953}}, Saruman withdrew to [[Isengard]] and fortified it. It was in ''circa'' {{TA|3000}} that Saruman used the [[Orthanc-stone]] for the first time. Thus it was that Sauron corrupted Saruman's mind and bent it to his will.<ref name=\"AppB2\">{{App|B2}}</ref>\n\n[[File:John Howe - Gwaihir rescues Gandalf from Orthanc.jpg|thumb|right|''Gwaihir rescues Gandalf from Orthanc'' by [[John Howe]]]]\n{{Blockquote|Gandalf the Grey caught like a fly in a spider's treacherous web!|[[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', \"[[The Council of Elrond]]\"}}\n\nIn {{TA|3018}}, [[Gandalf]] rode to the foot of Orthanc and there met [[Saruman]]. It was then that Saruman revealed his true thoughts to Gandalf. He declared his desire to become a ruler of [[Men]] and to join with [[Sauron]]. But, most importantly, he announced his desire for the One Ring. Gandalf refused to submit to Sauron and Saruman. Subsequently, Saruman had Gandalf taken to the pinnacle of Orthanc where, Saruman schemed, Gandalf would stay until he revealed the location of the One Ring or until Sauron reclaimed it for himself. There Gandalf was trapped and for the first time he saw [[wolves]] and [[orcs]] in the valley of Isengard below. After many weeks of imprisonment,<ref group=\"note\">[[Gandalf]] was imprisoned on [[10 July]], {{TA|3018}} and escaped in the early hours of [[18 September]], {{TA|3018|n}}.</ref> Gandalf escaped as [[Gwaihir]] the Great [[Eagle]] came unlooked-for to Orthanc and bore him away.<ref name=\"FRCouncil\">{{FR|Council}}</ref>\n\nOn [[2 March]], {{TA|3019}}, the [[Ents]] of [[Fangorn Forest]] began their [[Battle of Isengard|attack on Isengard]].

Therein Saruman remained.<ref name=\"TTFlotsam\">{{TT|Flotsam}}</ref> On [[5 March]], [[Théoden]], [[Éomer]], [[Gandalf]], [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], and [[Gimli]] approached the foot of Orthanc and climbed its stair until they reached the door. There they parleyed with Saruman, who remained inside the tower and spoke to them from a balcony above the door. Saruman refused to co-operate and subsequently Gandalf cast him from the [[Istari|order of Wizards]] and the [[White Council]], and broke Saruman's staff. After this confrontation, [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]], who was also inside Orthanc, threw the [[Orthanc-stone|''palantír'' of Orthanc]] at the party outside as a parting shot.<ref name=\"TTVoice\">{{TT|Voice}}</ref>\n\nA week before [[22 August]], {{TA|3019}},<ref name=\"AppB3\"/> when [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] and company arrived at Orthanc, Saruman had departed Isengard with Gríma Wormtongue. However, before he left, [[Treebeard]] made him lock the tower and hand over the keys of Orthanc.<ref name=\"RKPartings\">{{RK|Partings}}</ref>\n\n===Fourth Age===\nOne of [[Aragorn|King Elessar's]] first tasks in the re-ordering of his realm was the restoration of Orthanc. He ordered that the ''[[palantír]]'' recovered from [[Saruman]] should be returned to the tower. It was then that the tower was searched and many secrets were revealed. It became clear that Saruman had hoarded many ancient treasures and heirlooms. They found that, with the aid of [[Gríma|Wormtongue]], Saruman had acquired jewels and heirlooms of [[Eorl]]. With the help of [[Gimli]] a hidden door was found and opened. Inside a casket found on a shelf they found two precious items. One was a small golden case attached to a chain; this was used by [[Isildur]] to bear [[the One Ring]]. The second item in the casket was the [[Elendilmir]], the \"white star of Elvish crystal upon a fillet of ''[[mithril]]''\" that had been lost since Isildur's demise. Elessar received the Elendilmir with reverence and took it with him as he established his full kingship of [[Arnor]]. It was clear that Saruman had found the remains of Isildur and that he had probably burned the body.<ref name=\"UTIsen\" />\n\nOrthanc and the lands of Isengard remained part of the [[Reunited Kingdom|Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor]]. However King Elessar granted the [[Ents]] complete self-governance of the area surrounding Orthanc. This new forest became known as the [[Treegarth of Orthanc]].<ref name=\"RKPartings\" />\n\n==Etymology==\n''Orthanc'' displays a curious double etymology (co-existing \"by design or chance\") since it has a meaning both in the \"[[Rohanese|language of the Mark of old]]\" (rendered as [[Old English]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'') and [[J.R.R.
