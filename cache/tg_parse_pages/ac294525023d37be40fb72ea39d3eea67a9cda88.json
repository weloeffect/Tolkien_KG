Tolkien]].\n\n==Foreword to the Second Edition (October, 1966)==\n{{blockquote|The prime motive was the desire of a tale-teller to try his hand at a really long story that would hold the attention of readers, amuse them, delight them, and at times maybe excite them or deeply move them.}}\n\n{{blockquote|Some who have read the book, or at any rate have reviewed it, have found it boring, absurd, or contemptible; and I have no cause to complain, since I have similar opinions of their works, or of the kinds of writing that they evidently prefer.}}\n\n{{blockquote|The most critical reader of all, myself, now finds many defects, minor and major, but being fortunately under no obligation either to review the book or to write it again, he will pass over these in silence, except one that has been noted by others: the book is too short.}}\n\n{{blockquote|I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and always have done so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its presence. I much prefer history, true or feigned, with its varied applicability to the thought and experience of readers. I think that many confuse 'applicability' with 'allegory'; but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in the purposed domination of the author.}}\n\n==Quotations for each book==\n*Books I and II - [[The Fellowship of the Ring/Quotations|''The Fellowship of the Ring''/Quotations]]\n*Books III and IV - [[The Two Towers/Quotations|''The Two Towers''/Quotations]]\n*Books V and VI - [[The Return of the King/Quotations|''The Return of the King''/Quotations]]\n*Appendices - [[The Lord of the Rings Appendices/Quotations|''The Lord of the Rings'' Appendices/Quotations]]\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:''The Lord of the Rings''/Quotations}}\n[[Category:Quotes]]"}}}
