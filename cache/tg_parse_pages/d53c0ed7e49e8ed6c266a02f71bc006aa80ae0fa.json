Apparently this has propagated the belief that dwarves are exclusively male and spontaneously pop out of the earth, which makes Éowyn laugh and which Gimli dismisses as nonsense. When he accidentally causes his horse to gallop forwards, throwing him off the animal's back, Éowyn rushes to his aid with a smile on her face. Observing the scene, [[Théoden]] comments to [[Aragorn]] that it's been a long time since he has seen his niece smile. He tells Aragorn that Éowyn was only a girl when her father was killed by [[Orcs]] and she was handed over to [[Théoden]]'s keeping. He also laments that he wasn't the most affectionate guardian to her at the time and regrets not showing her more love.\n\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers scenes|31]]"}}}
