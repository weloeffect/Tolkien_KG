Their mission at first seemed successful, and [[Balin]] went so far as to claim the title [[Lord of Moria]]. This all changed in their fifth year there. On November 10, the [[Orcs]] came up the [[Silverlode]] and killed Balin while he was alone, and unaware and looking into [[Mirrormere]]. The Dwarves fought back but  eventually lost [[East-gate]] and [[First Hall]]. \nThe Orcs made it across the [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm]] and there was a [[Battle of the Second Hall|battle in the Second Hall]], and Frár and his companions [[Lóni]] and [[Náli]] died bravely while the rest of the colonists retreated.<ref>{{FR|Bridge}}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Frár'' is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. His name most likely means \"swift\".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, \"Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion\", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Frar}}\n[[Category:Dwarves]]\n[[Category:Longbeards]]\n[[Category:Norse names]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n[[de:Frár]]\n[[fi:Frár]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/nains/3a/frar]]"}}}
