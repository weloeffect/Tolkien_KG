Tra-la-la-lally!\n     Come back to the valley!\n\nThe stars are far brighter\nThan gems without measure,\nThe moon is far whiter\nThan silver in treasure:\nThe fire is more shining\nOn hearth in the gloaming\nThan gold won by mining,\nSo why go a-roaming?\n     O!  Tra-la-la-lally \n     Come back to the Valley.\n\nO! Where are you going,\nSo late in returning?\nThe river is flowing,\nThe stars are all burning!\nO! Whither so laden,\nSo sad and so dreary?\nHere elf and elf-maiden\nNow welcome the weary\n     With Tra-la-la-lally\n     Come back to the Valley,\n          Tra-la-la-lally\n          Fa-la-la-lally\n               Fa-la!\n</poem>\n\n\n==See also==\n* [[Poems in The Hobbit|Poems in ''The Hobbit'']]\n{{DEFAULTSORT:dragon is withered, The}}\n[[Category:Poems in The Hobbit]]\n[[fi:Lohikäärme tuhottiin]]"}}}
