It was considered one of the most beautiful and \"elvish\" places in [[Middle-earth]] during the [[Third Age]], and had the only [[mallorn]]-trees east of the [[Belegaer|sea]].\n\n==History==\n===First settlers===\nThe first inhabitants of the forested area later known as Lórien were a group of [[Nandor]] that refused to cross the [[Hithaeglir]].<ref>{{UT|6a}}</ref> These Nandor scattered across the forests of Wilderland on both sides of the [[Anduin]].<ref name=POME>{{PM|XNotes}}, Note 67, p. 329</ref> The folk of Lórien were neighbours and kin to that of [[Eryn Galen]] on the east bank of the Anduin.<ref name=\"Sindarin\">{{UT|6b}}</ref> They named the forest that lay between the mountains and the Great River, above the [[Limlight]] and below the [[Gladden River|Gladden]],<ref name=geo>{{NM|P3xvii}}</ref> as ''Lindórinand'' in their [[Silvan Elvish|Silvan tongue]].<ref name=names>{{UT|Concerning}}, Note 5</ref>\n\n===Sindarin dynasty===\nFollowing the destruction of [[Beleriand]] and the [[War of Wrath]] at the end of the [[First Age]], most of the [[Noldor]]in exiles and remnants of the Sindar retreated to [[Lindon]] and many refused the invitation of The [[Valar]]. One of the unwilling was [[Amdír]].<ref name=Sindarin /> He, along with his son [[Amroth]], established himself in [[Lórinand]], where he would soon lead the princeless [[Silvan Elves]].<ref name=\"AaN\">{{UT|Amroth}}</ref> The arrival of the Sinda [[Amdír]] affected the Nandor of Laurelindórenan. He took over as their King, while another Sinda, [[Oropher]], became King of [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]]. Their language was replaced by [[Sindarin]].<ref name=Sindarin />\n\n[[Celeborn]], a Sindarin elf, dwelt with his [[Noldor]]in wife [[Galadriel]] in [[Eregion]]. They made contact with the [[Galadhrim]] and before long they passed through [[Moria]] and arrived in the woods. Before the [[Sack of Eregion|Fall of Eregion]] and the death of [[Celebrimbor]], [[Nenya]], one of the [[Three Rings]] of the Elves, was delivered to Galadriel.<ref name=Concerning>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref> Other survivors of [[Eregion]], including many [[Noldor]] and [[Sindar]], escaped into [[Khazad-dûm]] and were granted passage by their friends the [[Dwarves]], coming eventually through the [[Misty Mountains]] to the woodland.<ref name=\"Galadriel\">{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref>\n\nAs [[Sauron]]'s power grew over the [[Westlands]], King Amdír marshalled the Galadhrim to the [[War of the Last Alliance]] where many fell in the [[Dead Marshes]] along with their King.<ref name=Sindarin/>\n\nThe survivors, which included Amdír's son [[Amroth]], returned to Lórinand. Amroth was the new King, but he was tired of Middle-earth, and wished to go West and seek [[Valinor]]. When Moria fell to evil in {{TA|1981}}, many of the Galadhrim fled [[Edhellond|south]]. Amroth also departed with his beloved, [[Nimrodel (Elf-maid)|Nimrodel]], and they were never seen again.<ref name=\"AaN\"/>\n\n===Lord and Lady===\n[[Image:Angus McBride - Galadriel.gif|thumb|left|''Galadriel'' by [[Angus McBride]]]]\nAfter Amroth and Nimrodel had passed away, Celeborn and Galadriel took the title of [[Lord and Lady of Galadhrim]].<ref name=Concerning/> With Nenya, the land was kept pure and alive, and evil was not permitted to penetrate it. They moved back to the western side of Anduin and built [[Caras Galadhon]], the great centre of the woodland kingdom. There Galadriel planted the seeds of the [[mallorn]] trees that were given to her by Gil-galad when she lived in [[Lindon]], where they couldn't grow.<ref>{{UT|Numenor}}</ref> Because of the golden leaves of the mellyrn and the rule of the Lord and Lady, Lindórinand was given many new names, most famously ''Lothlórien''.<ref name=names /> Lothlórien was filled with light and life and became beautiful, and by the power of the Elven Ring the trees did not die.\n\nUnder the Lord and Lady, Lothlórien prospered for more than a thousand years as time passed without decay under the golden boughs. Celeborn and Galadriel produced a daughter, [[Celebrían]], who married [[Elrond]], and their granddaughter [[Arwen|Arwen Undómiel]] was considered the fairest of the elven race at that time.\n\nIn {{TA|3017}}, [[Aragorn]] passed by Lothlórien with the captured [[Gollum]] to deliver him to [[Mirkwood]]. [[Gandalf]] got word from Lothlórien on his way to the [[Shire]], and he changed his course to go and meet them.<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref>\n\n===War of the Ring===\n[[File:Anna Kulisz - The Fellowship in Lothlorien.jpg|thumb|''The Fellowship in Lothlorien'' by [[:Category:Images by Anna Kulisz|Anna Kulisz]]]]\nBut as the [[Third Age]] came to an end, troubles at last began to touch the Valley of Singing Gold. As the shadow of [[Sauron]] lengthened and the [[War of the Ring]] raged, the border-wardens came across the remnant of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], a group of travellers on a [[Quest of the Ring|quest]] of immeasurable importance. Among the company were [[Aragorn]], a prince of the [[Dúnedain]] and a friend of the Lady, as well as [[Legolas]] of [[Mirkwood]]. The only reservation the border-wardens had about them was the dwarf, [[Gimli]].<ref name=loth>{{FR|II6}}</ref> The Fellowship were led blindfolded for a time, but at Galadriel's word their blindfolds were released and they were taken to Caras Galadhon on [[17 January]] {{TA|3019}}.<ref name=Great>{{App|Great}}</ref> The very night the Fellowship arrived, a band of [[Orcs]] crossed the [[Nimrodel (river)|Nimrodel]]. A regiment or so of the [[Galadhrim]] were sent out, and destroyed the Orcs.<ref name=loth/>\n\nThere the Elves learned of the death of [[Gandalf]], and Galadriel knew what [[The One Ring|evil]] had been brought into the Golden Wood. She revealed her own ring to Frodo, and showed him her [[Mirror of Galadriel|mirror]].<ref>{{FR|II7}}</ref> Then the Fellowship was furnished with new supplies and sent off down Anduin, bearing the [[Gifts of Galadriel|gifts]] of the Lord and Lady.<ref>{{FR|II8}}</ref>\n\nRight when the Company left, [[Gwaihir]] brought [[Gandalf]] to the Golden Wood, who was recovering from his battle with [[Durin's Bane]]. He was healed, clothed and given a new staff before leaving for [[Fangorn]].<ref>{{TT|White}}</ref>\n\nBut the coming of the [[One Ring]] was only the beginning of their troubles that were the heralds of greater conflicts that were to occur. [[Sauron]] unleashed [[assaults on Lothlórien|massive attacks]] on the Golden Wood.\n\nOn [[11 March]], forces from [[Dol Guldur]] swarmed into the forest in a full-scale assault. By the power of the Wood-elves and Galadriel’s ring, they were repulsed. The second wave came on [[15 March]], at the same time as the [[Battle under the trees|invasion of Mirkwood]]. Again, the enemies were forced out. The third and last attack was made seven days later, on [[22 March]]. They caused much destruction on the wood's borders, but the valiant Galadhrim routed them utterly. And after the [[Shadow]] of Sauron was lifted, they stormed [[Dol Guldur]] and cleansed [[Mirkwood]]; [[Thranduil]] gave its southern part into the dominion of Lothlórien, and it was called [[East Lórien]].<ref name=Great/>\n\nOn their way to [[Gondor]], [[Elrond]] and [[Arwen]] came to Lothlórien on [[20 May]].<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref>\n\n===Afterward===\n[[File:War in Middle Earth - Lothlórien.png|thumb|right|Lothlórien in ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien's War in Middle Earth]]'']]\nOnly two-and-a-half years after the War of the Ring, Galadriel, the Lady of Lórien, took ship West to Valinor.\n\nThe eastern border of Lothlórien in the southern [[Eryn Lasgalen]] became [[East Lórien]]. It was founded after the cleansing of [[Dol Guldur]] during the [[War of the Ring]], and [[Celeborn]] ruled the [[Galadhrim]] of Lothlórien. In the [[Fourth Age]], he grew weary and left for [[Rivendell]], leaving the wooded land of East Lórien populated by only a few wandering [[Silvan Elves]].<ref name=\"Great\"/>\n\nIn {{FoA|121}}, a grief-filled [[Arwen Undómiel]] travelled to Lothlórien, now fully abandoned, after [[Aragorn]] surrendered his life, surrendering her own life upon [[Cerin Amroth]]. \"[T]here is her green grave, until the world is changed, and all the days of her life are utterly forgotten...\"<ref>{{App|Tale}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nLothlórien stood between the south-eastern end of the Misty Mountains and the great river Anduin. The river Celebrant ran through the wood from its source in the mountains to the west through to the Anduin to the east.\n\nIn its earlier days, the woods of Lothlórien extended south into Fangorn Forest. In these days there was no true border between the two territories, though after conversation between [[Treebeard]] and the King of the Golden Wood it was agreed that the inhabitants of either land could walk freely at their leisure across whatever borders there may be.<ref name=\"Galadriel\"/> It is also possible that the woods of Lórien extended into the southern regions of Greenwood the Great, though there is only a small amount of evidence supporting this possibility.<ref name=\"Galadriel\"/> By the Third Age, Lórien was separate from Fangorn in the south and Mirkwood in the east by many miles.\n\n==Locations==\n*[[Caras Galadhon]]\n*[[Cerin Amroth]]\n\n==Etymology==\n''Lothlórien'', said to mean \"Lórien of the Blossom\", is a compound of [[Sindarin]] ''[[loth]]'' + [[Quenya]] ''[[Lórien (Valinor)|Lórien]]'' (\"?Dream Land\"). Treebeard translates the name as \"Dreamflower\".<ref name=HMRC>{{HM|UI}}, p. 300</ref>\n\n==Other names==\nLothlórien was often shortened to '''Lórien''', or the '''Golden Wood''' (referring to the golden [[mallorn]] trees that grew in that land).<ref name=HMRC/><ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, p. 48</ref> Other names recorded for the region were:\n\n* ''Lindórinand'', ?[[Nandorin|N.]] \"Vale of the Land of the Singers\"<ref name=names />\n* ''[[Lórinand]]'', ?N. \"Valley of gold\"<ref name=names />\n* ''Laurenandë'', [[Quenya|Q.]] \"Valley of gold\"<ref name=names />\n* ''Glornan'', [[Sindarin|S.]] \"Valley of gold\"<ref name=names />\n* ''Nan Laur'', S. \"Valley of gold\"<ref name=names />\n* ''Laurelindórenan'', ''Laurelindórinan''<ref name=names>{{UT|Concerning}}, Note 5</ref> Q. \"Valley of Singing Gold\"\n* ''Dwimordene'', [[Old English]] \"Haunted valley\"<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry \"Dwimordene\"</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nIn the drafts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' Tolkien was unsure whether time of the outside world \"froze\" while the Fellowship stayed in Lórien, changing his mind twice; according to the first scheme the Fellowship had left Lórien and passed [[Sarn Gebir]] already on [[21 January]]. Eventually he decided that time passes normally, and had to adjust the dates and the routes of the characters, later changing their departure to [[14 February]] and eventually [[16 February]] (taking into account the full moon of [[7 March]]).<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. xlvi, xlvii</ref> In the published book, the characters instead have lost their subjective sense of time after leaving Lórien.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''1988: ''[[J.R.R.
