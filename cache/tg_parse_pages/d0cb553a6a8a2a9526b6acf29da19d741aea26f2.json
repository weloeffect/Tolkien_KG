Later, when the Polar Bear was snowballing him in the garden, he accidentally pushed him over the edge of the cliff and into Father Christmas's sleigh. This broke many things, including himself, and Father Christmas used what was left of him to draw a white picture.<ref>{{LFC|1927}}</ref> Presumably he was rebuilt after this accident, as he is mentioned in Father Christmas's second [[1930]] letter as the \"oldest of all the snowmen\", sometimes drawing a Snowman as his signature instead of writing his name, and quarrelling with the Polar Bear, who pushed him through the roof of his snow house.<ref>{{LFC|1930b}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n{{WLFC}}\n[[Category:Characters in Letters from Father Christmas]]\n[[Category:Mythology]]"}}}
