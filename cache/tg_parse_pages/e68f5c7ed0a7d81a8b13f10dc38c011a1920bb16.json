Tolkien Companion and Guide''''' is a most comprehensive reference book on the life and works of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. This work is by [[Christina Scull]] and [[Wayne G. Hammond]], first published in [[2006]].\n\nThe first edition consists of two volumes, one is an extraodinarily detailed '''''Chronology''''' of Tolkien's life, the other is a '''''Reader's Guide''''' containing entries on all things, places, and persons that Tolkien was concerned with, arranged in alphabetical order. The whole work totals up to 2300 pages.\n\nA second edition was published in [[2017]], with much revision and addition to the first edition that the ''Reader's Guide'' has to be divided into two volumes. The book is now expanded to have 2720 pages.\n\n==Overview==\n;1. Chronology\nThe ''Chronology'', being the first of the three volumes, traces J.R.R. Tolkien's progress from his birth in South Africa in 1892, to the battlefields of France and the lecture-halls of Leeds and Oxford, to his success as the author of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, until his death in 1973.\n\nIt is the most extensive biographical resource about Tolkien ever published. Thousands of details have been drawn from letters, contemporary documents in libraries and archives, and a wide variety of other published and unpublished sources. Assembled together, they form a revealing portrait of Tolkien in all his aspects: the distinguished scholar of Old and Middle English, the capable teacher and administrator, the devoted husband and father, the brilliant creator of Middle-earth.\n\n;2. Reader's Guide\nThe ''Reader's Guide'', being the two remaining volumes, is an indispensable introduction to J.R.R. Tolkien's life, writings and art. It includes histories and discussions of his works; analyses of the components of his vast Silmarillion mythology; brief biographies of people important in his life; accounts of places he knew; essays on topics such as Tolkien's interests and attitudes towards contemporary issues, ideas found in his works, adaptations and invented languages; and checklists of his published works, his poetry, his pictorial art, and translations of his writings.\n\n==Reception==\nDavid Oberhelman, writing in ''[[Mythlore]]'', calls the work \"undoubtedly a seminal if not the definitive reference work on the Professor\". He states that \"in true Tolkien fashion, [it] grew in the telling\". In his opinion, \"the breadth of the coverage and the authority with which Scull and Hammond document Tolkien's life and times will make these books an invaluable supplement to [[Humphrey Carpenter]]'s classic [[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography|1977 biography]] and their own 2005 ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]''\". Oberhelman notes that rather than studying the fictional [[Middle-earth]], the work focuses on Tolkien himself, describing \"people, places and things\" linked to Tolkien. Where there is interpretation beyond what Tolkien or his [[Christopher Tolkien|son Christopher]] write, the work tends to cite scholars like [[Verlyn Flieger]] and [[Tom Shippey]]. Arguments are presented in a balanced way, and the discussions are \"always informative as well as entertaining\". Oberhelman calls the work \"truly a monumental achievement\".<ref>Oberhelman, David D. (2007). \"Review of The J. R. R. Tolkien Companion and Guide\". Mythlore. 25</ref>\n\n[[John Garth]], in ''[[Tolkien Studies]]'', describes Scull and Hammond's work as a \"super-heavyweight contribution by two highly regarded veterans of Tolkien studies.\" In his view, while [[Michael D.C. Drout]]'s ''[[The J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia]]'' may have the edge on matters of criticism, Scull and Hammond is best on \"biographical matters\". The work's encyclopedic structure \"rightly\" avoids having entries on fictional people, places, and \"totems\", an approach that works like Robert Foster's ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'' had incautiously adopted. Instead, it \"ambitiously\" aims to cover the whole of Tolkien's life in diaristic detail, as ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'' did for 1944, given that Tolkien had written repeatedly to his son Christopher in that year detailing small events in his life. The result is to offer the scholar and the interested reader a wealth of detail on why and how Tolkien wrote as he did.<ref>Garth, John (2007). \"The J. R. R.
