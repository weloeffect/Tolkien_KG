The ''Ranga'' was said to be a full stride from the rear heel to the front toe, by a full-grown Númenórean man in quick march. It was slightly longer than a yard, measuring 38 inches (3'2\", or 96.5 centimetres). 5000 ''Rangar'' made up a ''[[Lár]]''. \n\nIn the later days, when the stature of the [[Númenóreans]] decreased, two ''Rangar'' was called \"man-high\" (suggesting that the average adult male [[Dúnedain|Dúnadan]] was 6'4\" or thereabouts). One ''Ranga'' was also the average height of a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] (hence the name [[halflings|''half''ling]] by the Dúnedain).<ref>{{UT|Linear}}</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Quenya nouns]]\n[[Category:Measures]]"}}}
