In the library, Peregrin Took and his successors collected many manuscripts written by scribes of [[Gondor]], including the [[King's Writer]] [[Findegil]]'s important copy of the [[Thain's Book]]. Here could be found histories and legends related to [[Elendil]] and his heirs, and only here were extensive materials about the history of [[Númenor]] and the arising of [[Sauron]]. ''[[The Tale of Years]]'' was probably assembled here.<ref>{{FR|Records}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Great Smials are located at the center of Tuckborough, with the current Thain residing inside the main hall and many other Tooks living in adjacent Hobbit holes. Players can visit Great Smials at two different points in Timeline: in October of {{TA|3018}} during the peaceful time and later during Summer of {{TA|3019}}, when the Shire is overrun by [[Saruman|Sharkey]]'s brigands. During the later encounter, the Tooks have barricaded themselves inside Smials, which are besieged by Brigands; the player(s) is given the task of thinning their ranks and slaying their leader, preventing the Ruffians from burning the Tooks out.\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Buildings]]\n[[Category:Cities, towns and villages of the Shire]]\n\n[[de:Groß-Smials]]\n[[fi:Suuret Smialit]]"}}}
