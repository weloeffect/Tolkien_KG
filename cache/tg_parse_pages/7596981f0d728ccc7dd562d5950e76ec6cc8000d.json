Morello]]]]\n'''Gar Ainion''', the '''Place of the Gods''', was a sort of temple in [[Gondolin]], according to the early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. \n\nIt was located nigh the king's halls, going southwards by the [[Road of Pomps]]. It was very open and at its middle was the highest ground of all the city, from which the [[Square of the Palace]] could be seen. It was here that [[Idril]] and [[Tuor]] were wed, in the Place of Wedding. During the [[Fall of Gondolin]], [[Voronwë]] took a confused Idril to Gar Ainion, where they were found by [[Tuor]] and his group of survivors. From there, they gazed with despair the Square of the King being overran by enemies, the fall of the [[Tower of the King|king's tower]] and the death of King [[Turgon]].<ref>{{LT2|III}}, pp. 164, 186-8</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Gar Ainion'' is [[Gnomish]], from ''gardh'' (\"place, district\")<ref>{{PE|15}}, p. 24</ref> + genitive plural ''[[Ainur|Ainu]]''.
