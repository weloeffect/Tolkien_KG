The inscription in Book IX reads:\n\n:\"''In this book is traced first the story of the destruction of the One Ring and the Downfall of Sauron at the End of the Third Age.

Beginning with Sam’s rescue of Frodo from the Tower of Cirith Ungol, and giving a very different account of the [[Scouring of the Shire]], this section ends with versions of the hitherto unpublished Epilogue, in which, years after the departure of Bilbo and Frodo from the [[Grey Havens]], Sam attempts to answer his children’s questions.<br>\nThe second section is an edition of The Notion Club Papers. These mysterious papers, discovered in the early years of the twenty-first century, report the discussions of an Oxford club in the years 1986-7, in which after a number of topics, the centre of interest turns to the legend of Atlantis, the strange communications received by other members of the club from the past, and the violent irruption of the legend into the North-west of Europe.}}\n\n==Publication history and gallery==\n;UK editions\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"125px\" heights=\"125px\">\nFile:Sauron Defeated 1992.png|1992 hardcover\nFile:Sauron Defeated (HC1993).jpg|1993 paperback\nFile:Sauron Defeated (HC1993b).png|1993 paperback 2nd impression\nFile:Sauron Defeated (HC2002).jpeg|2002 & 2015 paperback\nFile:Sauron Defeated (HC2010).jpg|2010 hardcover\nFile:Sauron Defeated 2024.jpeg|2024 paperback\nFile:Sauron Defeated hc 2024.jpg|2024 hardcover\n</gallery>\n* [[HarperCollins]] hardcover ([[1992]]), pp.&nbsp;482.
