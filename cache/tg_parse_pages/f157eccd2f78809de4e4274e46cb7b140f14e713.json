His name is remembered in the poem [[Song of the Mounds of Mundburg]].<ref>{{RK|Battle}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n''Herefara'' is [[Old English]] for \"war-traveller\".\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n'''2013: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:Herefara comes from the town of Woodhurst in the Stonedeans, a province in the western [[Rohan]] where many men have a mix of Rohirrim and Dunlending ancestry. His grandparents are Briant and Reeve Heremond; and his parents are Cynethryth and [[Herubrand]]. Under the influence of [[Saruman]], in early March {{TA|3019}} a conspiracy of men attacks the Reeve's family in the Mead Hall of Woodhurst. Heremond and Cynethryth are slain but Herubrand, who is wounded, is saved by his loyalist who hide him and his mother outside the city. They enlist the player, an outsider who could not have been involved the attack, to help them in uncovering the conspiracy and eventually take back the control of his city. Herefara is not present during these events, as he is leading the defence of Brockbridge, a village ruled by [[Háma]]'s father Léoferth to the south from the forces of [[Isengard]]. \n:Herubrand and Herefara are later met in the [[Druadan Forest]] during the march of Rohirrim towards [[Minas Tirith]]. Herefara joins the player in patrolling the lands around beacons [[Nardol]] and [[Eilenach]]. During the [[Battle of Pelennor Fields]] the father and son fight side by side, but are slain by [[Gothmog]]'s orcs.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:Rohirrim]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n\n[[de:Herefara]]\n[[fi:Herefara]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/hommes/3a/hommes du nord/rohirrim/herefara]]"}}}
