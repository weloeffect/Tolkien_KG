It is notable for its companion volume, ''[[A Middle English Vocabulary]]'' by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].\n\n==History==\n===First edition 1921===\n''A Middle English Vocabulary'' was not published until 1922, but after publication some copies were bound with 1st impressions of Sisam’s book. They were intended to be published together, but Tolkien’s contribution was delayed. ''Fourteenth Century Verse & Prose'' was also issued separately without Tolkien's glossary.\n\nThere is a possibility of a 1933 impression of this book with a grey coloured dustwrapper rather than the later tan coloured one.\n\nThe book was reprinted in [[1923]], [[1924]], [[1927]], and [[1933]]. Copies dated [[1925]] and [[1928]] have also been reported.\n\nThe copies in a dark red binding include Tolkien’s glossary, whereas copies in a blue coloured binding do not.\n\nThe corrigenda printed on the last page of 1922 copies of ''A Middle English Vocabulary'' were incorporated into the text of the 1923 impression of ''Fourteenth Century Verse & Prose''.\n\n===First edition, 6th impression, 1937===\nThe 6th impression corrected previously issued impressions.\n\n''Fourteenth Century Verse & Prose'' was also issued separately without Tolkien's glossary.\n\nReprinted in [[1944]], [[1946]], [[1948]] and [[1950]].\n\nCopies in a dark red binding include Tolkien’s glossary, whereas copies in a blue coloured binding do not.  The only exception to this is the 10th impression of 1950, where both were issued in the blue binding. Copies without the glossary were issued in a grey coloured dustwrapper of similar design.\n\n==References==\n<small>\n*[[Douglas A. Anderson]], [[Wayne G. Hammond]] (eds.), ''[[J.R.R.
