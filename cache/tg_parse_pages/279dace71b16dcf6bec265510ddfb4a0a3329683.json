He was representative of the greedy and ill-mannered traits of his family.\n==History==\nOtho was the only known child of [[Longo Baggins]] and [[Camellia Sackville]].<ref name=\"Baggins\">{{App|Baggins}}</ref> Through his mother, he was the head of the [[Sackville Family]], so he adopted the double surname out of custom.<ref name = \"Letter214\">{{LE|214}}</ref> Otho had [[pipe-weed]] plantations in the [[Southfarthing]].<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref> He married [[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins|Lobelia Bracegirdle]] with whom he had a son named [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins|Lotho]].\n\nHe was also second in line to patriarchy of the [[Baggins Family]], and would have been [[Bilbo Baggins]]' heir were it not for his adoption of his cousin [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]. Despite laws dictating that adoption of a member of a different family would not affect headship, Bilbo was of the opinion that Frodo was still deserving of the heirship, as he was a close relative of the same name. Otho objected, though it was ultimately decided that Frodo would become the family's official heir.<ref name = \"Letter214\"></ref> This did not sit well with Otho and his wife, as they both dearly wanted to live in [[Bag End]].<ref name=\"Party\">{{FR|Party}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Otho was a guest at [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]]. After Bilbo had vanished in front of the crowd during the celebration, Otho and his wife departed in wrath. The [[23 September|next day]] he and Lobelia visited Bag End and demanded from [[Merry Brandybuck]] to see Frodo and insisted on seeing Bilbo's will, which, unfortunately for him, was valid and clear that Frodo was his legal heir.<ref name=\"Party\"/> \n\nHe did not live long enough to see Bag End as he died in {{SR|1412}}; it was six years later when Lobelia eventually did come into possession of Bag End, and moved in with her son.<ref>{{FR|Three}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Otho'' was meaningless in contemporary [[Hobbitish]] [[Westron]]. It represented an original name ''Otha''.<ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Hobbit - An Unexpected Journey - Otho Sackville-Baggins.jpg|left|thumb|100px|Otho in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]]]\n'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''\n:Although he is not named as such until the programme credits, [[John Livesey]] plays Otho at Bilbo's 111th Birthday party.  He and Lobelia are given a brief exchange complaining about being part of one gross, and questioning what Frodo coming into his inheritance means. \n\n'''2001: {{fotree}}:'''\n:[[Peter Corrigan]] plays Otho, though he does not have any lines.\n\n'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:'''\n:Otho, played by Brian Hotter, appears briefly in both the [[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (extended edition)|Extended Edition]] of ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'' where he and [[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins|Lobelia]] are seen in the [[Hobbiton]] marketplace, as well as ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'' where he and Lobelia again appear at the end when [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]'s possessions are being auctioned off. He once again does not have any lines in these films.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Characters in The Lord of the Rings]]\n[[Category:Hobbits]]\n[[Category:Sackville-Baggins]]\n[[Category:Third Age characters]]\n\n[[de:Otho Sackheim-Beutlin]]\n[[fi:Otho Säkinheimo-Reppuli]]\n[[fr:encyclo/personnages/hobbits/sacquet de besace/otho sacquet de besace]]"}}}
