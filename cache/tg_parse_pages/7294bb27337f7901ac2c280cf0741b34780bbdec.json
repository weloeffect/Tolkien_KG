Lobelia was renowned in the [[The Shire]] for her temper and greed. She later married [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s cousin [[Otho Sackville-Baggins]], and they had one child together, [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins|Lotho]], who was born in {{SR|1364}}.<ref name=\"Bag\">{{App|Baggins}}</ref>\n\nHer envy of [[Bag End]] was well-known; when Bilbo left for [[Quest for Erebor|his legendary journey]] in {{SR|1341}}<ref name=\"Return\">{{H|Return}}</ref> she coveted Bag End and found an oportunity to steal some of Bilbo's spoons, as Bilbo suspected after his return, and Lobelia knew well his suspicions. Lobelia and Otho were furious when Bilbo made [[Frodo Baggins]] his heir, him being a more distant relative. However, he did invite them to [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|his farewell feast]], with magnificent invitations written with golden ink; Lobelia could not ignore it. The [[23 September|next day]] she and Otho came to Bag End, hearing that Bilbo's household was being given out, but Frodo said that what was directed to her was only a case of silver spoons. She took \"the point\", and took the gift. But later as Otho left, she was still there, investigating nooks and corners and tapping the floors, she had snatched some small valuable things in her umbrella, until Frodo relieved her and drove her out, as she shouted that he should also leave, being half [[Brandybuck Family|Brandybuck]], did not belong here. [[Gandalf]] later saw her driving a pony-trap towards [[Bywater]].<ref>{{FR|Party}}</ref>\n\nHer angry words to Frodo turned out to be true: he decided to leave for [[Crickhollow]] (a ruse to escape the Shire) he sold Bag End to Lobelia by [[June]] {{TA|3018}}, but unfortunately Lobelia was now centennial, and Otho had died by then. The titles would pass to her on [[24 September]], but she went there [[23 September|the previous day]] with Lotho, and an inventory list to inspect that nothing she had paid for had been carried off to Buckland. She went right though her list, and in the end they departed with the spare key; Frodo said that his own would be left with the [[Gamgee Family]] and Lobelia reacted as if she thought that the Gamgees would rob the household the next day.<ref name=\"Company\">{{FR|I3}}</ref> \n[[File:Miriam Ellis - Lobelia rescued from the Lockholes.png|thumb|200px|left|\"Lobelia rescued from [[Lockholes|the Lockholes]]\" by [[Miriam Ellis]]]]\nDuring the [[War of the Ring]], Lobelia was imprisoned in [[Lockholes]] for arguing with the [[Chief Shirriff|Chief]]'s Men, and attacking one of them with an umbrella.<ref name=\"Scouring\">{{RK|Scouring}}</ref> After finding [[Fredegar Bolger]], Frodo finds Lobelia, old and frail. As Frodo lets her out, Lobelia was popular for the first time for bravely standing up to the [[Saruman]]'s [[Ruffians|Men]], receiving cheers and applauds. However, she was crushed to find out her son had been murdered whilst she was in prison. After the War of the Ring, Lobelia returned to her home village to live with the other [[Bracegirdle Family|Bracegirdle]]s, giving Bag End to Frodo. When she died in the Spring of {{TA|3020}}, she gave her money to Frodo to be used to help [[hobbits]] left homeless by Saruman and her son, which deeply moved Frodo.<ref name=\"Grey\">{{RK|Havens}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n[[Wikipedia:Lobelia|Lobelia]] is a genus of the bellflower family, named after [[Wikipedia:Matthias de L'Obel|Matthias de L'Obel]].<ref>{{HM|IE}}, \"Giving of Names\" p. 195</ref> Some species are commonly grown as garden flowers.\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n===Lobelia in adaptations===\n<gallery mode=\"traditional\" widths=\"200px\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring (video game) - Lobelia Sackville-Baggins.JPG|Lobelia in [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]\nFile:Cortney Skinner - Lobelia Sackville-Baggins (MECCG).jpg|Lobelia in ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring - Lobelia Sackville-Baggins.jpg|Lobelia in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''\nFile:The Lord of the Rings Online - Lobelia Sackville-Baggins.jpg|Lobelia in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''\nFile:The Hobbit - An Unexpected Journey - Lobelia Sackville-Baggins.jpg|Lobelia in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]\n</gallery>\n\n'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:''' \n:Although she is only named in passing, Diana Bishop plays Lobelia at Bilbo's 111th Birthday party.
