Abigail was invented for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'' by [[Amazon Studios]], where she was portrayed by [[Virginie Laverdure]].<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10582302/fullcredits|articlename=Full Cast & Crew|dated=|website=IMDB|accessed=2 September 2022}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAbigail was from the southlands of [[Middle-earth]], though her home was attacked by [[Orcs]], and she had to flee with a group of companions. Along with [[Halbrand]], [[Eamon (The Rings of Power)|Eamon]], [[Astrid (The Rings of Power)|Astrid]], [[Doble]], and two other castaways, Abigail was eventually were stranded in the midst of the [[Sundering Seas]] after their ship was destroyed by a sea monster known only as \"the worm\".\n\nAfter two weeks at sea, Abigail spotted [[Galadriel]] swimming near their ship. Believing her to be a fellow [[Men|Woman]], Abigail took pity on Galadriel and helped her onto the wreckage, giving her drinking water. However, with Eamon and the others being suspicious, Abigail was shocked when she learned that Galadriel was an [[Elves|Elf]], believing that she had been deceived. At that very moment, another castaway pointed out that a ship was approaching, though they realized that it was the wreckage of their own ship being dragged along by \"the worm.\" In the ensuing attack, all except Galadriel and Halbrand were lost at sea.\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:The Rings of Power (TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Men from adaptations]]"}}}
