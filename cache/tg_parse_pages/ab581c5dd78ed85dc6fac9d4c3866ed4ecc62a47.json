He was the greatest, most powerful wolf to ever live. Carcharoth was set as a guard on the [[Gates of Angband]], and later he mortally wounded both [[Huan]], the Hound of Valinor, and [[Beren]].<ref name=S19>{{S|19}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAfter hearing of the Fall of [[Tol-in-Gaurhoth]], where Huan had defeated [[Draugluin]] and [[Sauron]], Morgoth decided to create a werewolf to kill Huan, who could only be killed by the greatest wolf to have ever lived. Carcharoth became involved with the [[Quest for the Silmaril]] when Beren and [[Lúthien]] had to pass him on their way into [[Angband]]. He stopped them, suspicious of Draugluin, (Beren in disguise) as he had heard of Draugluin's death. Lúthien enchanted him with her magic, but on their way out Carcharoth attacked before Lúthien could enchant him again. Beren held out the captured [[Silmaril]] in an attempt to stay the beast, but Carcharoth bit off Beren's hand at the wrist with Silmaril and all.\n[[File:Ted Nasmith - Huan's Leap 2.jpg|thumb|left|''Huan's Leap'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]\nThe Silmaril burnt away Carcharoth's insides, and he became crazed with pain. A terror to [[Eldar]], Men and [[Orcs]] alike, he passed south through [[Beleriand]], consumed with an overpowering thirst. From this comes his name of '''Anfauglir''', meaning 'Jaws of Thirst'. He arrived in [[Doriath]] where Beren, King [[Thingol]], [[Beleg|Beleg Cúthalion]] and [[Mablung]] joined with [[Huan the Hound]] in the [[Hunting of the Wolf]].\n\nAt last, he was discovered within the borders of Doriath itself, where he fought his last fight with Huan: the wolf and the hound took one another's lives in that combat. \n\nBoth Beren and Huan were mortally wounded. When Mablung cut open the belly of the beast, he found there the Silmaril with Beren's hand still around it, but when he touched the flesh it was no more.<ref name=S19/>\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{Pronounce|Carcharoth.mp3|Ardamir}}\nThe name is translated as Red Maw;<ref name=S19/> the recogniseable [[Sindarin]] elements are ''[[caran|car(a)n]]'' (\"red\") as well as ''[[carach]]'' (\"jaw\")<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, ''carak-'' and ''caran''</ref> or [[carch]] (\"fang\").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, \"KARAK\"</ref> Based on the above, perhaps the name can be analyzed into the unattested words *''carn'' (an alternate version of ''caran'') and *''caroth'' (\"maw\"), the latter ending with the augmentative suffix ''-oth'' also seen in ''[[Nogoth]]'' \"(Big) Dwarf\" = ''[[naug]]'' + ''oth''<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 45</ref> (\"maw\" = \"big jaw\").\n\nNote that the final letter of ''car(a)'''n''''' + the initial letter of '''''c'''arach/oth-'' produce the sound '''ch''' (IPA: {{IPA|x}}) with the phenomenon called [[nasal mutation]].<ref>{{S|Note}}</ref><ref>{{App|E1i}}</ref>\n\nHis later name ''Anfauglir'', is probably composed of Sindarin ''[[and]]'' (\"long\") + ''[[faug]]'' (\"thirst\") + ''lîr'' (\"jaws\").<ref>[http://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/compound_sindarin_names Compound Sindarin Names]</ref>\n\n== Genealogy ==\n{{familytree/start}}\n{{familytree| DRA | |DRA=[[Draugluin]]<br /><small>''d. {{FA|465}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree| |:| | |}}\n{{familytree| CAR | |CAR='''CARCHAROTH'''<br /><small>''d. {{FA|466}}''</small>}}\n{{familytree/end}}\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nOriginally Carcharoth's name was '''''Karkaras''''', the Knife-fang, who was the father of wolves.
