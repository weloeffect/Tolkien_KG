These corrections, for a reason unknown to me, were not incorporated in the [[Allen and Unwin]] Second Edition, but they did occur in a later impression of the [[Ballantine]] edition of [[1966]], and hence Estella Bolger and her marriage to Merry Brandybuck are entered in ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'' by [[Robert Foster]].''\n\n''These additions to the family trees were made at the instance of [[Douglas A. Anderson]] in the [[Houghton Mifflin]] edition of [[1987]], to which he contributed a note on the history of the text.  Estella Bolger and her marriage to Meriadoc have finally entered the British 'tradition' in the re-set edition published by [[HarperCollins]] in [[1994]] (see Douglas Anderson's 'Note on the text' in this edition, p. xii).''\"<ref>{{PM|III}}, p. 117 (note 1)</ref>\n\n==Excerpt==\n[Tolkien's added lines:]\n{{blockquote|I believe he married a sister of<br/>[[Fredegar Bolger|Fredegar (Fatty) Bolger]], but I<br/>will look into the matter.
