East of the river Gilrain was the fief of [[Lebennin]]. In the south the coast of Belfalas lay the [[Bay of Belfalas]]. The fief of Lamedon was north of Belfalas at the foot of the [[White Mountains]]. The castle of [[Dol Amroth]] was located in the west of Belfalas on a high promontory that formed the southern end of the small bay of [[Cobas Haven]] into which the Ringló flowed.<ref name=Map/> The Elven haven of [[Edhellond]] was about 50 miles north of Dol Amroth south of the confluence of the river [[Morthond]] with the river Ringló.<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nWhen the forces of [[Morgoth]] overwhelmed the [[Elves]] and [[Atani]] towards the end of the [[First Age]], a group of [[Sindar]] fled in three small ships from the western havens of [[Beleriand]] and established the haven and a small settlement of [[Edhellond]]<ref name=Amroth>{{UT|Amroth}}, Note 18</ref> at the south of the confluence of the river [[Morthond]] with the river Ringló north of the hill that was later named [[Dol Amroth]] in the Third Age.

After the [[Downfall of Númenor]] [[Elendil]], the new [[High King (Dúnedain)|High King]] of the [[Realms in Exile]] of Arnor and Gondor, granted them the title \"Prince\"<ref name=CirionN39/><ref>{{UT|Eorl}}</ref> and their land became a fief<ref name=Fief/> of [[Gondor]] and was called [[Dor-en-Ernil]] (\"Land of the Prince\").<ref>{{UT|Amroth}}, note 14</ref>\n\nIn {{TA|1981}} [[Amroth]], the [[King of Lórien]], left his [[Lothlórien|realm]] with his beloved [[Nimrodel]] to sail to [[Aman]] from Edhellond, because Nimrodel wanted to flee to a land of peace from the [[Balrog|terror]] that came out of [[Moria]] and that had driven out the [[Dwarves]]. Amroth became separated from Nimrodel who got lost in the [[White Mountains]] and waited for her on the last ship that was anchoring at Edhellond. When the ship was blown prematurely out to sea, he jumped overboard in a futile attempt to reach the shore to search for her and drowned in the bay. The last of the Elves of Edhellond left Middle-earth on that ship.<ref name=Amroth/>\n\nAfter the drowning of Amroth, the hill on which the stronghold of the Princes of Belfalas was located was called Dol Amroth (the \"Hill of Amroth\") and [[Galador]], the son of [[Imrazôr]], who according to legend had married the Elven-lady [[Mithrellas]], a companion of Nimrodel, became known as the first [[Prince of Dol Amroth]].<ref name=CirionN39/>\n\nDuring the [[War of the Ring]], the nearby city of [[Linhir]] was attacked by the [[Corsairs of Umbar]] and the [[Haradrim]] and Men of [[Lamedon]] under [[Angbor]] tried to keep them off, until the [[Grey Company]] with the [[wraiths]] of the [[Oathbreakers]] arrived and ended the conflict.<ref>{{RK|Debate}}</ref>\n\n==Population==\nThe people of Belfalas were mostly descendents of Númenórean settlers. They frequently used [[Adûnaic]] names out of tradition, because their Númenórean ancestors had settled in Befalas before the division of the Númenóreans into the Faithful and the King's Men and the use of Adûnaic was at that time not connected with a rebellion against the Valar.<ref name=Beards/>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Belfalas'' consists of ''[[bel]]'', (a [[Pre-Númenórean]] element of unknown meaning) and the [[Sindarin]] word ''[[falas]]'' (\"shore\").<ref name=VT>{{VT|42a}}, p. 15</ref>\n\n==Portrayal in adaptations==\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Belfalas map.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Belfalas in''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'' ]]\n'''2014: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n:The Havens of Belfalas were an area in the region of Western [[Gondor]]. They were located south of the [[Blackroot Vale]] via \"Tarlang's Crown\" and south-west of [[Lamedon]]. The \"Emyn Ernil\" lay to the east, dividing Belfalas from [[Dor-en-Ernil]]. A later update added the Cape of Belfalas, a location for Gondor-themed player homes along the coast between the Havens and Dor-en-Ernil. The capital was [[Dol Amroth]] and other settlements included \"Tadrent\" and \"Ost Lontir\". There were two [[Warning beacons of Gondor|beacons]] in Belfalas, on the north edges of the Emyn Ernil: \"Amon Lontir\" and \"Nendath\". The small island \"Tol Aduial\" was in the bay north of Dol Amroth and the larger island \"Tol Fennas\" was west of Dol Amroth. A reclusive group of [[Elves]], the \"Avorrim\", kept watch upon the abandoned haven of [[Edhellond]] in secret.\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Regions of Gondor]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[de:Belfalas]]\n[[fr:encyclo:geographie:regions:gondor:belfalas]]\n[[fi:Belfalas]]"}}}
