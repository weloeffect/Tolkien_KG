Bilbo forestalled them by creating a will that would transfer ownership of the valuable property to his cousin [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]].<ref name=\"Party\"/> On [[23 September|September 23]],<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> the day after the party, Otho and Lobelia came to Bag End and demanded to see the will. Otho read the will but could find no fault, and stumped off in disgust.<ref name=\"Party\"/>\n \n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nWhen he wrote the fifth version of the first chapter of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] included the information that Otho was a lawyer and that Bingo<ref group=\"note\">Bingo Bolger-Baggins later became Frodo Baggins.</ref> would legally enter into ownership at midnight on [[23 September]].<ref>{{RS|Return}}</ref>\n \nIn a note, [[Christopher Tolkien]] gave the full text of Bilbo's will:<ref>{{RS|2XIVN}}, note 22</ref>\n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nBilbo (son of [[Bungo Baggins|Bungo]] son of [[Mungo Baggins|Mungo]] son of Inigo<ref group=\"note\">Bilbo's great-grandfather would later be named [[Balbo Baggins]].</ref>) Baggins hereinafter called the testator, now departing being the rightful owner of all properties and goods hereinafter named hereby devises, makes over, and bequeathes the property and [[Wikipedia:Messuage|messuage]] or dwelling-hole know as Bag-End [[Underhill (village)|Underhill]] near [[Hobbiton]] with all lands thereto belonging and annexed to his cousin and adopted heir Bingo (son of [[Drogo Baggins|Drogo]] son of Togo<ref group=\"note\">The name 'Togo' would later be given to one of the [[Goodbody Family|Goodbodies]] and replaced by [[Fosco Baggins]].</ref> son of Inigo<ref group=\"note\">Inigo as Bingo's great-grandfather would be replaced by [[Largo Baggins]].</ref>) Baggins hereinafter called the heir, for him to have hold possess occupy let on lease sell or otherwise dispose of at his pleasure as from midnight of the twenty-second day of September in the one hundred and eleventh or eleventy-first year of the aforesaid Bilbo Baggins.
