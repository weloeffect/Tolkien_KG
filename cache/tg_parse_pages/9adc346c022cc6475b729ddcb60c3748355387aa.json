O Lady Throned beyond the Stars''''', originally called '''''Consolatrix Afflictorum''''' or '''''Stella Vespertina''''' is a poem by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] written in September [[1916]] during his military training. It is devoted to the [[Virgin Mary]] and begins with \"''O Lady Mother throned amid the stars''\".<ref>{{CG|2I}}, p. 30</ref> \n\n[[Holly Ordway]] claims that Tolkien derived both names of the poem from the [[Litany of Loreto]], a prayer that invokes the Virgin Mary. \"''Consolatrix afflictorum''\" is a [[Latin]] phrase that means \"[[:Wikipedia:Our Lady of Consolation|consoler of the afflicted]]\" and is one of the many honorifics used in the Litany to address the Virgin Mary. \"''Stella vespertina''\" (\"[[Evenstar|evening star]]\") is not a Marian title used in the Litany, but \"''stella matutina''\" (\"morning star\") is. According to Ordway, Tolkien had the latter in mind but chose to substitute \"evening\" for \"morning\" because he felt it was more applicable to his physical and spiritual struggle in the trenches.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhUKyxbR1W4&t=1938s Interview with Holly Ordway], author of ''[[Tolkien's Faith: A Spiritual Biography]]'', uploaded to YouTube channel \"[https://www.youtube.com/@word-on-fire Word on Fire Institute]\", minute 32:18</ref>\n\nLike many other early poems by Tolkien, it remains [[Index:Unpublished material|unpublished]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Index:Poems by J.R.R.
