He ruled the Noldor as High King from {{FA|456}}, following the death of his father in single combat with [[Morgoth]]. However, Fingon is mostly remembered for his friendship with Maedhros, who he rescued from the peaks of [[Thangorodrim]], and for the manner of his death in battle with the [[Balrog]] [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]] during the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]].

Fëanor's people secretly took all the [[Swan-ships]] and passed over the sea to land at [[Firth of Drengist]]; [[Maedhros]] - who was friendly with Fingon - wanted to send the ships back first to retrieve \"Fingon the valiant\" but Fëanor burnt the ships at [[Losgar]].<ref name=\"Flight\"/> Fingon, with the rest of the Noldor of Fingolfin and his cousin [[Finrod]], had to cross the dangerous grinding ice of [[Helcaraxë]] with much loss of life.

Fingon resolved to rebuild the relationship between these two great houses of the Noldor, so in {{FA|5}} went on a noble quest to Thangorodrim to rescue his cousin and friend Maedhros who had previously been captured by [[Morgoth]]. Travelling alone, and unseen in the darkness, Fingon climbed across the cracks and crevices of Thangorodrim but could not find Maedhros. Then, in both despair and defiance, he took out his harp and sang a fair song of Valinor. Suddenly, above him,his song was taken up, and Maedhros sang among his torment. However, Fingon could not climb up to him and so Maedhros begged Fingon to shoot him with his bow. But, as Fingon cried to [[Manwë]] to \"speed now this feathered shaft\", the great [[Eagles|eagle]] [[Thorondor]] swooped down and lifted Fingon up. Fingon could not break Maedhros's chains - being of evil design by Morgoth - and although Maedhros begged Fingon to kill him, Fingon cut Maedhros's hand off at the wrist to free him. Borne back to [[Hithlum]] by Thorondor, Fingon's deed was praised as one of the most mighty amongst the Noldor.

To the west, battle took place in Hithlum, and Fingon would have succumbed had it not been for a force of [[Falathrim]] elves under the command of [[Círdan]] who sailed up the [[Firth of Drengist]] and helped defeat the Orcs.<ref name=\"Ruin\" />\n\n===Nirnaeth Arnoediad===\n[[File:Steamey - Fingon in a battle with the Balrogs.jpg|thumb|right|''Fingon in a battle with the Balrogs'' by Steamey]]\nFollowing the success of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] in the [[Quest for the Silmaril]], [[Maedhros]] saw that Morgoth was not unassailable and was emboldened to form the [[Union of Maedhros]] of Elves, Men and [[Dwarves]]. Maedhros would attack from the east and Fingon from the west. They planned to trap Morgoth between the two armies.<ref name=\"Fifth\">{{S|Fifth}}</ref> Unlooked for, Fingon's brother [[Turgon]] unleashed a force of ten thousand Elves from [[Gondolin]]. On seeing this, Fingon cried:\n\n{{blockquote|'[[Utúlie'n aurë!]] Aiya Eldalië ar Atanatári, utúlie'n aurë! The day has come! Behold, people of the Eldar and Fathers of Men, the day has come!' And all those who heard his great voice echo in the hills answered crying: 'Auta i lómë! The night is passing!'|''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', \"[[Of the Fifth Battle]]\"}}\n\nHowever, Maedhros' army had been delayed following the betrayal of [[Uldor]]. [[Morgoth]] therefore sent his Orcs swiftly over the Anfauglith to taunt Fingon and draw out his forces. They held firm until the Orcs brought forth [[Gelmir (son of Guilin)|Gelmir]] and cut off his legs, arms and head before them. [[Gwindor]], Gelmir's brother, was enraged by this; and he, with Fingon, led the charge. Gwindor and the elves of [[Nargothrond]] reached the doors of Angband but they were all slain save Gwindor, who was taken captive, for Fingon could not come to his aid in time.<ref name=\"Fifth\" /> \n\nOn the fourth day, Fingon retreated and met his brother Turgon on the plains of Anfauglith. Some hours later, the banners of [[Maedhros]] appeared on the battlefield and the Elves were heartened, believing victory was in their grasp. However, Morgoth then unleashed [[wolves]], dragons and Balrogs led by [[Glaurung]], who separated the hosts of Fingon and Turgon from Maedhros. This battle, the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], the Battle of Unnumbered Tears, was the most grievous for the Elves. Fingon, with a host of Men from [[Dor-lómin]] led by [[Húrin]], was surrounded. Eventually, being pushed back, Fingon fought [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]], lord of [[Balrogs]] in battle, but was killed by Gothmog's black axe after another Balrog bound him with a whip. They beat him into the dust with their maces, and his banner, they trod into the mire of his blood. This brought an end to Fingon's realm in [[Hithlum]], and his brother Turgon became High King of the Noldor,<ref name=\"Fifth\" /> whilst Húrin was captured and tortured personally by Morgoth.<ref name=\"Narn\" />\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{Pronounce|Fingon.mp3|Ardamir}}\n''Fingon'' is the [[Sindarized]] version of version of his [[Quenya]] [[father-name]], '''''Findecáno''''' (\"Hair-shout\"), from ''[[findë]]'' (\"hair\") + ''[[káno]]'' (\"commander\").

Furthermore, before his death Tolkien corrected the last of the genealogical tables, where Fingon's wife and chidren (including [[Erien]] and [[Finbor]]) were struck out, and thus in ''[[The Shibboleth of Fëanor]]'' Fingon was once and for all mentioned as wifeless and childless elf-lord.<ref name=Shibboleth/><ref name=Galad/><ref>{{WJ|Ruin}}, pp. 242-3</ref>\n\n{{references|notes}}\n\n{{seq-start}}\n{{seq-head\n|race=noldor\n|house=[[House of Fingolfin]]<small><br/>Cadet branch of [[House of Finwë]]</small>\n|born={{YT|1260}}\n|died={{FA|472}}\n}}\n{{seq\n|pvac=\n|prev=[[Fingolfin]]\n|list=2nd [[High King of the Noldor]]\n|dates={{FA|456}} – {{FA|472|n}}\n|next=[[Turgon]]\n}}\n{{seq-end}}\n\n[[Category:Calaquendi]]\n[[Category:Characters in The Silmarillion]]\n[[Category:First Age characters]]\n[[Category:House of Fingolfin]]\n[[Category:Noldor]]\n[[Category:Noldorin names]]\n[[Category:Rulers in Beleriand]]\n[[Category:Sindarin names]]\n[[de:Fingon]]\n[[fr:/encyclo/personnages/elfes/noldor/fingon]]\n[[fi:Fingon]]"}}}
