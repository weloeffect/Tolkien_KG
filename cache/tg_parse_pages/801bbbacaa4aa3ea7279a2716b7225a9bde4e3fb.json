Beyond Tolkien's [[Middle-earth]], a large part of the map depicts newly invented areas that were featured in modules for the role-playing game.\n\nPeter Fenlon also wrote a gazetteer based on the geographical names used on the map. The gazetteer was only published by [[Iron Crown Enterprises|ICE]] on the internet and is now off-line.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://web.archive.org/web/19980429095342/http://ironcrown.com/GamesInfo/MERP/Continent/Graphics/Endor.html Fenlon's descriptions of newly invented areas] (archived)\n\n[[Category:MERP maps]]"}}}
