Although the easterners had better weapons the North King's host was more numerous and they won. The victory had inspired songs sung for generations afterwards. The battle of Ishmalog was also where [[Buldar]] of [[Agar]] obtained a wound, a sword, and a woman. The woman was a captive and Buldar took her to wife. From their union came [[Hazad Longbeard]] and from him came [[Tal-Elmar (character)|Tal-Elmar]].<ref>{{PM|Elmar}}</ref>\n\n== Other versions of the legendarium ==\nIn a rejected version of the story the name of the valley was ''Rishmalog''.<ref>{{PM|Elmar}}, note 4</ref>\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Mannish words]]\n[[Category:Valleys]]"}}}
