At its southern end the Ered Lómin met the range of the [[Ered Wethrin]] and so walled off Hithlum and its lesser lands from [[Beleriand]] to the south. The Ered Lómin was broken by the inlet of the Firth of [[Drengist]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>\n\nIt was through the Firth of Drengist in these mountains that [[Fëanor]] led his followers among the [[Noldor]] back into [[Middle-earth]].<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Ered Lómin'' means ''Echoing Mountains'', but the origin of the name is uncertain. According to some sources, it refers to the echoes of the great cry of [[Morgoth]] as he returned into Middle-earth with [[Ungoliant]] before Fëanor's own return.<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref> According to others, it was merely in the nature of these mountains to produce great echoes. Whatever the origin of the name, it was clearly shared by the land of [[Dor-lómin]], that lay to the south-east of these mountains.\n\n{{references}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ered Lomin}}\n[[Category:Beleriand]]\n[[Category:Mountain ranges]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[de:Ered Lómin]]\n[[fi:Ered Lómin]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/reliefs/beleriand/ered lomin]]"}}}
