He was the last of the Second Line.<ref name=\"Mark\">{{App|Mark}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Early life===\nThéoden was the only son of [[Thengel]], the heir of king [[Fengel]] of [[Rohan]], and [[Morwen of Lossarnach]], a descendant of a former [[Prince of Dol Amroth|prince]] of the fief of [[Belfalas]].<ref name=\"Mark\" /><ref name=\"Linear\">{{UT|Linear}}</ref> His father left Rohan when he came to manhood and lived long in Gondor. Théoden had been born in [[Gondor]] and spent at least the first five years of his life there with his mother and father until his father was called back to Rohan after the death of Théoden's grandfather Fengel.\n\n[[Westron]],<ref name=\"DwarvesIntro\">{{PM|XIntro}}</ref> the \"speech of Gondor\", was used in his father's house in Rohan<ref name=\"Mark\" />{{rp|1069}}. Théoden spoke Westron as his native language<ref name=\"DwarvesIntro\" /> and he also spoke [[Rohanese]] and [[Sindarin]].<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, note 2, p. 316</ref> It is not known if Sindarin and Rohanese were his native languages or his acquired languages. His mother Morwen was a \"lady of Gondor of high Númenórean descent\".<ref name=\"Linear\" /> In Gondor all men of high lineage and all those who learned how to read and write used Sindarin, even as a daily language, and it is said that in some families Sindarin was the native language.<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}, p. 296</ref>\n\nThéoden loved his sister [[Théodwyn]] dearly. After she and her husband both died he adopted her children [[Éomer]] and [[Éowyn]] as his own. He had a son, [[Théodred]], whose mother [[Elfhild]] died in childbirth.<ref name=\"Mark\" />\n\nThéoden became king after the death of his father in {{TA|2980}}.<ref name=\"Mark\" />\n\nIn {{TA|3014}} Théoden's health began to fail. This was caused by the spells of [[Saruman|Saruman the White]].<ref name=\"Mark\" /> This may have been due to natural causes as he was then sixty-six, though Rohirrim often lived past eighty, or it may have been induced or increased by subtle poisons administered by [[Gríma]].<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref> Gríma (or ''Wormtongue'' as most others in the [[Riddermark|Mark]] called him), was secretly in the employ of Saruman.\n\n===War of the Ring===\nAs the war approached Théoden was increasingly misled by his chief adviser Gríma. In the last years before the War of the Ring, Théoden let his rule slip out of his hands completely, and Gríma became increasingly powerful. Rohan was troubled again by [[Orcs]] and [[Dunlendings]], who operated under the will of Saruman, ruling from [[Isengard]]. \n\nHis only son, Théodred, had only recently been slain by Saruman's forces during the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]]. Théoden ordered Éomer against hunting Orcs that crossed Rohan but Éomer went to the foray against his orders.<ref name=\"appB\">{{App|Great}}</ref> On Gríma's orders Éomer had been arrested and imprisoned for this.<ref name=\"Hall\">{{TT|III6}}</ref>\n\nWhen [[Gandalf]] and [[Aragorn]] appeared before him on [[2 March]], the [[Wizards|Wizard]] healed the king. He then restored his nephew, who would become his heir, took up his [[Herugrim|sword]], and led the [[Rohirrim|Riders of Rohan]] to the [[Fords of Isen]], against Saruman.<ref name=\"appB\" /> \n\nOn their way, they received news that [[Second Battle of the Fords of Isen|the border was lost]] and he retreated into [[Helm's Deep]] where they were attacked by Saruman's forces on [[3 March]].<ref name=\"appB\" /> Théoden won the [[Battle of the Hornburg]] and after this he became known as '''Théoden Ednew''', the Renewed,<ref name=\"Mark\" /> because he had thrown off the yoke of Saruman.\n\nAfter the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], Théoden visited [[Isengard]], where he witnessed [[Gandalf]] deposing Saruman from [[Wizards|their order]]. During the parley before the tower of [[Orthanc]], [[Saruman]] attempted to deceive Théoden with false offers of peace and friendship. When Théoden rejected him, [[Saruman]] mockingly referred to him as a \"'''Horsemaster'''\" as an insult<ref>{{TT|III10}}</ref><ref>{{App|B3}}</ref>. On their way back to Rohan, they stopped by the [[Helm's Deep]], where he noticed that the lonely [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of their company, [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] felt out of place, and offered to ride with him for the rest of the journey. The hobbit was delighted, as he felt useless among the Riders and offered Théoden his sword in service of Rohan.<ref>{{RK|V2}}</ref>\n\nOn [[6 March]] Théoden and the Riders left Hornburg for [[Harrowdale]] taking a safe path to Edoras, and soon after [[Aragorn]] left the Rohirrim's company for [[Dunharrow]].<ref name=\"appB\" /> Near the outer hills of Rohan, Théoden dismissed Éomer's urge not to go to the war, and with the remaining Riders he rode to the Hold of Dunharrow where his people took shelter at [[Dunharrow]].<ref name=\"muster\">{{RK|V3}}</ref>\n\n===Fulfilling the Oath of Eorl===\n[[File:Paula DiSante - The Red Arrow.JPG|thumb|[[Paula DiSante]] - ''The Red Arrow'']]\nAfter reuniting with Éowyn and while resting, a [[Gondorian]] named [[Hirgon]] entered his tent, bringing the [[Red Arrow]] from [[Denethor]] II. Théoden responded to him that 6000 Riders would reach [[Minas Tirith]] in the week. Indeed they set off the [[Dawnless Day|next morning]]; before leaving he ordered his squire, Meriadoc, to stay behind at Edoras.<ref name=\"muster\" />\n\nOn their way to Minas Tirith, Théoden's forces were alerted to a host of Orcs upon the road from the city moving towards them. A leader of the [[Woses]], [[Ghân-buri-Ghân]], offered to lead the Rohirrim by secret paths through the [[Drúadan Forest]] so they could avoid the Orcs. Taking the forgotten road down [[Stonewain Valley]] the riders of Rohan were able to come to the [[Pelennor Fields]] undetected.\n[[File:Abe Papakhian - The Ride of the Rohirrim.jpg|thumb|left|[[Abe Papakhian]] - ''The Ride of the Rohirrim'']]\nTo his dismay, they found Hirgon dead and understood that the Gondorians were unaware of their arrival; Minas Tirith [[Siege of Gondor|was being destroyed]]. Théoden was reinvigorated by a sudden great flash of light from the city. He ordered to charge as the [[Storm of Mordor|Darkness]] was fading. He led the Rohirrim to the aid of Gondor at the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. In that battle he challenged a chieftain of the [[Haradrim]] who led their cavalry and had a standard with a \"black serpent upon scarlet\", and unhorsed him and hewed down his standard-bearer.<ref>{{RK|V5}}</ref>\n[[File:Angus McBride - Eowyn against Witch-king.gif|thumb|[[Angus McBride]] - ''Eowyn against Witch-king'']]\nThe [[Witch-king|Lord of the Nazgûl]] attacked him, and he was mortally wounded when his horse [[Snowmane]] fell upon him after being frightened by the Ringwraith's [[Fell beasts|Fell beast]].\n\nHe was immediately avenged by Éowyn and the [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]], both of whom had ridden to war in secret.
