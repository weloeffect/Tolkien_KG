All peoples, Good and Evil, were known to have used them, most notably the [[Elves]], [[Númenóreans]], [[Rohirrim]], [[Orcs]], and even [[Hobbits]].<ref>[[Anthony Burdge]], [[Jessica Burke]], \"Weapons, Named\"; in ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia: Scholarship and Critical Assessment]]'' (edited by [[Michael D.C. Drout]])</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nBows varied widely in shape, size and materials. While [[Elves|Elven]] flawless bows were made from wood, [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] bows were made of hollow steel, forged in armories.<ref name=Numenor>{{UT|Numenor}}, p. 170</ref> It is said in a poem that [[Eärendil]] wielded a bow \"made of dragon-horn\".<ref>{{FR|Earendil}}</ref>\n\n==Bows by faction==\n* Elves were the first race to develop and master the use of bows, and later passed their knowledge on to [[Men]].\n** Among the [[Gondothlim|Elves of Gondolin]], the [[house of the Swallow]] and the [[house of the Heavenly Arch]] used bows as their primary weapons.  \n** The [[Elves]] of [[Doriath]] and [[Lothlórien]] used longbows which were, as their name suggests, longer bows which could shoot farther and higher than any other types of bows. \n** Bows were a prominent weapon of the [[Elves of Mirkwood]]. Archers and spearmen formed the bulk of the [[Woodland Realm]]'s army during the [[Battle of the Five Armies]] near [[Erebor]].<ref name=\"H|17\">{{H|17}}</ref>\n\n* [[Númenóreans]] used the steel-bow, which as its name implies, was made of hollow steel. \"In later days, in the wars upon Middle-Earth, it was the bows of the Númenóreans that were most greatly feared. 'The Men of the Sea,' it was said, 'send before them a great cloud, as of rain turned to serpents, or a black hail tipped with steel...'\". It shot black-feathered arrows that were a full ell long from point to notch<ref name=Numenor/> and much feared by their enemies.<ref>{{UT|Gladden}}, p. 273</ref>\n** Among the royal heirlooms of the [[Kings of Númenor]] was the [[Bow of Bregor]].<ref>{{UT|3a}}, p. 171</ref> The Númenoreans were also the only known culture in Arda to have developed [[Cross-bows|crossbows]], used primarily for bird hunting.<ref>{{NM|P3xiii}}, p. 340</ref> \n\n* The [[Gondorians|Gondorian]] army contains units of archers who use longbows. These bows are made of heartwood and reach about 68 inches tall. The arrows are about 28 inches long with four-inch steel tips, and accurate up to 200 yards. The longbowmen of the army wear their quiver (the case that holds the arrows) on their hips rather than on their backs like most archers. Bows were also the primary weapon of the [[Rangers of Ithilien]].<ref>{{HM|TT}}</ref>\n\n* [[Rohirrim]] archers used shortbows; as they fought primarily from horseback, a longbow would be impractical. The shortbows were much less powerful than those used by other [[Men]], having a range of only 125 yards.\n\n* The various [[Northmen]] nations, including the [[Men of Dale]] and [[Lake-men]], used bows for hunting and warfare alike. \n** [[Bard the Bowman]] was a notable archer from Lake-town and played a key role in the slaying of the dragon [[Smaug]] with the [[black arrow]].<ref>{{H|14}}</ref> \n** [[Beorn]], a skinchanger affiliated with the [[Beornings]], supplied Thorin and his company with a few hunting bows before they headed east towards Mirkwood.<ref>{{H|7}}</ref> \n** The [[King of Rhovanion|Kings of Rhovanion]] from earlier centuries of the Third Age also employed mounted bowmen (a form of mounted infantry, rather than cavalry) as scouts within their realm.<ref>{{UT|8}}</ref>\n\n* [[Hobbits]] also used bows. Hobbit archers fought for [[Arnor]] in the [[Battle of Fornost]],<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref> and also participated in the [[Battle of Bywater]].<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>\n\n* [[Dwarves]] used bows less prominently than other races, but counted them among their military weapons. Dwarven bows were shortbows made of horn, or of a composite build using horn and wood. [[Thorin Oakenshield]] used a bow to threaten the [[Elves of Mirkwood|Mirkwood Elves]] and the [[Men of Dale]] when he was reluctant to part with the treasures of [[Erebor]].<ref name=\"H|17\"/>\n\n* [[Orcs]] used bows for hunting, as well as weapons of war. Orc bows were made of horn, although the [[Uruk-hai]] of [[Isengard]] were known to use longer bows in the fashion of Men, which were made of yew.<ref>{{TT|Departure}}</ref>\n\n==Notable bowmen==\n[[File:Anke Eißmann - Numenorean steel-bows.jpg|thumb|''Númenórean steel-bows'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]\n* [[Duilin (elf of Gondolin)|Duilin]], a lord of [[Gondolin]], along with his [[House of the Swallow]].\n* [[Beleg|Beleg Cúthalion]], who bore [[Belthronding]].\n* [[Bard]], who slew the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Smaug]] with his yew bow and [[black arrow]].\n* [[Legolas]], a member of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]].\n\n==Other names==\n*[[Quenya]]: ''quinga''\n*[[Sindarin]]/[[Noldorin]]: ''ping'', ''cú''\n*[[Nandorin]]: ''cogn''\n\nThe forms ''quinga'', ''ping'' are cognates deriving from the [[Primitive Quendian]] ''kwingā''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry \"KWIG\" (in that source the first word is spelled ''qinga'', and the second is [[Noldorin]].</ref>\n\nThe form ''cogn'', is derived from [[Primitive Quendian]] ''kuȝnā'', itself representing the [[root]] KUȜ.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry \"KUȜ\", p. 365</ref>\n\n==Inspirations==\nIt is possible Tolkien's fascination with bows came from Red Indian stories:\n{{blockquote|Red Indians were better: there were bows and arrows (I had and have a wholly unsatisfied desire to shoot well with a bow)|[[On Fairy-Stories]]}}\n\n{{blockquote|But he [Tolkien] liked Red Indian stories and longed to shoot with a bow and arrow.|[[Humphrey Carpenter]], ''[[J.R.R.
