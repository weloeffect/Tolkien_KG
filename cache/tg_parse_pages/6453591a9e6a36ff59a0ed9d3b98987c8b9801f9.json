The town itself is situated on the side of the hill while around it are many fields. There is also a place called the [[Moot-hill]], where the town-master gives meetings and announcements.\n\n=== Geography ===\nOn its location little information is given, except that it was a region of green hills, situated \"three leagues away\" from the shores of the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]], and apparently closer to the ocean than the rival town of [[Udul]]. In a note near the end of the story there was a suggestion that the place was on the estuary of the [[Isen]] or perhaps the [[Morthond]]. There is also a hill between Agar and the sea known as the [[Golden Hill]].\n\n== Politics ==\nThe town was ruled by a town-master, who is known as the [[Master of Agar]]. The town-master during the time when Tal-Elmar lived in the town was named [[Mogru]].<ref>{{PM|Elmar}}</ref>\n\n== Folk of Agar ==\n* [[Buldar]]\n* [[Elmar]]\n* [[Hazad]]\n* [[Tal-Elmar (character)|Tal-Elmar]]\n* [[Mogru]]\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Cities, towns and villages]]\n[[Category:Mannish words]]\n[[Category:Regions]]\n[[de:Agar]]\n[[fi:Agar]]"}}}
