It began with a failed sortie by [[Glaurung]]<ref name=Return>{{S|Return}}</ref> in the [[coranar|year]] {{FA|260|n}}<ref name=\"GA260\">{{GA|260}}</ref> and ended with the [[Dagor Bragollach]]<ref name=Fingolfin>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> in {{FA|455|n}}<ref>{{GA|145}}</ref> 195 years later.\n\nDuring this period the [[Elves of Beleriand]] prospered, with only minor conflicts with the [[Orcs]]. It was also during the Long Peace that the [[Edain]] passed into [[Beleriand]] from the [[Eriador|east]].\n\n==History==\nThe [[Siege of Angband]] held the forces of [[Darkness]] within [[Angband]]. [[Glaurung]] the Worm attempted to break it, managing to drive the [[Noldor]] off [[Ard-galen]], however he was too young, and was pushed back by [[Fingon]]. It was then decided that Glaurung should wait to mature until ready to strike back.<ref name=Return>{{S|Return}}</ref> This long wait allowed for the races of Beleriand to recover and prosper.\n\nThe first major event during those years was the arrival of the [[Edain]] into Beleriand, looking for the land of the [[Valar|Gods]] in the [[Uttermost West|West]]. [[Finrod]] quickly befriended these first [[Men]] and advised them to settle in [[Estolad]] in the realm of [[Amrod]].<ref>{{S|West}}</ref> \n\nAround that time, the [[Haladin]], the [[Folk of Marach]], and the [[Easterlings (First Age)|Easterlings]] crossed over the [[Blue Mountains]] into Beleriand. The Haladin dwelt in [[Thargelion]] as scattered groups until a host of orcs [[Battle of the Gelion-Ascar Stockade|assaulted]] their territory in {{FA|375}}. They built [[Gelion-Ascar Stockade|a stockade]] between the angle of [[Gelion]] until [[Caranthir]]'s army could relieve them. [[Haleth]], who had become [[Chieftain of the Haladin|Chieftain]] following the death of her father and brother, declined a fief in his lands and moved on to [[Talath Dirnen]] to settle in the [[Forest of Brethil]].\n\nIn {{FA|402}}, [[Orcs]] attempted to break through the [[Pass of Aglon]], but the people of [[Bëor]] helped [[Maedhros]] and [[Maglor]] threw back the invaders.<ref>{{GA|125}}</ref> This was the first time Men fought on behalf of the [[Eldar]]. Their head was also given the region of [[Ladros]] of [[Dorthonion]]. \n\nThe Marachians remained in Estolad after the Beorians, becoming close allies with the [[House of Fingolfin]] in [[Hithlum]] and then moved to the southern slopes of the [[Ered Wethrin]]; during the time of [[Hador]] in {{FA|416}} they were granted permanent fief of [[Dor-lómin]].\n\nDuring this time, Angband also built its forces and Glaurung grew stronger. The period ended when finally the Siege was broken in the [[Dagor Bragollach]].<ref name=Fingolfin>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Periods]]\n[[fi:Pitkä rauha]]"}}}
