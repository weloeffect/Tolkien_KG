There he dwelt some time in a cove covered with rocks, whose floor was of white sand. But the [[Gnomes]] from [[Dor Lómin]] began to sent him wood through the hidden river of [[Glorfalc]], so Tuor could make a cottage himself.\n\nThe walls were embellished by Tuor with animals, birds, trees and flowers. His favourite carving was a swan, which eventually became the emblem of his [[House of the Swan|house]]. Tuor dwelt there for a while, until Ulmo appointed him with the mission to reach [[Gondolin]].<ref>{{LT2|III}}, pp. 151-2</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n''Falasqil'' is [[Qenya]], meaning \"Beach of Peace\".
