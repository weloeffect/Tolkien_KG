Here the path began in earnest, in a pitch-dark tunnel emanating fear. Within the tunnel could be heard a continuous whisper of voices in an unknown language. The wide road stretched on until it entered a great empty space. Within this cavern lay the skeleton of a [[Baldor|man]], richly garbed, with a golden helm. Before him were a stone door, shut fast where the man once attempted to enter; his notched, broken sword lay near and his bony hand still clutched at the cracks. The road continued past this point until finally the tinkle of water could be heard and led beside a rill of water through a broad high-arched gateway into a deep and narrow chasm between sheer cliffs. From this opening the path fell steeply down until it finally it issued sharp as a crack in a wall into the great [[Blackroot Vale]] where the river [[Morthond|Blackroot]] went down beside the path over many falls.<ref name=\"Grey\"/>\n\n==History==\nIn {{SA|3320}} the realm of Gondor was founded.<ref name=\"SA\">{{App|SA}}</ref> At that time [[Isildur]] set upon the crown of the hill of [[Erech]] a black stone and called upon the [[King of the Dead|King of the Mountains]] to swear allegiance to him, which he did.<ref name=\"Grey\"/> However, when [[Sauron]] attacked Gondor in {{SA|3429}}<ref name=\"SA\"/> and Isildur called upon the [[Oathbreakers|Men of the Mountains]] to honour their oath, they refused. Isildur then cursed them and their king, proclaiming that they would have no rest until the oath was fulfilled.<ref name=\"Grey\"/>\n \nThe Men of the Mountains fled before Isildur's wrath, hid in the mountains away from other men, and dwindled away. Thereafter their haunts, the hill of Erech and the Paths of the Dead, became places of terror to living men. After the migration of the Rohirrim from the vales of [[Anduin]] to Rohan the living no longer used the Paths of the Dead.<ref name=\"Grey\"/>\n \nIn {{TA|2569}} Prince [[Baldor]] of [[Rohan]], celebrating the completion of the great hall of [[Meduseld]], vowed to traverse the Paths of the Dead. He never returned and his father, King [[Brego]], died of grief a year later.<ref>{{App|Mark}}</ref> It is possible that Baldor was wounded by the last living remnants of the Men of the Mountains beyond the [[Dark Door]], because the door was shut in his face and \"enemies\" had followed him silently, caught up with him, broke his legs and left him to die in the darkness<ref>{{HM|RC}}, citing from a note by J.R.R. Tolkien to The Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor, p. 534</ref><ref>{{VT|42a}}, note 8, p. 22</ref><ref>{{NM|P3xxii}}, footnote 8, p. 394</ref> and Baldor and his father [[Brego]] had previously encountered an old man before the Dark Door who told them that the way was shut, that the old man died in that hour and that the Rohirrim had not received any other news of the ancient dwellers in the mountains.<ref>{{RK|Muster}}, p. 797</ref>\n\nIn the days of [[Arvedui]], the last king of [[Arthedain]], there lived [[Malbeth]] the Seer who foretold the following:\n \n<poem style=\"font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;\">\nOver the land there lies a long shadow,\nwestward reaching wings of darkness.\nThe Tower trembles; to the tombs of kings\ndoom approaches.  The Dead awaken;\nfor the hour is come for the oathbreakers:\nat the Stone of Erech they shall stand again\nand hear there a horn in the hills ringing.\nWhose shall the horn be?  Who shall call them\nfrom the grey twilight, the forgotten people?\nThe heir of him to whom the oath they swore.\nFrom the North shall he come, need shall drive him:\nhe shall pass the Door to the Paths of the Dead.<ref name=\"Grey\"/>\n</poem>\n \nOn [[8 March]] {{TA|3019|n}}, [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], [[Gimli]] and the [[Grey Company]] took the Paths of the Dead. A few days before Aragorn had told his two companions that he had used the [[Orthanc-stone]] and seen a grave threat to [[Gondor]] coming from the South. From [[Elrond]] Aragorn had received a reminder concerning the paths of the dead, and he related to them the prophecy of Malbeth.\n \nBefore the Door, only Aragorn's strength of will enabled his companions to overcome their fears and enter the Paths of the Dead. They found a skeleton in the central cavern, which they left behind as Aragorn summoned the Dead to follow him. Stumbling onward in the dark, Aragorn and the others emerged from the Paths above Erech, where they hurried to the Stone.\n \nAt the Stone of Erech, at midnight, Aragorn unfurled his banner, declared himself the heir of Isildur, and commanded the Dead to aid him.<ref name=\"Grey\"/> They obeyed and defeated the armies of the [[Corsairs of Umbar]] who were attacking the landings in southern Gondor. When those foes were defeated and Aragorn could claim the black ships of the Corsairs for his own, he declared that the curse was lifted and the dead departed forever.<ref>{{RK|Debate}}</ref>\n\n==Other Names==\nThe Paths of the Dead are called ''Fui ’Ngorthrim''<ref>{{HM|UI}}, p. 526</ref> in [[Sindarin]]. The meaning of the name ''Fui ’Ngorthrim'' is not glossed, but Paul Strack suggests that it means \"Paths of the Dead\" and that the initial element ''fui'' is the plural of an otherwise unattested noun ''fû'' (\"path\") and that the second element is the [[lenition|lenited]] class-plural of ''gorth'' (\"dead (person)\").<ref name=Eldamo>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-4204761609.html|articlename=S.
