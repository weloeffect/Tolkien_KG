Their [[Sindarin]] names are the ones usually given.\n\n==History==\nAfter the [[Darkening of Valinor]], [[Fëanor]] and his sons swore the terrible Oath of Fëanor, vowing to retrieve the [[Silmarils]] from anyone that would withhold them. The Sons of Fëanor followed their father [[Flight of the Noldor|out of Valinor]] and into [[Middle-earth]] along with their following of [[Noldor]].<ref name=Flight /> They took part in the Dagor-nuin-Giliath, in which Fëanor was mortally wounded. Soon after, Maedhros was captured by [[Morgoth]]. Following his rescue by [[Fingon]], Maedhros waived his claim to kingship over the Noldor, and it passed to the [[House of Fingolfin]]. Thereafter the [[House of Fëanor]] was called the Dispossessed, as [[Mandos]] had [[Doom of Mandos|predicted]].<ref name=Return />\n\nThe Sons of Fëanor and their followers settled in [[East Beleriand]] defending the open region which was named the [[March of Maedhros]]. Maedhros made his fortress upon [[Himring]], Celegorm and Curufin held the [[Pass of Aglon]], Maglor defended the [[Maglor's Gap|land]] between the northern arms of [[Gelion]], Caranthir and his folk moved to [[Thargelion]] which was thenceforth also called Dor Caranthir and Amrod and Amras dwelt in the woods south of the March.<ref>{{S|14}}</ref> Fëanor's sons were in general allied with the other [[Elves of Beleriand]] against the power of Morgoth and helped [[Siege of Angband|besiege]] [[Angband]] until the [[Dagor Bragollach]].\n\nAfter the recovery of one of the Great Jewels by [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] the Oath of their father came into action. Maedhros saw that Morgoth was indeed assailable, and set out to unite the peoples of Beleriand under the [[Union of Maedhros]]. Little aid came from [[Doriath]] and [[Nargothrond]] because of the earlier deeds of the Sons of Fëanor The Union was ended in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], leaving the Sons of Fëanor scattered and defeated.<ref>{{S|20}}</ref>\n\nThe Oath of Fëanor was roused once more when the Fëanorians learned that the Silmaril of Beren and Lúthien was now in the possession of their son [[Dior]]. They [[Second Kinslaying|attacked]] Dior in Doriath, and Celegorm, Curufin, and Caranthir were slain in the conflict, but they gained not the Silmaril, for Elwing escaped with it and fled to the [[Mouths of Sirion]].<ref>{{S|22}}</ref> After a time, tidings of Elwing's dwelling reached Maedhros, and, tormented by their Oath, he and his remaining brothers sent messages to the Havens requesting the Silmaril. But Elwing refused to surrender the Jewel, and the Sons of Fëanor [[Third Kinslaying|attacked]] her and the Elves of Sirion. Maedhros and Maglor had the victory, but both Amrod and Amras were slain. Elwing flung herself into the [[Great Sea|Sea]] with the Silmaril and brought it to [[Eärendil]], who bore it into the West. The sons of Eärendil and Elwing, [[Elros]] and [[Elrond]], were captured by the two brothers but Maglor grew to love them and fostered them.<ref name=Earendil>{{S|24}}</ref>\n\nAt the time of the [[War of Wrath]], only Maedhros and Maglor remained. They stole the last two Silmarils from the camp of [[Eönwë]], but their evil deeds in recovering them meant that the hallowed Jewels rejected their claimants, and their hands were burned. Maedhros in anguish threw himself into a fiery fissure, and Maglor in despair cast his Jewel into the [[Great Sea]].<ref name=Earendil />\n\n==The Sons==\n[[File:Lída Holubová - Feanor and his family.jpg|thumb|''Feanor and his family'' by [[:Category:Images by Lída Holubová|Lída Holubová]]]]\n#'''[[Maedhros]] the Tall''' - his [[father-name]] was ''Nelyafinwë'' (\"Finwë the Third\") and his [[Amilessë|mother-name]] was ''Maitimo'' (\"Well-shaped One\").

His mother gave him the name ''Umbarto'' (\"The Fated\"), but Fëanor changed it to ''Ambarto'' (\"Upwards-exalted\"), disturbed by the ominous name.\n\n==Birth and presentation order==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Source\n!Order\n!Specified?\n|-\n|''[[The Silmarillion]]'', pp.&nbsp;97, 131\n|Maedhros, Maglor, Celegorm, Caranthir, Curufin, Amrod, Amras\n|Amrod and Amras youngest and twins\n|-\n|''[[The Silmarillion]]'', Index of Names\n|Maedhros, Maglor, Celegorm, Caranthir, Curufin, Amrod, Amras\n|Specific birth order specified as listed\n|-\n|''[[The Book of Lost Tales: Part Two]]'', p.&nbsp;317\n|Maidros, Maglor, Dinithel, Damrod, Celegorm, Cranthor, Curufin \n|No\n|-\n|''[[Lays of Beleriand]]'', p.&nbsp;124\n|Curufin, Celegorm, Damrod, Díriel, Cranthir, Maglor, Maidros\n|Maidros as the eldest\n|-\n|''[[Lays of Beleriand]]'', p.&nbsp;191\n|Curufin, Celegorm, Damrod, Díriel, Cranthir, Maidros, Maglor\n|No\n|-\n|''[[The Shaping of Middle-earth]]'', p.&nbsp;13\n|Maidros, Maglor, Curufin, Celegorm, Cranthir, Damrod, Díriel\n|No\n|-\n|''[[The Shaping of Middle-earth]]'', p.&nbsp;17\n|Maidros, Maglor, Celegorm, Curufin, Damrod, Díriel, Cranthir\n|Maidros as the eldest\n|-\n|''[[The Shaping of Middle-earth]]'', p.&nbsp;54\n|Maidros, Maglor, Celegorm, Curufin, Cranthir, Damrod, Díriel\n|Damrod and Díriel as last\n|-\n|''[[The Lost Road]]'', p.&nbsp;102\n|Maidros, Maglor, Celegorm, Curufin, Cranthir, Damrod, Díriel\n|No\n|-\n|''[[The Lost Road]]'', p.&nbsp;177\n|Maidros, Maglor, Celegorn, Cranthir, Curufin, Damrod, Díriel,\n|Damrod and Díriel are twins and the youngest\n|-\n|''[[Morgoth's Ring]]'', p.&nbsp;159\n|Maidros, Maglor, Celegorn, Curufin, Cranthir, Damrod, Díriel\n|No\n|-\n|''[[Morgoth's Ring]]'', p.&nbsp;244\n|Maidros, Maglor, Celegorn, Cranthir, Curufin, Damrod, Díriel\n|Damrod and Díriel are the youngest\n|-\n|''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', p.&nbsp;435\n|Maedros, Maglor, Celegorm, Curufin, Caranthir, Amrod, Amras\n|Curufin specified as being the fourth son (p.&nbsp;442)\nAmrod and Amras as youngest and twins\n|}\n\n==See also ==\n*[[:Category:Images of the Sons of Fëanor|Images of the Sons of Fëanor]]\n\n{{references}}\n[[Category:Sons of Fëanor]]\n[[de:Söhne Feanors]]\n[[fi:Fëanorin pojat]]"}}}
