It is mentioned that the Gondorian troops abandoned Durthang after the plague and that it was afterwards occupied by the immortal demonic werewolf Gaurhir and a garrison of orcs. The castle of Durthang consists of five interconnected towers with its spire surpassing a height of 200 feet. Durthang consists of a ground floor, three levels and caverns below the ground floor.\n\n:In the [[Gorgoroth (book)|Gorgoroth]] campaign module it is described that Sauron called the Ringwraith Hoarmurath of Dír to Mordor in {{TA|1640}} and that he met with seven of the other Ringwraiths except the Witch-king at the castle of Ostigurth and then occupied the abandoned castle Durthang and resided there until {{TA|2000}} when he joined the other Ringwraiths in the siege of Minas Ithil. After the Ringwraiths conquered Minas Ithil in {{TA|2002}} the Ringwraith Hoarmurath of Dír took Minas Morgul as his permanent residence. From {{TA|2000}} on the demonic werewolf Gaurhir took command of Durthang and remained there as Hoarmurath's servant. It is mentioned that the basic garrison of Durthang consists of 36 Uruk-hai and 90 orcs.\n\n:In the ''[[Teeth of Mordor (book)|Teeth of Mordor]]'' module in the ''Fortresses of Middle-earth'' series it is described that [[Isildur]] began a grand plan to seal off Mordor and that the construction of Durthang began before the end of {{TA|1}} and was completed during the reign of [[Anardil (King of Gondor)|Anardil]] ({{TA|324}} - {{TA|411}}). It is mentioned that by {{TA|1640}} the last citadel guarding Mordor was abandoned. It is said that in the same year of the closing of the Dúnadan fortresses guarding Mordor Sauron sent all [[Ringwraiths]] except the [[Witch-king]] and [[Khamûl]] to lake [[Núrnen]] with the mission to ready Mordor for his return. It is described that they sent scouts north who found that the Gondorian fortresses were abandoned and that the Ringwraith Hoarmurath of Dír occupied Durthang. It is further said that Gondor concerned with internal matters scarcely noted the activity.\n[[File:Shadow of Mordor - Durthang.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Durthang - ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]'']]\n'''2014: ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]'':'''\n:Durthang is one of the strongholds in Udûn, which is the starting location of the game.\n\n'''2017: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''\n[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Durthang.jpg|thumb|250px|Durthang in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]\n:Durthang was added, along with a number of landmarks in [[Mordor]], in the game's [[The Lord of the Rings Online: Mordor|sixth major expansion]].\n\n:It was originally called \"Durthand\", and was the stronghold of an order known as the \"Thandrim\". During the reign of [[Eärnil II]], Durthand was cut off from support from Gondor, leaving many Thandrim to starve. In a year, the sixty survivors surrendered to \"Ugrukhôr\", one of Sauron's chief lieutenants, in exchange for safe passage through the Black Gate. Ugrukhôr let the Thandrim leave Mordor, only to have archers slay them all as soon as they passed the Black Gate, save one he spared to report these events to Gondor: \"Halannon the Survivor\".\n\n:Shortly after Sauron's fall, Durthang is still occupied by Orcs and [[Black Númenóreans|Black Númenórean]] servants of Ugrukhôr.\n\n{{References|n}}\n[[Category:Buildings]]\n[[Category:Fortresses]]\n[[Category:Mordor]]\n[[Category:Noldorin locations]]\n[[Category:Sindarin locations]]\n[[de:Durthang]]\n[[fr:encyclo:geographie:villes tours et forteresses:mordor:durthang]]\n[[fi:Durthang]]"}}}
