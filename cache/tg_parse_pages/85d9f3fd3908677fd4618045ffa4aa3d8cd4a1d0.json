Afterwards, the mistrals of Elves and Men made laments as a great gray stone was set upon the mound. In the [[Angerthas Daeron|Runes of Doriath]], the Elves engraved the words: ''TÚRIN TURAMBAR DAGNIR GLAURUNGA'' with the words ''NIËNOR NÍNIEL'' beneath it.<ref>{{CH|18}}</ref>\n\nIn the days after, [[Men]] became afraid to dwell there long. Sometime later, [[Morwen]] found the graven stone in her witless wanderings, read it and knew her children were dead, but did not understand how they died, and awaited death beside the stone.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, pp. 258, 259</ref>\n\nIn {{FA|501}}, [[Húrin]] was released from [[Angband]]. During his wanderings, he eventually came upon the Stone of the Hapless in time to meet Morwen one last time before she died in his arms. Believing that the [[Haladin]] knowingly let her starve, Húrin swore over Morwen's body to bring ruin upon the [[Forest of Brethil]].<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, pp. 273, 274</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Folkmoot for Judgement]] at the [[Moot-ring]], Húrin accused [[Harding]] of leaving Morwen to starve to death beside the Standing Stone, initiating a riot that brought about Húrin's objective.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, pp. 290, 291</ref>\n\nAfterwards, Húrin led the survivors back to the Standing Stone, where they helped him bury Morwen and carve into the stone the words: \"''Here lies also Morwen Eðelhwen''\". Afterwards, they sang laments while a gray rain came down. In the days following, the land around the Standing Stone remained leafless and bare, yet fear no longer kept [[Men]] from wandering to the Talbor as until the end of [[Beleriand]], the [[Men|women]] of [[Brethil]] would come to the stone, bringing flowers in spring and berries in autumn, singing of the [[Morwen|Grey Lady]] who sought her [[Túrin|son]]. During that time, a seer and harp-player by the name of [[Glirhuin]], made a song that Morgoth would never defile the Standing Stone and that it would remain standing ever after. Later, during the drowning of [[Beleriand]] \"in the [[War of Wrath|days of the wrath]] of the [[Valar]]\", the site of the Stone of the Hapless did not drown, but remained atop an island, [[Tol Morwen]].<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, p. 296</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe Stone of the Hapless was also known as the '''Talbor''' ([[Halethian|H.]] \"Standing Stone\"), a [[Halethian]] name comprised of the word ''[[bor (Taliska)|bor]]'' (\"Stone\") and some unknown element.<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, pp. 257, 309. See also note 15</ref>\n\n==Other versions of the legendarium==\nDuring the [[Dagor Dagorath]], when [[Túrin]] rises from the dead, it is unknown what would happen to the Stone of the Hapless whether it would survive or whether it would be destroyed or removed as collateral damage due to it being placed directly above Túrin's corpse.\n\n{{references}}\n\n[[Category:Graves and tombs]]\n\n[[de:Stein der Unglücklichen]]\n[[fi:Kovaonnisten Kivi]]\n[[fr:encyclo/geographie/tombes/pierre des infortunes]]"}}}
