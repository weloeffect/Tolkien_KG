He was seldom recorded as reading anything to the Club, and it was then not reported; but he appears to have written several novels.<ref name=\"Foreword\">{{SD|2b}}</ref>\n\nIn one of the meetings, after [[Michael George Ramer]] had finished reading his story, Guildford criticized it for not having a convincing method of transportation across the space, deeming it highly unlikely or even impossible for humans to ever (in flesh) get to another planet.<ref>{{SD|2c}}, \"Night 60\"</ref>\n\nWhen [[Alwin Arundel Lowdham]] and [[Wilfrid Trewin Jeremy]] went on a journey after the ''Night 67'', during which a [[wikipedia:Great Storm of 1987|great storm]] hit [[wikipedia:England|England]], and in which Lowdham and Jeremy seemed to have received a vision of a sort of the [[Downfall of Númenor]],<ref>{{SD|2d}}, \"Night 67\"</ref> he was the one who received a letter from the two, stating they were still \"researching\" and that \"more stuff may come through\".<ref>{{SD|2d}}, \"Night 68\"</ref>\n\n== Inspiration ==\nIt had been shown to the editor of the [[Notion Club Papers]], Mr. [[Howard Green]], by a historian [[J.R. Titmass]], that the name of ''Nicholas Guildford'' was derived from an old medieval text titled ''[[wikipedia:The Owl and the Nightingale|The Owl and the Nightingale]]'' and that it was a pseudonym.<ref name=\"Foreword\"/>\n\n{{references}}\n{{notionclub}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Guildford, Nicholas}}\n[[Category:Characters from the later Ages]]\n[[Category:Chroniclers of Arda]]\n[[Category:English people (in-universe)]]\n[[Category:The Notion Club Papers]]"}}}
