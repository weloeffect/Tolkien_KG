Some were relatively large and complex, while others were quite basic in nature. One thing that all Ent-houses had in common was a source of fresh water, from which the Ents made the [[Ent-draughts]] that were their only sustenance.\n\n[[Treebeard]] maintained several Ent-houses in [[Fangorn Forest]], with the one at [[Wellinghall]] including a tree-lined courtyard, furnishings of different kinds, and a rocky bay with a curtain of falling water. \n\nOther Ent-houses were rather less ornate: that of [[Quickbeam]], for example, consisted of nothing more than a flat stone surrounded by rowan-trees.<ref>{{TT|III4}}</ref>\n\n{{References}}\n[[Category:Buildings]]\n[[fi:Ent'asumus]]"}}}
