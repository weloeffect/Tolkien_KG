Men of the West!|[[Aragorn]]}}\n'''The Black Gate Opens''' is the fiftieth scene of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' and the sixty-fifth scene of [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (extended edition)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' (extended edition)]].\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe [[Captains of the West]] ride back from the [[Black Gate]] towards their soldiers after their encounter with the [[Mouth of Sauron]]. [[Aragorn]] rallies the army of [[Men]] with a speech and readies them for the seemingly hopeless battle which is imminent. He recognises their fear but bids them fight for all they hold dear in the world.\n\nAs the armies of [[Mordor]] encircle the forces of the West, [[Gandalf]] looks uncertain. ''\"Never thought I'd die fighting side by side with an elf\"'', [[Gimli]] says to [[Legolas]]. ''\"What about side by side with a friend?\"'' Legolas says quietly, smiling. Touched, Gimli says he could do that. \n\n\n[[Sam]] recognises that the gaze of [[Sauron]] has been drawn away and helps [[Frodo]] up. They make it to the slopes of [[Orodruin]] drained of energy. Frodo, unable to stand, gazes upwards and sees the fires coming out of Mount Doom. He crawls a short way but collapses in utter exhaustion. \n\n==Differences==\nAragorn's speech is not present in the books. After the encounter with the [[Mouth of Sauron]], Aragorn and Gandalf take command from a hill. When the battle begins, it is told from Pippin's point of view. He accepts that he will die, and makes the comment that he understands Denethor better now.<ref>{{RK|Gate}}, pp. 891-3</ref> \n{{title}}\n{{references}}\n[[Category:The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King scenes|65]]"}}}
