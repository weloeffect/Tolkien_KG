'''Baranor''' was a man of [[Gondor]] in the [[Third Age]]. 

==History==
Baranor came from a line of [[Gondorians]] of [[Ithilien]] who then moved to the vales of the [[White Mountains]], most likely in [[Lossarnach]]. 

He had a son, [[Beregond]], a hero of the [[siege of Minas Tirith]], and seems to have also dwelt in that city.

==Etymology==
Baranor was likely named after [[Baranor (son of Baran)|the first name Man of the same name]]. It could mean various things:
* ''[[Bara]]'' + ''[[naur]]'', "Fierce Fire"
* ''[[Baran]]'' + ''[[Or]]'', "Ruddy mountain"
* ''[[Bar]]'' + ''[[Sun|Anor]]'', "House of the Sun"
