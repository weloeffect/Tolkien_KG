'''Marcho''' and '''Blanco''' were brothers,  [[Bree-hobbits]] of [[Fallohides|Fallohide]] stock who founded [[the Shire]] in [[Third Age 1601]].<ref name="hobbits">{{FR|Hobbits}}, p. 4</ref><ref name="family">{{App|Baggins}}, p. 1099</ref>

==History==
In {{TA|1601}}, the two brothers led a group of mostly [[Harfoots|Harfoot]] [[hobbits]] westwards from [[Bree]].<ref name="family" /> They crossed the river [[Baranduin]] at the [[Brandywine Bridge|Bridge of Stonebows]], and with the permission of [[King of Arthedain|King]] [[Argeleb II]] they settled in the royal hunting grounds of [[Arthedain]] and founded [[the Shire]]. 

Soon after (c. {{TA|1630}}) they are joined by [[Stoors]], who come up from [[Dunland]] and settle in the Shire.<ref>{{App|TA}}, p. 1086</ref>

==Etymology==
Marcho contains the [[Old English]] element ''*marh'' ("horse") and Blanco is derived from Old English ''blanca'' ("white horse", "grey horse").<ref name="Shippey">[[Tom Shippey]], [[The Road to Middle-earth]], Chapter 4 A Cartographic Plot, '''''Maps and Names''''', p. 116</ref><ref name="Marmor">{{HM|IE}}, "An etymological excursion among the Shire Folk", p. 181</ref>

==Inspiration==
The two brothers are perhaps based on [[Wikipedia:Hengest|Hengest]] and [[Wikipedia:Horsa|Horsa]], who brought the Angles, Saxons and Jutes to England. It is noteworthy that both ''hengest''<ref name=BT1>{{webcite|website=[http://www.bosworthtoller.com/ Bosworth-Toller Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]|articleurl=https://bosworthtoller.com/18697|articlename=hengest|accessed=18 April 2025}}</ref> and ''horsa'' mean "stallion" and "horse", respectively, in [[Old English]].<ref name="Shippey"/><ref name="Marmor"/>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In an earlier typescript version of the Prologue<ref>{{PM|Prologue}}, typescript P 2 footnote relating to "about the year 1050 in Shire-reckoning"</ref> and in an earlier manuscript version of the family tree of the Baggins family<ref>{{PM|Trees}}, manuscript BA 3</ref> the two Hobbit brothers whe founded the Shire were called Marco and Cavallo.
