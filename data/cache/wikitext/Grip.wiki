'''Grip''' was a large wolf-like [[Dogs|dog]], one of three kept by [[Farmer Maggot]] on his farm at [[Bamfurlong]] in the [[Marish]]. Like Maggot's other dogs, [[Fang (dog)|Fang]] and [[Wolf (dog)|Wolf]], Grip was ferocious by nature. 

Grip was with Maggot when a stranger in the form of a [[Black Rider]] came to the farm searching for '[[Baggins Family|Baggins]]', and at that time his obedience and ferocity failed: he sniffed the stranger, then yelped in terror and ran from him howling, sensing the [[Black Shadow]].<ref>{{FR|I4}}</ref>
