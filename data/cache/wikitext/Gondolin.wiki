'''Gondolin''' was a city in [[Beleriand]] founded by [[Turgon]] which became the home of his people for most of the late [[First Age]].

Some years after the [[Exile of the Noldor]], Turgon was guided by [[Ulmo]] to the hidden valley of [[Tumladen]], and there he founded Gondolin. Turgon's people, who had previously dwelt in [[Nevrast]], travelled there secretly, becoming the '''[[Gondolindrim]]'''. Also known as the '''Hidden City''', it was concealed from friend and foe alike by the [[Echoriad|Encircling Mountains]], and guarded against trespassers by the [[Eagles]] of [[Thorondor]].

The city remained hidden for nearly four hundred years, becoming the last Elven realm to endure against [[Morgoth]], before it was finally discovered through the treachery of [[Maeglin]] and besieged. Turgon was lost in the [[Fall of Gondolin|Fall]] of the city, but some few escaped the destruction and dwelt as [[Exiles of Gondolin|Exiles]] at the [[Mouths of Sirion]].

==History==
===Building===
[[File:Mysilvergreen - Turgon and Finrod on the bank of Sirion.jpg|left|thumb|''Turgon and Finrod on the bank of Sirion'' by [[:Category:Images by Mysilvergreen|Mysilvergreen]]]]

The round valley of [[Tumladen]], within the [[Encircling Mountains]], had originally been a lake, and in its centre stood a hill that had once been an island: [[Amon Gwareth]].<ref name=Noldor>{{S|15}}</ref> The valley had been emptied a long time before through the [[Dry River]], creating the only entrance to the valley: the secret path of [[Orfalch Echor]].<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}, pp. 44-46</ref>

In {{FA|50}},<ref>{{GA|74}}</ref> Turgon left [[Nevrast]] and travelled with his cousin [[Finrod]] southward through Beleriand. While they were resting in the [[Meres of Twilight]], [[Ulmo]] came to them and laid upon them a deep sleep and disturbing dreams. Neither told the other about his dreams, but both cousins began a search for hidden places in case [[Morgoth]] broke the [[Siege of Angband]]. Soon, Finrod found the place where he would build his realm: [[Nargothrond]]; but Turgon did not, so he came back to Nevrast. [[First Age 53|Three years later]],<ref>{{GA|76}}</ref> the Lord of Waters appeared to Turgon upon the shores and commanded him to travel forth alone. Guided by the Vala, Turgon found the valley of Tumladen and decided to found his city upon Amon Gwareth, as a memorial to [[Tirion]] upon [[Túna]]. However, he came first back to Nevrast, where he planned the building of his city.<ref>{{S|13}}</ref>

After the [[Dagor Aglareb]], in {{FA|64}},<ref>{{GA|89}}</ref> Turgon felt unquiet again, and taking the most skilled of his people he went in secret to the hidden vale, and the first building of the city was begun. A watch was set around it, but the power of Ulmo also protected them. During the next fifty-two years, Turgon dwelt mostly in Nevrast, until the city was completed. Then he gave his city the name ''Ondolindë'' in [[Quenya]], the "Rock of the Music of Water", because of the fountains of [[Amon Gwareth]]. In [[Sindarin]] this was rendered ''Gondolin'', the "Hidden Rock".<ref name=Noldor>{{S|15}}</ref> In {{FA|116}},<ref>{{GA|112}}</ref> before leaving [[Vinyamar]], Ulmo appeared to Turgon once more and told him:
[[File:Marya Filatova - Turgon.jpg|thumb|''Turgon'' by [[Marya Filatova]]]]
{{blockquote|Now thou shalt go at last to Gondolin, Turgon; and I will maintain my power in the Vale of Sirion, and in all the waters therein, so that none shall mark thy going, nor shall any find there the hidden entrance against thy will. Longest of all the realms of the Eldalië shall Gondolin stand against Melkor. [...] Thus it may come to pass that the [[Doom of Mandos|curse of the Noldor]] shall find thee too ere the end, and treason awake within thy walls. Then they shall be in peril of fire. But if this peril draweth nigh indeed, then even from Nevrast one shall come to warn thee...}}

The people of Turgon were a third part of Fingolfin's followers and native Sindar of Nevrast, and they travelled from Nevrast and secretly entered the valley of Tumladen in discreet companies. After their arrival in the new city, the [[Gondolindrim]] continued to labour in its building, until it was said to rival even Tirion itself. Its walls stood high and shone white above the plain, and its most prominent feature was the great [[Tower of the King]], where, among the fountains, Turgon himself made [[Glingal and Belthil]], trees of gold and silver, in memory of the [[Two Trees of Valinor]].<ref name=Noldor>{{S|15}}</ref>

===Coming of Maeglin ===
[[File:Sara M. Morello - Half Noldor.jpg|thumb|''Half Noldo'' by [[:Category:Images by Sara M. Morello|Sara M. Morello]]]]
There followed the two centuries of the [[Long Peace]]: Morgoth was [[Siege of Angband|besieged]] in the far north of the world, and the people of Gondolin lived undisturbed by the events outside their valley. However, a seed of discontent appeared: in {{FA|316}},<ref>{{GA|118}}</ref> Turgon's sister [[Aredhel]] became tired of her limited life in the valley and was determined to leave the city, much against Turgon's wishes, and journey into [[Beleriand]]. However, she was lost outside and Gondolin fell into sorrow for many years.<ref name=Maeglin>{{S|Maeglin}}</ref>

More than eighty years later, in {{FA|400}},<ref>{{GA|120}}</ref> suddenly Aredhel returned with [[Maeglin]], her son by [[Eöl]] the [[Dark Elf]]. Maeglin was enamoured of the city and Turgon welcomed him. But Eöl had followed his wife and son to Gondolin and was captured at the entranceway. He was brought before Turgon, and it was explained to him that the law of Gondolin did not allow any visitor to leave. Eöl refused to submit to Turgon's authority and instead chose death for himself and his unwilling son. He threw a poisoned dart to slay Maeglin, but it instead struck Aredhel, who fell ill with the poison and died. The body of Eöl was thrown off the [[Caragdûr]] for this offense.

Maeglin, however, had taken no part in these evils, and Turgon accepted him into the city. With time Maeglin grew to be among the lords of the Gondolindrim. "Thus it was in Gondolin; and amid all the bliss of that realm, while its glory lasted, a dark seed of evil was sown".<ref name=Maeglin>{{S|Maeglin}}</ref>

=== Two great battles ===
[[File:Alan Lee - Húrin and Huor are Carried to Gondolin.jpg|thumb|''Húrin and Huor are Carried to Gondolin'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]
When Morgoth broke the [[Siege of Angband]] in the [[Dagor Bragollach]], the people of Gondolin did not take part in any of its conflicts. However, in {{FA|458}},<ref>{{GA|161}}</ref> they were drawn into the events of those years, when two young brothers of the race of [[Men]], [[Húrin]] and [[Huor]], were cut off from their army and became lost amid the feet of the [[Crissaegrim]]. Thorondor brought them to Turgon's city. At the bidding of Ulmo, Turgon accepted them, and they remained in Gondolin for almost a year. Although the law of Gondolin did not allow any visitor to leave, Turgon made an exception and allowed them to return to their homes. Both brothers kept the promise of not telling anyone where they had been, but other Men could deduce it, and soon a rumour was spread that reached Morgoth's servants.<ref name=Fingolfin>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

Some years later, [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] were saved by the Eagles, and flying south, Lúthien could see far below, as a white light starting from a green jewel, the radiance of Gondolin the fair. But Lúthien wept because her beloved was mortally wounded.<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref>

{{blockquote|But it is said in song that her tears falling from on high as she passed came like silver raindrops on the plain, and there a fountain sprang to life: the Fountain of Tinúviel, [[Eithel Nínui]], most healing water until it withered in the flame.<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, p. 301</ref>}}

===Encirclement===
As the Elves of [[Beleriand]] began to prepare for a counterstrike to the Dagor Bragollach, Turgon secretly began his own preparations and sent some forces to the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], where they were helped by the [[House of Hador]]. The only survivor thereof was Húrin, who was captured. Morgoth had great fear of Turgon, who was now [[High King of the Noldor]], and wished to destroy him more than any other enemy.<ref name=Nirnaeth>{{S|Nirnaeth}}</ref> Therefore, the Dark Lord tortured Húrin and offered him freedom, but he could not make him reveal the location of Gondolin.<ref>{{CH|3}}</ref>

[[File:Ted Nasmith - Tuor Reaches the Hidden City of Gondolin.jpg|left|thumb|''Tuor reaches the Hidden City of Gondolin'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
After returning from the Nirnaeth, Maeglin built the [[Gate of Steel]], the last of the [[Seven Gates of Gondolin]].<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}, p. 49</ref>

In {{FA|495}},<ref>{{GA|299}}</ref> [[Ulmo]] appeared to [[Tuor]] and explained to him that the [[Curse of Mandos]] was coming to its fulfilment, but a chance still remained to avoid Doom upon Turgon and his people.<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}, p. 29</ref> Thus, Tuor was guided to the Hidden City by [[Voronwë]], one of the mariners sent by Turgon to the West, who had survived a shipwreck. [[Ulmo's warning]] was that Turgon must abandon the city and seek the sea. Turgon, because of his pride and his love for his city, decided to ignore this warning. Tuor, however, was welcomed in the city by all save Maeglin. In later years, Tuor and [[Idril]], the King's daughter, married and had a son: [[Eärendil]].<ref name=Fall>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>

Despite rejecting the warning, Turgon felt unrest, remembering the Doom of Mandos and fearing treason. So he ordered the [[Seven Gates of Gondolin|Gates]] of the Mountains to be closed and he forbade anyone to leave the city, be it for peace or war.<ref name=Fall>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>
[[File:Marya Filatova - Furry, feathered, hoofed - Thorondor.jpg|thumb|Thorondor and Turgon, art by [[Marya Filatova]]]]
The first great blow to the security of Gondolin came by accident. [[Húrin]], who had been held captive by Morgoth, was released to wander in the world. In {{FA|501}},<ref>{{WJ|Hurin}}, p. 254</ref> he came to the edge of the Encircling Mountains, hoping to find the secret way to Gondolin. But the [[Way of Escape]] was closed, the Dry River blocked and the doors buried. Thorondor himself informed Turgon of the presence of Húrin. The King saw it as a bad omen and, fearing what Morgoth might have done to Húrin, withheld rescue. On further consideration, Turgon changed his mind, but it was too late. Húrin, seeing nothing, cried out in a loud voice "''Turgon, Turgon, remember the [[Fen of Serech]]! O Turgon, will you not hear in your hidden halls?''". Thus Morgoth learned the general area in which Gondolin lay, for his spies were watching this. Húrin turned away, broken and bitter.<ref name=Doriath>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>

In {{FA|507}},<ref name=Years>{{WJ|Years}}, p. 351</ref> [[Doriath]] fell, and Gondolin became the last Elven realm enduring against the power of Morgoth. Thorondor informed Turgon of the falls of [[Nargothrond]] and Doriath, but Turgon did not act, and swore he would never fight on the side of the [[Sons of Fëanor]].<ref name=Fall>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>

===Fall===
{{main|Fall of Gondolin}}
In the years following Húrin's revealing of Gondolin's region, Morgoth increased his search in the lands between the river [[Sirion]] and [[Anach]]. However, his spies and creatures could not do much due to the protection of the Eagles. Meanwhile, in Gondolin there was peace, and none knew that the kingdom was encircled by the Enemy save Idril, who felt dark [[Foresight|forebodings]] in her heart. She ordered the construction of an [[Idril's secret way|escape tunnel]] that led to the plain in the northern part of the city. Only a few were informed of this way, and she asked that Maeglin hear nothing about it.<ref name=Fall>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>

In {{FA|509}},<ref name=Years>{{WJ|Years}}, p. 351</ref> Maeglin, disobeying Turgon's laws, strayed too far from the city while searching for ore. There he was captured by [[Orcs]] and taken to [[Angband]]. Daunted by tortures, Maeglin bought his life in exchange for betraying Gondolin, motivated also by his hatred for Tuor and the desire for Idril. Therefore he gave Morgoth the exact location of the city, and the ways by which it could be reached and attacked. Morgoth felt very pleased, and promised to give him the hand of Idril, and make him lord of Gondolin under his vassalage; this was considered the worst treason of the [[Elder Days]]. Maeglin was released to avoid suspicion and to make an inside attack when the moment came.<ref name=Fall>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>

[[File:Ted Nasmith - Flight of the Doomed.jpg|thumb|''Flight of the Doomed'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
The next year,<ref name=Years /> when Eärendil was seven years old, Morgoth was prepared and sent a massive army, composed of [[Balrogs]], [[Orcs]], [[Wolves]] and [[Dragons]]. They crossed the northern part of the [[Echoriath]], where the mountains were higher and therefore less guarded. In the city, the Gondolindrim were preparing for the [[Gates of Summer]], a festival in which they welcomed the sunrise. But instead of seeing the light from the east, a red light appeared in the north. Nothing stopped the enemy until it reached the walls of the city, and the siege began.

There was a great siege, during which the captains of the [[Twelve houses of the Gondothlim|noble houses]] and their warriors fell. The [[Tower of the King]] was defended, but it fell with great ruin and King Turgon died there. Meanwhile, attacking from the inside, Maeglin captured Idril and Eärendil, taking them to the walls. Tuor arrived in time to save them both, and after fighting Maeglin, threw him from the walls down into the flames.

Gathering as many of the people as they could find, Tuor and Idril escaped down their tunnel and led the [[Exiles of Gondolin]] at the [[Mouths of Sirion]], where they mourned the loss of the White City.<ref name=Fall/>

==Legacy==
[[File:Anke Eißmann - Elrond.jpg|thumb|''Elrond'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]
Ages later, some legendary weapons of Gondolin were found by [[Thorin and Company]] in a [[Trolls' lair]]. [[Elrond]] recognized them and explained that they ended up there after being plundered by dragons or goblins.<ref>{{H|3}}</ref> Even in the [[Third Age]], some [[orcs of the Misty Mountains]] knew of the legendary sword of Turgon, remembering how the Elves of Gondolin killed hundreds of goblins before their walls.<ref name="overhill">{{H|4}}</ref>

The realm would be mentioned by [[Elrond]] during his [[Council of Elrond|Council]],<ref>{{FR|II2}}, p. 243, "...Eärendil was my sire, who was born in Gondolin before its fall..."</ref> and remembered by [[Galadriel]],<ref>{{FR|II7}}, p. 357, "...for ere the fall of Nargothrond or Gondolin I passed over the mountains..."</ref> and also sung in Dwarven lore.<ref>{{FR|II4}}, p. 316, "[[The world was young, the mountains green,]]"</ref>

==Etymology==
''Gondolin'' means "Hidden Rock" in [[Sindarin]], from ''[[gond]]'' ("rock") + ''dolen'' ("hidden").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entry ''[[gond]]''</ref> It was a name that evolved from the original [[Quenya]] ''Ondolindë''.<ref name=Noldor>{{S|15}}</ref> However, [[Tolkien]] speculated that ''Gondolin'' was actually a hybrid between [[North Sindarin]] and Quenya.<ref name=Ondolin>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 29</ref>

The name remained the same since early versions of the [[legendarium]], but its meaning has evolved with the [[Elvish]] languages. In the first [[Gnomish]] concept, ''Gondolin'' meant "Stone of Song", from ''gonn'' ("great stone, rock") + ''dólin'' ("song").<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry ''Gondolin''</ref> In the [[Noldorin]] phase, it meant "Heart of Hidden Rock", from ''gonn'' ("rock") + ''doll'' ("dark, hidden, secret") + ''ind'' ("inner thought, heart").<ref name=Etymologies>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries "GOND", "DUL"</ref>

==Other names==
{{seealso|#The Seven Names}}
'''''Ondolindë''''' is Quenya for "Rock of the Music of Water",<ref>{{WJ|Turgon}}, p. 201</ref> literally "Singing Stone" or "Stone of Music". A short form was '''''Ondolin'''''.<ref name=Ondolin>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 29</ref> Tolkien speculated that the proper [[Sindarized]] form for ''Ondolin(dë)'' would be '''''Gon'''''('''''g''''')'''''lin''''',<ref name=Eldarin>{{PE|Eldarin}} p. 133</ref> with the archaic variation '''''Goen'''('''g''')'''lin'''''.<ref name=Ondolin />

Other earlier names in [[Noldorin]] were '''''Gondost''''' ("City of Stone"), '''''Gondobar''''' ("Stone of the World") and '''''Gondothrimbar'''''.<ref name=Etymologies />

In [[Eriol]]'s [[Old English]] translations, Gondolin is referred as ''Stangaldor(burg)'' ("stone-enchantment-city"), ''Folgenburg'' ("hidden city"), ''Galdorfaesten'' ("enchantment-fortress").<ref>{{SM|QA1}}, p. 210</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
===The Book of Lost Tales===
====History====
The first tale of the [[legendarium]] written by [[Tolkien]] was "[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]" in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. No other version would tell with such detail the description of Gondolin, its lords and its fall, and the history differs much from the one presented above, especially in the foundation and aftermath.
[[File:John Howe - Morgoth's Force before Gondolin.jpg|thumb|''Morgoth's force before Gondolin'' by [[John Howe]]]]
Before [[Turgon]] was born, the prophet [[Amnon]] prophesied the [[fall of Gondolin]] and the fate of Turgon.<ref>{{LT1|VII}}, pp. 167, 172</ref> Turgon was born soon after the [[Exile of the Noldor|Flight of the Noldoli]] and later he participated in the [[Battle of Unnumbered Tears]]. He could run out of the battle and save the women and children of the camps. Then he fled south along Sirion, and aided by its magic waters, he escaped into a secret place away from [[Melko]]. There the [[Noldoli]] built the secret city of Gondolin and Turgon became their king.<ref>{{LT1|X}}, pp. 238-42</ref> The people of Gondolin became known as '''[[Gondothlim]]''', the dwellers in stone.<ref name=Tale>{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|155}} They worked for many years building Gondolin, and there was made a secret entry among the mountains, the [[Way of Escape]], that was kept open and guarded for the Noldoli escaping from enthrallment by Melko. When the city was finished, the folk became busy making weapons, armour and arrows in case they were attacked. All the encircling mountains had a constant guard, but this was not necessary, as the plain of [[Tumladin]] was smooth and everything could be seen from [[Amon Gwareth]].<ref name=Tale/>{{rp|163}}

While Melko expanded his armies through the [[Great Lands]], the [[Noldoli]] only could find refuge in the realms of [[Artanor]] and Gondolin.<ref>{{LT2|II}}, p. 77</ref> But when Beren and Tinúviel faded away after the first fall of Artanor, Gondolin became the last glorious kingdom and many Elves sought for it.<ref>{{LT2|IV}}, p. 241</ref> 

Eventually, by order of Ulmo, [[Tuor]] wandered looking for the City of Stone, and this was known to Melko, who increased his watchfulness. Tuor was helped by the [[Gnome]] [[Voronwë]], who found the secret entry, covered with enchantments that hid it from anyone without Gnomish blood.<ref name=Tale/>{{rp|156–7}} Once in Gondolin, Tuor was led to King Turgon and gave him [[Ulmo's warning]]: that the Gondothlim had to march to war against Melko or leave the city and dwell beside the sea. Turgon refused both, but invited Tuor to live in his city, and Tuor accepted, as it was a fair place.<ref name=Tale/>{{rp|161–2}}
[[File:Catherine Chmiel - Maeglin was taken prisoner by orcs.jpg|thumb|''Maeglin was taken prisoner by orcs'' by [[Catherine Karina Chmiel]]]]
Now Melko, wondering about the Man that had wandered alone, summoned a vast army of dark spies and sent them to look after the Noldoli that escaped years ago. They found the Way of Escape and could see the city in the distance, but the guard was strong and never approached there. Turgon was informed of this and felt unrest, so the guard was increased and preparations for war were made.<ref name=Tale/>{{rp|165–7}}

In those days, [[Meglin]], Turgon's nephew, was captured by Orcs while straying in the mountains alone. Before they knew that he was one of the Gondothlim, he offered knowledge about Gondolin in exchange for his life. Thus he was brought to Melko, and both devised a plan to conquer the city. Meglin gave Melko the description of Gondolin and the idea of building [[Iron Dragons]] that could cross the Encircling Mountains and the city walls. Then Meglin returned and Melko began building his war devices and gathering evil armies during seven years. Noticing that Melko's spies withdrew, the Gondothlim felt fearless and thought that Melko had desisted after seeing Gondolin's might. But Idril's concern increased and she warned some Gondothlim, but they laughed, believing that the city would stand forever like [[Taniquetil]].<ref name=Tale/>{{rp|168–71}}

For the feast of [[Tarnin Austa]], the Gates of Summer, the Gondothlim gathered in silence the night before and waited for the dawn. However, when that night came, a new red light was seen in the northern mountains and explorers came saying that Melko's armies were coming. All the [[twelve houses of the Gondothlim]] prepared for battle, and Turgon held a council with their lords. There Tuor asked to leave the city before the enemy came, so they could take women and children to a safe place, but Meglin reminded the king of how much wealth and work they had put into the city, and Turgon decided to face the siege.<ref name=Tale/>{{rp|172–5}}
[[File:Matěj Čadil - Gondolin in Ruins.jpg|thumb|''Gondolin in ruins'' by [[Matěj Čadil]]]]
:''For a detailed description of the [[Fall of Gondolin|siege]] see [[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)#The battle of Gondolin]].''

As prophesied, Gondolin and its king fell in ruin, but a group of [[Exiles of Gondolin|exiles]] escaped and took refuge in the [[mouth of Sirion]]. The fall of Gondolin would be esteemed as the worst deed of Melko and the most dread of sack upon Earth.<ref name=Tale />{{rp|196}} The Lost Tale of Eärendel is only given in dispersed notes, so of the aftermath there are different versions which can be summarized as follows: After the fall, the doves and pigeons of Turgon's courtyard travelled to [[Valinor]] and told the Gods and Elves about the fate of Gondolin. This would cause an uproar among the Eldar, who marched to the Great Lands in a [[War of Wrath|war]] against Melko. Unaware of this, [[Eärendel]] came during his travels back to Gondolin with [[Galdor (elf of Gondolin)|Galdor]]. In the ruins of the city they found Men camping there miserably and Gnomes searching for lost gems.<ref>{{LT2|V}}, pp. 253, 255, 257-8, 263</ref> 

====Description====
[[File:Quentandil - Gondolin Map.png|thumb|250px|A map of Gondolin based on [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]]'s ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'']]

The hills of [[Tumladin]] formed a great circle around the plain, and [[Amon Gwareth]], the Hill of Watch, was set therein, not directly in the middle, but nearer to the [[Way of Escape]]. Upon the hill rose the city of Gondolin, with its towers pricking the sky. The plain was so clear that anyone could walk there with no need of a guide. The many pathways from the mountains to the city took a daylight's march to traverse, and they were fair and levelled, crossing the sward covered here and there with smooth boulders or clean pools. Amon Gwareth could only be climbed by winding stairs, which led to the main gate. This gate was westwards and was of great weight and strength, made of iron, although it seemed golden in the light of the sunset.<ref name=Tale/>{{rp|158–60}} There was another entry gate in the north,<ref name=Tale/>{{rp|176}} but it is not said if there were more.

{{blockquote|Now the streets of Gondolin were paved with stone and wide, kerbed with marble, and fair houses and courts amid gardens of bright flowers were set about the ways, and many towers of great slenderness and beauty built of white marble and carved most marvellously rose to the heaven. Squares there were lit with fountains and the home of birds that sang amid the branches of their aged trees, but of all these the greatest was that place where stood the king's palace, and the [[Tower of the King|tower]] thereof was the loftiest in the city, and the fountains that played before the doors shot twenty fathoms and seven in the air and fell in a singing rain of crystal: therein did the sun glitter splendidly by day, and the moon most magically shimmered by night. The birds that dwelt there were of the whiteness of snow and their voices sweeter than a lullaby of music.<ref name=Tale/>{{rp|160}}}}

White stairs led to the doors of the palace, and on each side of these were the two trees called [[Glingal and Belthil|Glingol and Bansil]], one golden, the other silver. Neither ever faded, for they were shoots of the [[Two Trees of Valinor|Trees of Valinor]] before their destruction.<ref name=Tale/>{{rp|160–1}}

The northwest entry to the [[Square of the Palace]] was the [[Road of Arches]], which led to the [[Place of the Well]]. This could also be accessed by the [[Arch of Inwë]] in the west, and it was a place with many trees, oaks and poplars, that encircled a great well of vast depth with very pure water.<ref name=Tale/>{{rp|181–2}} Another entry to the Square of the Palace was the [[Alley of Roses]], which was a fair place to see and to walk in.<ref name=Tale/>{{rp|183}}

From the Square of the Palace, the [[Road of Pomps]] went southwards, leading to [[Gar Ainion]], the Place of the Gods, where weddings were celebrated in its Place of Wedding. It was very open and in its middle was the highest ground of the city, so from there the Place of the King could be seen below. Another street to the southern part of the city was the [[Way of Running Waters]], which led to the [[Fountains of the South]].<ref name=Tale/>{{rp|186}} Past these was the house of Tuor upon the southern walls, where flowed free air and the dawn light shone.<ref name=Tale/>{{rp|164}} The [[folk of the Fountain]] also dwelt in the southern part,<ref name=Tale/>{{rp|173}} as well as [[Salgant]], near the [[Lesser Market]]. East of the city was the [[Great Market]], full of stores and fair workmanships.<ref name=Tale/>{{rp|182}}

{{blockquote|Glory dwelt in that city of Gondolin of the Seven Names, and its ruin was the most dread of all the sacks of cities upon the face of Earth. Nor [[:Wikipedia:Babylon|Bablon]], nor [[:Wikipedia:Nineveh|Ninwi]], nor the towers of [[:Wikipedia:Troy|Trui]], nor all the many takings of [[:Wikipedia:Rome|Rûm]] that is greatest among Men, saw such terror as fell that day upon Amon Gwareth in the kindred of the Gnomes; and this is esteemed the worst work that Melko has yet thought of in the world.<ref name=Tale/>{{rp|196}}}}

====The Seven Names====
In later versions of the legendarium, Gondolin is still known as the ''City of Seven Names'',<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}, "Notes", note 31</ref> but only in the ''Lost Tales'' phase are these names given. "City of Seven Names" was ''Ostrin An Ost'' in [[Gnomish]], and ''Tirios Otsoyáma'' in [[Qenya]].<ref name=Names>{{PE|13}}, p. 102</ref> When Tuor sees the city for the first time, he asks about these names and a guard recites to him:

{{blockquote|Tis said and 'tis sung: ''''Gondobar''' am I called and '''Gondothlimbar''', City of Stone and City of the Dwellers in Stone; '''Gondolin''' the Stone of Song and '''Gwarestrin''' am I named, the Tower of Guard, '''Gar Thurion''' or the Secret Place, for I am hidden from the eyes of Melko; but they who love me most greatly call me '''Loth''', for like a flower am I, even '''Lothengriol''' the flower that blooms on the plain.'<ref name=Tale>{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|158}}}}

The [[Qenya]] cognate for ''Gondolin'' was '''''Ondolinda'''''.<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry "Gondolin"</ref> The cognates for the other names were:<ref name=Names />
* ''Gondobar'' ("Stone House"): '''''Ondomard-''''' or '''''Ondosta'''''.
* ''Gondothlimbar'' ("House of the Stone Folk"): '''''Ondostamard-'''''.
* ''Gwarestrin'' ("Tower of Guard"): '''''Tiri(o)stirion''''' or '''''Vara-, Vorastirin'''''.
* ''Gar Thurion'' ("Secret Place"): '''''Ardalomba''''' or '''''Ardaurin'''''.
* ''Loth'' ("Flower"): '''''Lossë''''' ("Rose").
* ''Lothengriol''<ref group=note>Earlier forms of the name ''Lothengriol'' were ''Losengriol'' and ''Lósengriol''. Cf. ''The Book of Lost Tales Part One'', p. 172; and  ''The Book of Lost Tales Part Two'', p. 202</ref> ("Flower of the Vale" or "Lily of the Valley"): '''''Endillos'''''

===Later versions===
[[Tolkien]] never fully developed the story of Gondolin in later versions of the legendarium, so while editing ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', [[Christopher Tolkien]] had to make choices about certain details, the main one being the discovery of Gondolin. As detailed [[#The Book of Lost Tales|above]], in ''The Book of Lost Tales'' it is told that Melko discovered Gondolin after hearing of a man (Tuor) wandering near Sirion and sending an army of spies which saw the hidden city in the distance. When Meglin is captured, he betrays the city by attacking from the inside during the siege and by giving Melko the idea of building the [[Iron Dragons]]. In the next phase of the story, the ''[[Quenta Noldorinwa]]'', it is Meglin who gives Morgoth the location of Gondolin when he is captured.<ref>{{SM|Q16}}, p. 143</ref>

However, in Tolkien's last revision, it is Húrin who accidentally gives the location of Gondolin to Morgoth, when he called to Turgon in the [[Echoriad]]. Here it is said that "Morgoth smiled, and knew now clearly in what region Turgon dwelt".<ref>{{WJ|I}}, pp. 272-273</ref> Tolkien then recovered the idea of Maeglin's betrayal as it was in the first version, as said in some notes:

{{blockquote|Later when captured and Maeglin wished to buy his release with treachery, Morgoth must answer laughing, saying: Stale news will buy nothing. I know this already, I am not easily blinded! So Maeglin was obliged to offer more – to undermine resistance in Gondolin [...] and to compass the death of Tuor and Eärendel if he could. If he did he would be allowed to retain Idril (said Morgoth).<ref name=Notes>{{WJ|I}}, "Notes", p. 302, note 30</ref>}}

For his edition of ''The Silmarillion'', Christopher used both texts of the ''Quenta Noldorinwa'' and the ''[[Wanderings of Húrin]]''. He, therefore, had to edit the first one so Maeglin would give Morgoth "the ''very'' place of Gondolin.<ref name=Notes/>

There are notable similarities between Gondolin and [[:Wikipedia:Troy|Troy]], especially between the more detailed early Lost Tale and the account of the [[:Wikipedia:Trojan War|Fall of Troy]] as told by Virgil in his ''[[:Wikipedia:Aeneid|Aeneid]]''. Both cities have their origins in the God of the Sea, as the [[:Wikipedia:Poseidon#Walls of Troy|walls of Troy]] were built by Poseidon/Neptune. Both also are doomed because of treachery (one internal, the other external) and while their citizens celebrated a feast. Both Aeneas and Tuor are destined to survive the destruction, managing to kill all enemies while wandering through the battle and seeing the death of their respective kings. Both also secretly lead survivors to escape the city, accompanied by their relatives (while Aeneas carries his father, Tuor carries his son).<ref>Alexander M. Bruce, "[http://dc.swosu.edu/mythlore/vol30/iss3/7/ The Fall of Gondolin and the Fall of Troy: Tolkien and Book II of The Aeneid]", ''[[Mythlore 117/118]]'', pp. 106-109</ref>
