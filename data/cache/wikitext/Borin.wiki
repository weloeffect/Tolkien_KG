'''Borin''' ({{TA|2450}} – {{TA|2711|n}}, aged 261 years) was a [[Dwarves|dwarf]] of [[Durin's folk]].

==History==
Borin was the younger son of [[Kings of Durin's Folk|King]] [[Náin II]]. During his youth, the [[House of Durin]] lived in the [[Dragons|dragon]]-plagued [[Grey Mountains]] that were ruled by his brother [[Dáin I]].

When the King and his son [[Frór]] were slain by a [[Cold-drake]], Durin's folk divided. Borin followed the new King [[Thrór]] back to [[Lonely Mountain]], while others followed [[Grór]] to the [[Iron Hills]]. Borin lived with the [[Dwarves of Erebor]] under [[King under the Mountain|King]] Thrór for the rest of his life.

Through his son, [[Farin]], Borin was the ancestor of four of the thirteen Dwarves of [[Thorin and Company]] ([[Balin]], [[Dwalin]], [[Óin]], and [[Glóin]]) and [[Gimli|Gimli Elf-friend]] of the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Company of the Ring]].<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[Jim Allan]] has suggested that ''Borin'' might be derived from [[Old Norse]] ''bora'' ("to bore holes"), thus meaning "Borer".<ref>[[Jim Allan]], "Giving of Names", in ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', p. 224</ref>
