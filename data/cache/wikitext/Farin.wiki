'''Farin''' was a [[Dwarves|dwarf]] of [[Durin's folk]].

== History ==
Farin was one of the [[Dwarves of the Grey Mountains]]. When his uncle King [[Dáin I]] and cousin [[Frór]] had been slain by a [[Cold-drakes|Cold-drake]], his people were forced to flee the [[Dragons|dragon]]-plagued [[Grey Mountains]] while he was just 29 years old. Farin's father, [[Borin]], joined [[Thrór]] when he rebuilt the [[Lonely Mountain|Kingdom under the Mountain]] in {{TA|2590|n}}.<ref name=Durin/>

Farin was the father of [[Fundin]] and [[Gróin]], and therefore an ancestor to both [[Balin]] of [[Thorin and Company]] and [[Gimli|Gimli Elf-friend]], one of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]].<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref>

In {{TA|2770|n}} the dragon [[Smaug]] [[Sack of Erebor|sacked the Lonely Mountain]], driving its people into exile.

== Etymology ==
[[Jim Allan]] has suggested that ''Farin'' is derived from [[Old Norse]] ''farinn'' ("travelled-one").<ref>{{HM|IE}}, "Giving of Names", p. 224</ref>
