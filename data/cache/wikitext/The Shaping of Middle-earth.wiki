'''''The Shaping of Middle-earth''''', published in [[1986]], is the fourth volume of [[Christopher Tolkien]]'s 12-volume book series, ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', in which he analyzes the unpublished manuscripts of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. 

==Overview==
In ''The Shaping of Middle-earth'' the gradual transition from the "primitive" [[legendarium|legendaria]] of ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' to what would become ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' is described, and it contains a text which could be seen as the first "Silmarillion" - the "Sketch of the Mythology".

Three other parts are the ''Ambarkanta'' or "Shape of the World", a collection of maps and diagrams of the world described by Tolkien; and the Annals of [[Valinor]] and [[Beleriand]], chronological works which started out as timelines but gradually turned into full narratives.

==Contents==
* Preface

* I. "[[Prose Fragments Following the Lost Tales]]" — brief, uncompleted texts which continue on from ''The Book of Lost Tales''

* II. "[[The Earliest 'Silmarillion']]" — or, the "Sketch of the Mythology", this is the start of the ''Silmarillion'' proper

* III. "[[The Quenta]]" — ''Quenta Noldorinwa'', a further developed version of that which appears in the "Sketch"
** Appendix 1: Ælfwine's translation of the ''Quenta'' into Old English
** Appendix 2: [[The Horns of Ylmir]]

* IV. "[[The First 'Silmarillion' Map]]" — a reproduction of the first map of Beleriand

* V. "[[The Ambarkanta]]" — cosmological essays, maps, and diagrams

* VI. "[[The Earliest Annals of Valinor|The Earliest ''Annals of Valinor'']]"
** Appendix: Ælfwine's translation of the ''Annals of Valinor'' into Old English

* VII. "[[The Earliest Annals of Beleriand|The Earliest ''Annals of Beleriand'']]"
** Second version of the earliest ''Annals''
** Appendix: Ælfwine's translation of the ''Annals of Beleriand'' into Old English

* Index

The ''Annals of Valinor'' and ''Annals of Beleriand'' show the earliest outline of the chronology of the [[First Age]] as envisaged in the early 1930s. The next volume in the series, ''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]'' (1987), outlined revisions to both texts made c. 1937 as "The Later Annals of Valinor" and "The Later Annals of Beleriand".

==Inscriptions==
There is an inscription in the [[Tengwar]] characters in the first pages of every ''History of Middle-earth'' volume, written by Christopher Tolkien and describing the contents of the book. The inscription in Book IV reads:

:"''Herein are the Quenta Noldorinwa, the History of the Gnomes, the Ambarkanta or Shape of the World by [[Rúmil (elf of Tirion)|Rúmil]], the Annals of Valinor, and the Annals of Beleriand by [[Pengolod]], the Wise of Gondolin with maps of the world in the Elder Days and translations made by [[Ælfwine|Ælfwine the Mariner]] of England into the tongue of his own land.''"

==From the publisher==
{{blockquote|The fourth volume that contains the early myths and legends which led to the writing of Tolkien’s epic tale of war, The Silmarillion.<br>
In this book, the shaping of the chronological and geographical structure of the legends of Middle-earth and Valinor is spread before us.<br>
We are introduced to the hitherto unknown [[Ambarkanta]] or 'Shape of the World', the only account ever given of the nature of the imagined [[Eä|Universe]], accompanied by maps and diagrams of the world before and after the cataclysms of The War of the Gods and the [[Downfall of Númenor]]. The first map of [[Beleriand]] is also reproduced and discussed.<br>
In [[The Earliest Annals of Valinor|The Annals of Valinor]] and [[The Earliest Annals of Beleriand|The Annals of Beleriand]] we are shown how the chronology of the [[First Age]] was moulded; and the tale is told of [[Ælfwine]], the Englishman who voyaged into the [[Aman|True West]] and came to [[Tol Eressëa]], the Lonely Isle, where he learned the ancient history of [[Elves]] and [[Men]].<br>
Also included are the original 'The Silmarillion' of 1926, and the Quenta Noldorinwa of 1930 - the only version of the myths and legends of the First Age that J.R.R. Tolkien completed to their end.}}
