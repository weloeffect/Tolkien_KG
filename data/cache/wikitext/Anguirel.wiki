'''Anguirel''' was one of a pair of swords forged by [[Eöl]], the [[Dark Elf]], from an [[Wikipedia:Iron meteorite|iron meteorite]]. Both swords were black and could cleave through any earth-delved iron.

Eöl gave Anguirel's mate, [[Anglachel]], to [[Thingol]] as payment to live in [[Nan Elmoth]]. He kept Anguirel until it was stolen by his son [[Maeglin]], who fled to [[Gondolin]]. What became of it later is unknown.<ref>{{CH|5}}, p. 97</ref>

==Etymology==
The etymology of ''Anguirel'' is not as clear as that of its mate. It might mean "Iron of the Eternal Star", from ''[[ang]]'' "iron", ''[[uir]]'' "eternal" and ''[[elen|el]]'' "star".
