'''Tolman "Tom" Cotton''', also known as '''Farmer Cotton''', ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2941|n}} – [[Fourth Age]] {{FoA|19|n}}, aged 99 years) was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of [[the Shire]].

==History==
Old Tom was a renowned farmer living on [[Bywater]]'s [[South Lane]].<ref name="Scouring">{{RK|Scouring}}</ref> He was married to [[Lily Brown]], and they had five children. [[Tolman Cotton Junior|Young Tom]] was the eldest, and his siblings were [[Rose Cotton|Rosie]], [[Wilcome Cotton II|Jolly]], [[Bowman Cotton|Nick]] and [[Carl Cotton|Nibs]].<ref name="Gamgee">{{App|Gamgee}}</ref>

Farmer Cotton played an important part in the [[Battle of Bywater]], where he rallied many hobbits to fight [[Sharkey]]'s men.<ref name="Scouring"/>

At some point during the next two years, between [[13 March]] and [[6 October]], Cotton found [[Frodo]] lying ill upon a bed, clutching a white gem in a manner reminiscent of the One Ring.

==Etymology==
''Tolman'' comes from [[Old English]] ''tōl'' + ''mann'' meaning "tool person".<ref>{{HM|IE}}, "Giving of Names" p. 194</ref> In early phases of writing [[Appendix F]], Farmer Cotton's original [[Westron]] name was given as ''Tomacca Lothran''<ref>{{PM|Languages}}</ref> or (earlier) ''Tomakli Lothron''.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, note 37.</ref>
