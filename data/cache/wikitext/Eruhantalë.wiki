The '''''Eruhantalë''''' was the last of the [[Three Prayers]] to [[Ilúvatar|Eru]] spoken each year by the [[King of Númenor|King]] or [[Ruling Queen of Númenor|Queen]] of [[Númenor]]. In this ceremony, the monarch and his or her people gave thanks to Eru. It was held at the end of each autumn. During the ''Eruhantalë'', the King or Queen would ascend the [[Meneltarma]], accompanied by a silent, white-clad crowd of people. The ruler would make a prayer and a bloodless offering on the mountain's summit, while three great [[Eagles]], the [[Witnesses of Manwë]], hovered overhead.<ref name=N>{{UT|Numenor}}</ref><ref>{{UT|Aldarion}}</ref>
