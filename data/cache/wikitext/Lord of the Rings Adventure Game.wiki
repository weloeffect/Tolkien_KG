Tolkien (specifically ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit'') under license from Tolkien Enterprises.

== Further developments ==
Brian Gross has created a fantasy RPG system called ''Middle-earth Adventure Game'' (MEAG), which is a generalization and expansion of the rules created by ICE for the [[Middle-earth Quest]] books and for the Lord of the Rings Adventure Game. MEAG is specifically designed for Middle-earth gaming with new role-players in mind.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://sites.google.com/site/ambarquenta/home/the-offical-games/meag|articlename=The Middle-Earth Adventure Game (MEAG)|dated=|website=[http://sites.google.com/site/ambarquenta/ The Heren Turambarion]|accessed=2 December 2013}}</ref>
