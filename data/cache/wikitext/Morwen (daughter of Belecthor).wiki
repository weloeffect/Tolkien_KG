'''Morwen''' was the daughter of [[Belecthor I]]. She appears in [[Tolkien]]'s manuscripts for ''[[The Heirs of Elendil]]'' (a document used in constructing the timeline of the Realms in Exile for the [[Appendices]]). When Morwen's nephew, the [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward]] [[Ecthelion I]], died childless, her grandson [[Egalmoth (Steward of Gondor)|Egalmoth]] became the 18th Ruling Steward.<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 205</ref> Morwen does not appear in the published [[The Lord of the Rings Appendices|Appendices]] to the [[Lord of the Rings]].

Morwen may have been named after the [[Morwen]] of the [[First Age]], who was the daughter of [[Baragund]] of the [[House of Bëor]].

==Etymology==
''Morwen'' means "Dark Maiden" in [[Sindarin]] (from ''[[mor]]'', "dark" and the female suffix ''[[-wen]]'', "maiden").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entries ''[[môr|mor]]'', ''[[wen]]''</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
There are several drafts of the ''Heirs of Elendil'' manuscripts, identified sequentially with the letters A through D by [[Christopher Tolkien]]. In a note in Manuscript A (the earliest manuscript), Morwen is the ''sister'' of Belecthor I and grandmother of Egalmoth, creating a genealogy which has a generation too many. This error likely came as a result of how quickly Tolkien drafted the dates and genealogies in this early manuscript. In Manuscript B, Morwen's role is revised, and she becomes the sister of [[Orodreth (Steward of Gondor)|Orodreth]], continuing to appear as such in the later manuscripts.<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, pp. 205, 219-220</ref>
