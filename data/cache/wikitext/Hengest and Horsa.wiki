'''Hengest''' and '''Horsa''' were the elder sons of [[Eriol]], and one of the [[Men|Mannish]] conquerors of [[Tol Eressëa]] following the [[Faring Forth]], according to the early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''.<ref name="Hen">{{LT1|In}}, pp. 23-4</ref>

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Hengest and Horsa were born during the [[wikipedia:5th century|5th century AD]] in [[wikipedia:Heligoland|Heligoland]], an island off the coast of the [[Great Lands]], to Eriol and his wife [[Cwén]].

While Hengest and Horsa were still children, their mother died, and their father went to seek [[Tol Eressëa]], the island of the [[Elves]] in the [[West]].

After the brothers grew up, they sought vengeance on their uncle [[Beorn (son of Heden)|Beorn]] for the murder of their grandfather [[Eoh]], and afterwards became great chieftains among their people.<ref name="Hen"/>

=== The Faring Forth ===
Following the [[Faring Forth]], the disastrous attempt by the Elves of Tol Eressëa to save their [[Ilkorindi|kin]] in the Great Lands which resulted in their total defeat and eventual fading, evil Men invaded Tol Eressëa, which was now anchored near the coast of the Great Lands.<ref name="War">{{LT2|VI}}, p. 293</ref><ref group="note">According to one outline, in which it was Eriol himself who hastened the Faring Forth, Hengest and Horsa were said to have conquered the ''[[Guiðlin]]'' (i.e. [[wikipedia:Gaels|Gaels]]), one of the peoples that invaded Tol Eressëa during the Faring Forth.</ref><ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''14''', p. 294</ref>

However, some time after, Hengest and Horsa (alongside their half-brother [[Heorrenda]]) invaded Tol Eressëa as well, which would in later days become known as ''[[wikipedia:England|England]]''.<ref name="War"/>

There, Hengest established his capital at what was once the city of [[Kortirion]], which would later be known as ''Warwíc'' (in [[Old English]]), and eventually as ''[[wikipedia:Warwick|Warwick]]''; meanwhile Horsa established himself at what was once the town of [[Taruithorn]], which would later be known as ''Oxenaford'' (in [[Old English]]), and eventually as ''[[Oxford]]''.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''13''', pp. 291-2</ref>

Unlike all other Men that invaded the island, however, the sons of Eriol (Hengest, Horsa,  and Heorrenda) were friendly to the Elves, and it is through them that the [[wikipedia:English people|English people]] retained the "true tradition of the [[Elves|fairies]]".<ref name="War"/>

== Etymology ==
The names ''Hengest'' and ''Horsa'' are in [[Old English]], with ''Hengest'' meaning "stallion",<ref>{{PE|15}}, "[[Early Runic Documents]]", p. 91</ref> and ''Horsa'' meaning "horse".<ref>{{webcite|website=Behind the Name|articlename=Horsa|articleurl=http://www.behindthename.com/name/horsa}}</ref>

<nowiki>*</nowiki> The name of Hendwine's mother is not Naimi but ''[[Nelmir]]'' in the text on which the basis of his inclusion is founded upon - neither is her relation to [[Lindo]] and [[Vairë (wife of Lindo)|Vairë]] elaborated on.<ref name="Var">{{PE|15}}, "[[Names and Required Alterations]]", Appendix, ''Text X'', p. 17</ref>
