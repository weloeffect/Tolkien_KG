'''Mallor''' ({{TA|895}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 193</ref> - {{TA|1110|n}},<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 215) was the third [[King of Arthedain]].

==History==
Mallor was the son of [[Beleg (King of Arthedain)|Beleg]] and grandson of [[Amlaith]] of [[Fornost]], the founder of [[Arthedain]]. He became king at the age of 134 when his father died in {{TA|1029}},<ref name="North"/> and ruled during troubled times. 

Mallor's reign coincided with other events that would have a huge impact on [[Middle-earth]]'s history, but whose importance weren't fully recognized at the time, such as the formation of the [[White Council]], and the return of [[Sauron]] as a mysterious shadow that fell over [[Mirkwood]]. It was also the arrival ({{TA|1050}}) from across the [[Misty Mountains]] of a strange race of beings: similar to Men, but far shorter and with hairy, bootless feet. The [[Dúnedain]] called them ''[[periannath]]'', "halflings", and they were the first [[Hobbits]] to enter [[Eriador]], who would later settle the lands of former [[Arnor]] and Arthedain.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>

Mallor ruled Arthedain for eighty-one years, and was succeeded by his son, [[Celepharn]], upon his death in {{TA|1110|n}}.<ref name="North"/>

== Etymology ==
''Mallor'' is a [[Sindarin]] name. Its meaning is not glossed, but Paul Strack and David Salo suggest it is a combination of the root-form ''MAL'' ("gold", "yellow) and the suffixal form ''-lor'' of ''glaur'' ("gold(en) light").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-3063925873.html|articlename=S. ''Mallor'' m.|website=Eldamo|accessed=03 February 2022}}</ref> This theory is supported by the fact that the names of the three kings that succeeded him seem to contain the Sindarin word for silver or gold.
