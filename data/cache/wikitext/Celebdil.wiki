'''Celebdil''', also known as '''Silvertine''' and '''Zirakzigil''', was one of the three peaks that stood above the [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] city of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]]. The other two were [[Caradhras]] (''Redhorn'') and [[Fanuidhol]] (''Cloudyhead'').

Celebdil was the southernmost of the [[Mountains of Moria]] and the [[Endless Stair]] led from the deepest halls of Khazad-dûm up to [[Durin's Tower]] on the peak of the mountain. There the [[Battle of the Peak]] between [[Gandalf]] and [[Durin's Bane]] took place.<ref name="White Rider">{{HM|TT}}, "[[The White Rider]]"</ref>

==Etymology==
''Celebdil'' is the [[Sindarin]] name of [[Khuzdul]] ''Zirakzigil'', translated as the mountain Silvertine. ''Celebdil'' contains ''[[celeb]]'' ("silver") and a derivative of the [[Sundocarmë|root]] [[TIL]].<ref name="S">{{S|Elements}}, entries ''celeb'' and ''til''</ref>

''Silvertine'' contains ''tine'', "spike, sharp horn".<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 775</ref>

==Inspiration==
Tolkien wrote to his son [[Michael Tolkien|Michael]] that on a trip to Switzerland in his youth he had regretted leaving a view of two mountains: the Jungfrau and "the ''Silberhorn'' sharp against dark blue: the ''Silvertine (Celebdil)'' of my dreams."<ref>{{L|306}}</ref>
