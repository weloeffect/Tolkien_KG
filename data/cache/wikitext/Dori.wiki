'''Dori''' was a Dwarf who, being of [[Durin's Folk]], probably dwelt in the northern [[Blue Mountains]] with [[Thorin]] after the latter had settled there after [[Thráin|Thráin II]] had disappeared.<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref>  He was one of the thirteen [[Dwarves]] who journeyed to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] to reclaim the lands from the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Smaug]], and after the successful conclusion of this quest he lived with his part of the treasure at the Lonely Mountain.<ref name="Meetings">{{FR|II1}}</ref>

==History==
=== Family and birth ===
Dori's parentage is unknown, although he was a member of the [[House of Durin]] and a remote kinsman of [[Thorin|Thorin Oakenshield]].<ref name="Durin"/> He was also the brother of [[Nori]], and a cousin of [[Ori]].<ref name=Person /> His birth year is also unknown.

However, in [[Bilbo Baggins]]' account of the quest to Erebor he stated that the brothers [[Fíli]] and [[Kíli]] were the youngest of the thirteen "by some fifty years",<ref name="Hill">{{H|Hill}}</ref> and that when Thorin was missing [[Balin]] was "the eldest left".<ref>{{H|Barrels}}</ref> Since Kíli was born in {{TA|2864}} and Balin was born in {{TA|2763|n}},<ref name="Durin"/> this would put Dori's birth between {{TA|2763|n}} and c. 2814, and he would have been between c. 127 and 178 years old during the quest to Erebor.

Thorin stated that Dori was the strongest of the Dwarves in the company.<ref>{{H|Flies}}</ref>  Dori (and Nori) shared Bilbo's opinion that meals should be plentiful and frequent.,<ref name="Mutton">{{H|Mutton}}</ref> and also it is said that Dori was "a decent fellow despite his grumbling".

===The Quest of Erebor===
When Bilbo first met Dori (in the fourth group of Dwarves to arrive at [[Bag End]] alongside Nori and Ori and another set of brothers, [[Óin]] and [[Glóin]]) he was wearing a purple hood along with a silver belt, same as his brother Nori.  During the evening when Thorin called for music, Dori (along with Nori and Ori) played the flute.<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref>  

Bilbo proclaimed Dori to be "really a decent fellow"<ref name="Pan">{{H|Pan}}</ref> because thrice Dori assisted Bilbo when the hobbit might otherwise have been killed:  First, Dori carried Bilbo in the tunnels of the [[Misty Mountains]] during the escape from the goblins, but unfortunately dropped him which led to the hobbit's encounter with Gollum.<ref name="Hill"/> Upon Nori's discovery that Bilbo was gone the other Dwarves blamed Dori for losing their burglar, especially the wizard [[Gandalf]] arguing with the dwarf.  Second, during the escape from the [[Wargs]], Dori climbed down from a tree, which allowed Bilbo to scramble up Dori and into the tree.  Lastly, Bilbo grabbed Dori's legs as they were carried off by an eagle, saving them from a fire lit by Goblins, much to both Bilbo and Dori's dismay crying "My legs! My poor legs!".<ref name="Pan"/>

When [[Gandalf]] was telling the story of the company's adventures to [[Beorn]], Dori and Thorin were the first two Dwarves to show up.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref> Thorin also notes that Dori is the strongest of their company. Upon being pulled out of the barrel after escaping the [[Thranduil|Elvenking]]'s halls and arrived in [[Lake-town]], Dori, along with several others was one of the Dwarves who was waterlogged and seemed only half alive.<ref>{{H|Welcome}}</ref> 

Dori would later fight in and survive the [[Battle of Five Armies]].  He was given his share of the treasure by [[Dáin Ironfoot]], the new king under the mountain after Thorin's death at the battle by [[Bolg]], and made his home in Erebor alongside his other companions that survived the battle and would live in great wealth under King Dáin.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

===Later life===
Dori lived a wealthy life after the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. His date of death is unknown but he was still alive during the [[War of the Ring]], as mentioned by [[Glóin]] before the [[Council of Elrond]] in {{TA|3018}}.<ref name="Meetings"/> He probably fought in the [[Battle of Dale]] against [[Sauron]]'s forces, the [[Easterlings]], along with the other members of the company still alive.

==Etymology==
''Dóri'' is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. His name most likely means "Borer" or "auger-man".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
On the wet night before meeting the Trolls the prepublication version had Bombur and Bofur failing to light a fire and quarreling about it, with Dori and Nori getting into a fight.<ref>{{HH|Trolls}}, p. 91</ref>  In the published version Tolkien added a comment that [[Óin]] and [[Glóin]] were especially good at making a fire, made them the two who could not do it that night, and had them start fighting.<ref name="Mutton"/>

===Films===
'''1967: [[The Hobbit (1967 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1967 film)]]:'''
:Dori is omitted. [[Thorin|Thorin Oakenshield]] only travels with an unnamed guard and the princess of Dale.<ref name="Deitch">{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=UBnVL1Y2src|articlename=The Hobbit.mp4|dated=5 January 2012|website=YouTube|accessed=10 January 2012}}</ref>

'''1977: [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1977 film)]]:'''
:Dori is voiced by [[John Stephenson]]. Apart from Thorin, he is one of only three of the other Dwarves who speaks with any regularity ([[Balin]] and [[Bombur]] being the others). As in the book, he sometimes carries [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] on his back. He is the one to discover the Hobbit is missing during their escape from [[Goblin-town]]. Bilbo also holds onto his leg (much to his chagrin) while the [[Eagles]] are flying the Company to safety. Later, after reclaiming Erebor, you see the dwarves celebrating as Dori jokingly says about him being king under the mountain, though Thorin dismisses the dwarf's joke. During the Battle of Five Armies you see Dori, stabbed (making him possibly one of the dwarves that passed away during the battle).

'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:'''

:{{Blockquote|A distant relative of Thorin Oakenshield, Dori is the eldest amongst his brothers Ori and Nori. He is the strongest in The Company of Dwarves, and spends much of his time watching out for Ori, making sure he hasn’t caught a chill or gotten himself killed by Wargs or Goblins. Eternally pessimistic, with a natural tendency to expect the worst, Dori is nonetheless quite prepared to risk life and limb in order to get the job done.|[[Warner Bros.]]<ref name="HobbitApp">{{webcite|author=[[Warner Bros.]]|articleurl=http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hobbit-movies/id545808528|articlename=Hobbit Movies|dated=7-September-2012|website=[http://itunes.apple.com/ Apple iPhone/iPad App]|accessed=19-September-2012}}</ref>}}

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Dori is a non-playable character, who is the official "High Hoard Seeker" of [[Erebor]]. He is captured along with the gems he was bringing to the Dwarves of Othrikar by the Dourhands. The player must rescue him in Vol I, Book III, Chapter 4 "Freeing Dori". He also makes an appearance during the Dwarven Introduction quest line, at Thorin's Gate.
