'''Paladin Took II''' was the thirty-first [[Thain]] of [[the Shire]]. He was the father of [[Peregrin Took]].

==History==
===Family===
Paladin was born in {{SR|1333}} being the son and heir of [[Adalgrim Took]], and a great-grandchild of the [[Gerontius Took|Old Took]]. He married [[Eglantine Banks]], and they had several children together: [[Pearl Took|Pearl]] (born {{SR|1375|n}}) followed by [[Pimpernel Took|Pimpernel]] ({{SR|1379|n}}) and [[Pervinca Took|Pervinca]] ({{SR|1385|n}}). [[Peregrin Took|Peregrin]] ({{SR|1390|n}}) was younger, but would be Paladin's heir.<ref name="Took">{{App|Took}}</ref>

===Becoming Thain===
Paladin was a direct descendant of the [[Gerontius Took|Old Took]], one of his great grandsons. He was member of a junior branch of the Took family, where [[Hildigrim Took|Hildigrim]] was head of that branch.<ref name="Took"/> He became a farmer, farming the lands around [[Whitwell]] near [[Tuckborough]].<ref>{{RK|MT}}</ref> Never did he expect to become Thain as at the time of his birth the Thainship was in the hands of, [[Isumbras Took IV|Isumbras IV]], his great uncle. Isumbras IV's succession appeared secure since he had both a son and grandson, [[Fortinbras Took II|Fortinbras II]] and [[Ferumbras Took III|Ferumbras III]]. However, Ferumbras III died without an heir in {{SR|1415}} and Fortinbras II had had no other sons, so the Thainship passed to Paladin, the most senior male-line relative.<ref name="L214">{{L|214}}</ref> 

In {{SR|1401}} he attended [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]] with his children.<ref name="Took"/>

===War of the Ring===
Paladin never agreed with [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]]' attempt to take over [[the Shire]] as he believed that if anyone were going to the "Chief" it should be the legitimate [[Thain of the Shire]], therefore Paladin and the other Tooks stood up to Lotho and his [[Ruffians]]. The [[Took Family|Took]]s hid in their deep dwellings of [[Great Smials]], and the ruffians could not get them, and if any ruffians were found in the [[Tookland]] they were shot and killed, an act which led the ruffians to become harsher.<ref name="Scouring">{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>

At this time, Paladin's son [[Peregrin Took|Peregrin]] and [[Travellers|three other hobbits]], were lost in the [[Old Forest]] by all accounts. Their return was unexpected, but Paladin fully embraced their suggestion to drive out the Ruffians. He sent a hundred Tooks with his son to the [[Battle of Bywater]], and commanded the remainder of his troops cleaning up the area south of the village.<ref name="Scouring"/>

===Death===
Paladin died in {{SR|1434}} at the age of 101, and after having been Thain for nineteen years, he was succeeded by his son who became Thain Peregrin I.<ref name="Took"/>

==Etymology==
The name ''Paladin'' is derived from Latin ''palatinus'', which means "palace officer".<ref name="IE">{{HM|IE}}, The Giving of Names, p. 192</ref> It was used for the twelve peers of [[wikipedia:Charlemagne|Charlemagne]],<ref name="IE"/> the emperor of the [[wikipedia:Carolingian Empire|Carolingian Empire]], an empire in Western and Central Europe that was dominated by the [[wikipedia:Franks|Franks]].

A "[[wikipedia:Paladin|paladin]]" is a high office which existed in medieval Europe - which entered into many tales - and was a noble office held by an honourable and valiant knight.
