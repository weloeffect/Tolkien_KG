== Lyrics ==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
From ashes and fire be broken 
A light from the shadows shall spring 
Renewed shall be blade that was broken 
The crownless shall again be king 

The world is grey, the mountains old 
The forge's fire is ashen and cold 
No harp is wrung, no hammer falls 
The darkness dwells in Durin's halls 

The shadow lies upon his tomb 
But still the sunken stars appeal 
In the dark and windless Mirrormere 
There lies his crown in water deep 

'Til Durin wakes again from sleep 
A deadly sword, a healing hand 
A trumpet - voice, a burning hand 
A lord of Wisdom... 

Fire and shadow - both defied 
In Khazad-Dum his wisdom died 
In joy thou hast lived 

If thou hearest the cry 
of the Gull on the shore 
Thy soul shall then rest 
in the forest no more...
</poem>
