{{blockquote|[J.R.R. Tolkien] has throughout acted as my advisor and collaborator in the conduct and policy of the department as a whole....I have never consulted him without gaining an illumination that can penetrate as well as expatiate. But I must not omit to mention that I have gained at least as much from the keen artistic sensibility as from the science of his scholarship.|Lascelles Abercrombie, [[25 June]], [[1925]]<ref name="CG"/>}}
