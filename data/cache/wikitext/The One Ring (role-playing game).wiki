The Second Edition of The One Ring is now set in the lone-lands of [[Eriador]], in the year 2965 of the Third Age, moving the focus of the game to the lands of Old [[Arnor]], with a full description of the town of [[Bree]], including also famous locales like [[Weathertop]], [[Fornost]] and [[Annuminas]], providing the players with a new starting point for their adventures.<ref name=TOR2/>
==Game system==

''The One Ring'' uses custom dice, specifically a twelve sided die numbered 1-10, the "Eye of Sauron", and the "Gandalf" Rune (a [[Cirth]] G rune, <em style="font-family: 'Cirth Erebor'; font-style: normal;">r</em>), and 6 sided dice numbered normally, but with the 1-3 being in outline, 4-5 solid, and 6 solid having also the [[Tengwar]] [[Lambe]] rune, {{tg|mode=smith|j}}. Standard 12-sided dice can be used, counting 11 as Sauron, and 12 as Gandalf, and standard 6 sided dice as well.<ref>The One Ring RPG, Adventurer Book, pages 24-25</ref>
