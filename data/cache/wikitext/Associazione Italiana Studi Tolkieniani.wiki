The AIST headquarters are based in the '''Tana del Drago''' (English: "Dragon's Lair"), located in [https://www.fondazionedozza.it/ Dozza Imolese], one of Emilia-Romagna's most beautiful medieval villages. The Tana del Drago is a at the same time a centre for studies focused on [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and the fantastic, a museum devoted to the exhibition of work of arts, books, games and handcrafted objects inspired by the Professor, and a place where his fans can reunite and play their favorite tabletop or roleplaying games set in [[Middle-earth]].

The Dragon's Lair owes its name to '''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYDZbyJX1bw Fyrstan]''', a dragon who has elected the main tower of Dozza's Castle ([https://www.fondazionedozza.it/entra-in-rocca/la-rocca-di-dozza.html Rocca di Dozza]), only a few hundred meters from the Tana, as its residence.
