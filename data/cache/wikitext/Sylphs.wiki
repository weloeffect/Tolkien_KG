'''Sylphs''' were creatures only mentioned fleetingly in the earliest versions of the [[legendarium]] and nomenclature by the [[Eldar]].<ref name=LT1-66>{{LT1|III}}, p. 66</ref><ref>{{LB|C13}}, pp. 301, 306 (§4077-9)</ref>

== Characteristics and divisions ==
The sylphs were part of what apparently was a three-fold division of the lesser [[Ainur|Ainu]] spirits: sylphs (spirits of the air), [[sprites]] (spirits of the earth), and [[mermaids|water spirits]].<ref name=LT1-66/>

[[Manwë]] had "''two clans of air-spirits''",<ref name=PE11/> a basic division of two groups of sylphs which, with their [[Elvish]] names, are given as follow:

*[[Qenya]] '''''Mánir''''' (or ''Mānir''<ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 31</ref>): "spirits of the air";<ref name=LT1Index>{{LT1|Index}}</ref> [[Gnomish]] ''môna'' or ''môni''<ref name=PE11>{{PE|11}}, pp. 57, 68</ref>
*[[Qenya]] '''''Súruli'''''/''Sūruli'', also ''Suluthrim'') (sing. ''Sūru''): "spirits of the winds"; [[Gnomish]] ''Sulus'' (pl. ''Sulussin'')<ref name=PE11/><ref name=LT1Index/>

An individual Súru mentioned by name was '''[[Ilinsor]]''', steersman of the [[Moon]]. Ilinsor "''loved the snows and the starlight and aided [[Varda]] in many of her works''".<ref>{{LT1|VIII}}, pp. 192-5</ref>

== Commentary ==
It has been suggested that the concept "air spirits" is used "metaphorically [...] for the winds that these spirits govern".<ref>{{PE|16}}, p. 59</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
Sylphs are not mentioned in the later versions of the [[legendarium]]. Many of the classes of beings references in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' were superseded by the concept of the [[Maiar]], which were not introduced until the reworking of the [[Annals of Valinor]] into the [[Annals of Aman]].<ref name="MRP2b">{{MR|P2b}}</ref>

== Inspiration ==
[[Patrick H. Wynne]] and [[Christopher Gilson]] have noted that Tolkien's use of sylphs (and related spirits) is likely influenced by [[Wikipedia:Paracelsus|Paracelsus]]'s chart of four elementals: ''sylphs'' (air), ''pygmies'' or ''gnomes'' (earth), ''nymphs'' (water), and ''salamanders'' (fire).<ref>{{PE|14}}, p. 8</ref>
