'''Turgon''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2855|n}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 206</ref> – {{TA|2953|n}},<ref>{{App|South}}</ref> aged 98 years) was the twenty-fourth [[Ruling Steward]] of [[Gondor]].

==History==
Turgon was the son of Steward [[Túrin II]]. Unlike his father's reign (and his son's), his rule was apparently peaceful and uneventful, as no significant events for Gondor are recorded during those thirty-nine years.

However, it was near the end of his rule, in {{TA|2951}}, when [[Sauron]] declared himself openly in [[Mordor]]; he gathered his power there, and began rebuilding [[Barad-dûr]].<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>

His son [[Ecthelion II|Ecthelion]] succeeded him to the throne.

==Etymology==
For the meaning of his name refer to [[Turgon#Etymology|Turgon - Etymology]]. Turgon was probably named after [[Turgon]], a [[High King of the Noldor]] of the [[First Age]] who founded the hidden city of [[Gondolin]].<ref>{{NM|P2v}}, footnote 3, p. 189</ref><ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 203</ref>
