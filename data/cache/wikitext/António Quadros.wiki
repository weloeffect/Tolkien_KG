'''António Augusto de Melo Lucena e Quadros''' (also, '''António Quadros''') ([[9 June]] [[1933]] - [[2 July]] [[1994]]) was a Portuguese graphic artist, best known for his work in illustration, comic strip and comic book genres. 

António Quadros became the first Portuguese illustrator of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s work, when he contributed drawings for the first Portuguese-language edition of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' ([[O Gnomo]]).

Quadros's illustrations to ''[[The Hobbit]]'' did not please Tolkien. [[Clyde S. Kilby]], wrote in his memoir, ''[[Tolkien and The Silmarillion]]'', that Tolkien regarded the Portuguese illustrations as "horrible."
