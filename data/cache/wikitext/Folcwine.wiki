'''Folcwine''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2830|n}} – {{TA|2903|n}}, aged 73 years) was the fourteenth [[King of Rohan]].

==History==
Folcwine was the son of [[Folca]] "The Hunter", and great-grandfather of [[Théoden]]. Aided by [[Gondor]], he drove out [[Dunlendings]] who occupied the area between [[Adorn]] and [[Isen]] and recovered that area.

In {{TA|2885}} he also fulfilled the [[Oath of Eorl]] and sent many Rohirrim to the aid of Gondor against the [[Haradrim]]. However his twin sons [[Folcred]] and [[Fastred (son of Folcwine)|Fastred]] were both killed in that war, and Folcwine was succeeded by his youngest child, [[Fengel]].<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref><ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Folcwine'' is an [[Old English]] name. It means "friend of the people" and is composed of ''folc'' ("folk" or "people") and ''wine'' ("friend").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 644</ref>
