'''Déor''' ([[Third Age]] 2644 – 2718, aged 74 years) was the seventh [[King of Rohan]].

==History==
Déor was born during the rule of his great-great-grandfather, [[Aldor]] the Old. He himself became king at age 55, following the death of [[Goldwine|his father]]. During Déor's kingship the peace of Rohan (which had begun during [[Aldor]]'s reign) came to an end - the [[Dunlendings]] took to raiding the herds and studs of the [[Rohirrim]] over the River [[Isen]].<ref>{{App|Mark}}</ref>  

When it became clear that the raiders were coming from near [[Isengard]], in {{TA|2710}} King Déor led an expedition to the north.  He found and defeated a host of Dunlendings, but discovered that [[Isengard]] was held by hostile forces.  Secure in the fortress they could not be dislodged and [[Egalmoth (Steward of Gondor)|Egalmoth]] could not send help. Instead Déor kept a strong force of riders in the north of the [[Westfold]].<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref>

Déor's reign lasted nineteen years. He was succeeded as King by his son, [[Gram]].

==Etymology==
Déor means "brave" or "bold" in [[Old English]].<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 643</ref><ref>{{webcite|website=[http://www.bosworthtoller.com/ Bosworth-Toller Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]|articleurl=https://bosworthtoller.com/7607|articlename=deór|accessed=24 July 2025}}</ref>
