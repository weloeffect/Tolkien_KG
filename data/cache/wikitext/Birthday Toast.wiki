"'''Frodo's custom'''" was an event held each year at a small gathering in honour of both [[Bilbo Baggins]]' and [[Frodo Baggins]]' birthdays, held each year on the [[22 September|22nd of September]] at [[Bag End]] (both Hobbits shared the same birthday). This custom began after Bilbo left Bag End after the celebration of his 111th birthday.<ref>{{FR|Three}}, p. 68</ref>

== Tolkien Society tradition ==
The '''Birthday Toast''' is a tradition upheld by [[The Tolkien Society]] in honour of the creator of Bilbo and Frodo - [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and is held on the author's birthday, [[3 January|3rd January]], each year. The 'toast' itself is: "The Professor!".<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://www.tolkiensociety.org/society/events/toast/|articlename=Tolkien Birthday Toast|dated=|website=TS|accessed=29 April 2025}}</ref>
