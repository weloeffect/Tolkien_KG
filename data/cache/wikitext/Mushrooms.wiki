{{Quote|I suppose you three won't want mushrooms again?|[[Fredegar Bolger]]<ref name="Cut"/>}}

'''Mushrooms''' were an edible [[funguses|fungus]]. It is said that Hobbits have a passion for mushrooms, surpassing even the greediest likings of [[Men|Big People]].<ref name="Cut"/>

==History==
Mushrooms were a particular delight of young [[Frodo Baggins]], who would often steal them from [[Farmer Maggot]]'s fields. Old Maggot still remembered it when Frodo came to his [[Bamfurlong|farm]] years later, and as a parting gift, [[Mrs. Maggot]] gave Frodo a basket of the prized mushrooms.<ref name="Cut">{{HM|FR}}, "[[A Short Cut to Mushrooms]]"</ref> 

==Inspiration==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] described himself as a Hobbit in all but size, noting that he was very fond of mushrooms.<ref name="L213">{{L|213}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In a note discussing the [[Drúedain]], Tolkien made mention about the fungi in the [[First Age]]: they were generally considered ugly and dangerous by the [[Elves]] and most of the [[Edain]], and the less wise called them "ork-plants", believing them cursed and  blighted by [[Morgoth]]. The Eldar did not eat them and only a few Edain knew how to distinguish the edible ones and could eat them because of great hunger when lost in the wild. The Drúedain had a lore of plants and ate fungi with pleasure (to the astonishment of the other peoples), and they cultured their favorite ones. They passed this knowledge to the [[Haladin]] who ate them when guests out of courtesy, and resolved to them at need. Tolkien later discarded the note believing that this trait made the Drúedain "too like Hobbits".<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, n. 52</ref>
