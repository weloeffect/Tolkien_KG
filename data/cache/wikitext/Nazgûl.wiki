The '''[[#Etymology|Nazgûl]]''' ([[Black Speech]] for "'''Ringwraiths'''"), also known as the '''Nine Riders''' or '''Black Riders''' (or simply '''the Nine'''), were [[Sauron]]'s "most terrible servants" in [[Middle-earth]]. They were mortal [[Men]] who had been turned into wraiths by their [[Nine Rings]] of power.

==History==
===Origins===
Sometime during the [[Second Age]] (after the year {{SA|1697|n}}<ref group="note">Sauron captured the Rings of Power in the [[Sack of Eregion]] around this year, and later distributed the Nine Rings (cf. {{App|B}} and {{UT|Concerning}}).</ref>) Sauron gave [[Nine Rings|nine Rings of Power]] to nine mortal [[Men]]. It is said that three of the Nine were great lords of [[Númenoreans|Númenorean]] race.<ref name="Akallabeth">{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref><ref>{{L|156|39}}, "There were evil Númenoreans: Sauronians, [...] the wicked Kings who had become the Nazgûl or Ringwraiths."</ref>

The bearers of the rings gained great wealth and prestige and became "''mighty in their day, kings, sorcerers, and warriors of old''". The rings enabled them to turn invisible and see the [[Unseen]]. Their lives were prolonged so they seemed unending, but life became unendurable to them. Over time, depending on their native strength and their initial good or evil will, they succumbed to the powers of the rings and the domination of the [[The One Ring|One Ring]]. Their bodily forms faded until they became permanently invisible and turned into [[wraiths]].<ref name="Rings" />

Known as the Nazgûl, they first appeared around {{SA|2251}}<ref name="AppB1" /> and were soon established as Sauron's principal servants. However, the circumstances of this appearance are unknown, as are their actions during the [[Dark Years]], during Sauron's capture to [[Númenor]], and in the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. When Sauron was overthrown in {{SA|3441}} at the hands of the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|Last Alliance]], the wraiths faded into the shadows.<ref name="AppB1">{{App|B1}}</ref>
===Third Age===
The One Ring which dominated the Nazgûl was taken from Sauron and then it was lost in [[Anduin]] for the following centuries; both Sauron and the wraiths lost their powers and remained hidden.<ref name="Rings" /> However around {{TA|1050|n}} of the [[Third Age]] Sauron returned in the form of a shadow in [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]], triggering also the return of his servants. [[Third Age 1100|About 50 years later]] [[the Wise]] of that Age discovered the [[shadow]] of [[Dol Guldur]] and theorized that it was one of the Nazgûl.<ref name="AppB2" /> 

But it was around {{TA|1300}} when evil things, like the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]], multiplied again, and the Nazgûl definitely reappeared; it was then when [[Witch-king|Lord of the Nazgûl]] gathered evil [[Men]] and founded the Witch-kingdom of [[Angmar]]. From there he led Sauron's forces against the mannish kingdom of [[Arnor]] in {{TA|1409}}.<ref name="AppB2" />  

Meanwhile [[Gondor]] was weakened by the [[Great Plague]] and [[Wainrider/Balchoth War|War]], and it was believed that Sauron's plan was to open the way to [[Mordor]]; indeed as the watch on Mordor stopped and Gondor's borders withdrew, it is believed that the Nazgûl freely re-entered Mordor around {{TA|1856|n}} or later.<ref name="gondor">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

The Witch-king was eventually [[Battle of Fornost|defeated]] in battle in {{TA|1975|n}} and [[Third Age 1980|sometime later]] returned to [[Mordor]], gathering the other Nazgûl in preparation for the return of Sauron to that realm.<ref name="AppB2" /><ref name="gondor" /> 

In {{TA|2000|}}, they issued by [[Cirith Ungol]], began a two-year siege against [[Minas Ithil]] and [[Second Fall of Minas Ithil|captured it]]. The city thereafter became their stronghold Nazgûl, from where they directed the rebuilding of Sauron's armies, also acquiring [[Ithil-stone|one of]] the ''[[palantíri]]'' for the Dark Lord.<ref name="AppB2">{{App|B2}}</ref>

During the [[Watchful Peace]], when Sauron hid from the power of the [[White Council]], the Nazgûl also remained hidden in [[Morgul Vale]], allowing some peaceful time for the first [[Ruling Stewards]] of Gondor.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref>

But after his defeat in [[Dol Guldur]], Sauron returned to Mordor in {{TA|2942|n}} and declared himself openly in {{TA|2951|n}}. Three of the Nazgûl were sent to his fortress at Dol Guldur to garrison that outpost.<ref name="AppB2" />
[[File:Angus McBride - Rivendell.gif|thumb|''Rivendell'' by [[Angus McBride]]]]
In {{TA|3017|n}} Sauron commanded the Ringwraiths to recover [[the One Ring]] of Power from "Baggins of the Shire". Disguised as horse riders clad in black (hence the term ''Black Riders''), they sought out [[Bilbo Baggins]] who, as [[Gollum]] had revealed, had the One Ring in his possession.

The [[Dwarves]] of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] spoke of a rider who had come to offer Sauron's friendship and ask about [[Hobbits]]. As a token of their friendship he asked for a "trifle", a ring, "the least of rings", that the [[Bilbo Baggins|thief]] had stolen.<ref name="council">{{FR|II2}}</ref><ref group="note">The identity of the messenger is unknown. In [[fandom]] it has been proposed that he was the [[Mouth of Sauron]]. [[Michael Martinez]] [http://middle-earth.xenite.org/2012/01/26/is-the-messenger-sent-to-dain-a-black-rider-or-the-mouth-of-sauron/ considers it more likely] that it was a Nazgûl.</ref>

===War of the Ring===
Sauron decided to assault Gondor directly. In [[Sauron's attack on Osgiliath|attack]] on [[Osgiliath]] he let the Nazgûl lead, causing terror with the [[Black Shadow]] among the [[Gondorians]]<ref name="council" /><ref name="b3">{{app|B3}}</ref> and making them think that they are the vanguard of Sauron's military force. However this was a feigned move of Sauron, who intended them to send them invisible to look for the Ring.<ref name="hunt">{{UT|Hunt}}</ref>

The Nazgûl were given black horses (stolen from [[Rohan]]) for transportation and set off to find "[[the Shire]]", on their way learning from a [[Squint-eyed southerner]] that [[Saruman]] was not a true ally of Sauron. Failing to find it, they returned to the [[Wold]] empty-handed; messengers from Sauron sent them to [[Isengard]]. There they encountered [[Gríma Wormtongue]], who told them of the location of the Shire.<ref name="hunt" /> 

Crossing the [[Fords of Isen]], they reached [[Sarn Ford]] at evening and drove off the guard of [[Rangers of the North]] and five pursued the Rangers eastward, then returned to guard the [[Greenway]]. The other four entered the Shire before the dawn of [[23 September]]; at nightfall [[Khamûl]] came to [[Hobbiton]] and interrogated [[Hamfast Gamgee]] asking for "[[Baggins]]", not knowing that [[Frodo Baggins]], the [[Ring-bearer]], had left Bag End on his way out of Hobbiton that same day.<ref name="b3" /> 

On [[24 September]] a Rider approached Frodo and his companions near the [[Woody End]], when a [[Wandering Companies|Wandering Company]] of [[Elves]] approached from [[Emyn Beraid]], chanting the name of "[[Elbereth]]", and the rider fled away.<ref name="Three">{{FR|Three}}</ref>{{rp|78–9}} The [[25 September|next day]] a Rider came to [[Bamfurlong]] and approached [[Farmer Maggot]], asking about Baggins. The farmer directed him to Hobbiton. The Rider said that the individual had already left Hobbiton and offered Maggot gold if he would inform the rider if he saw Baggins. The farmer felt chill and was enraged by his trespassing and threatened him with his [[dogs]], which, however, yelped and ran. The Rider, infuriated by his defiance, hissed and rode away.<ref>{{FR|I4}}</ref>

On [[26 September]], two Riders came to ''[[The Prancing Pony]]'' at [[Bree]] and asked [[Nob]] for "Baggins", making the dogs and geese noisy. Nob, terrified, slammed the door on them, and the Riders continued all the way to [[Archet]].<ref name="strid">{{FR|Strider}}</ref>

Three days later, on [[29 September]] at night, the hobbits arrived at the ''Prancing Pony''.<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3018, September 29, p. 1093</ref> On the same day, three Riders arrived in Bree and were informed by a spy from Isengard about the events with the Hobbits that took place at the ''Prancing Pony'' and guessed that the One Ring is present. One Rider was sent to find the Witch-king, but was stopped and driven away by the [[Dúnedain]], so that he only met the Witch-king on the next day.<ref name="PrancingRC">{{HM|RC}}, citing from the manuscript Marquette MSS 4/2/3, p. 166</ref> After [[Frodo]], [[Pippin]], and Sam returned from the big common-room to the parlour of the ''Prancing Pony'', [[Merry]] went outside for a walk, followed a shadow to the last house of the road in the dark, but began to feel terrified. After he had turned around to run back something came behind him and he fell over and became unconscious. However, [[Nob]] saw two men on the road lifting something and shouted.<ref name="strid" /> When he reached the spot on the road<ref name="strid" /> the two Riders had disappeared<ref name="PrancingRC" /> and he only found the unconscious Merry lying there<ref name="strid" />. Merry and Nob returned to the parlour and informed Frodo, Pippin, Sam, and [[Aragorn]] about what had happened. As a result, they decided to not go back to their rooms, but to spend the night in the parlour and to bar its window and door.<ref name="strid" />

In the early hours before dawn of [[30 September]], the two Riders rode through Bree and may have attacked the ''Prancing Pony'' while other Riders attacked [[Crickhollow]].<ref name="PrancingRC" /> When Aragorn and the Hobbits got up and returned to their bedrooms they discovered that the windows had been forced open, the beds had been tossed about, the bolsters had been slashed and the brown mat had been torn to pieces. At around ten o'clock Aragorn and the Hobbits left Bree eastwards on the East Road.<ref name="knife">{{FR|Knife}}</ref>

The Riders pursued [[Gandalf]] from Bree and attacked him at night on [[Weathertop]], where he defended himself with his [[magic]].<ref name="b3" /> Four Riders followed Gandalf as he escaped to the north.<ref name="council" /> The others later attacked [[Aragorn]] and the [[hobbits]] while they were camping under Weathertop, and the Witch-king [[Morgul-wound|wounded]] [[Frodo Baggins]] with a [[Morgul-knife]].<ref name="b3" /><ref name="knife" /> 

On [[11 October]] {{TA|3018|n}}<ref name="b3" /> three Riders were guarding the [[Last Bridge]] of [[Mitheithel]], expecting [[Aragorn]] and the [[hobbits]] on their journey to [[Rivendell]]. Their plan was foiled by [[Glorfindel]], who drove them away.<ref name="b3" /><ref name="Flight">{{FR|Flight}}</ref> Two days later, some of them pursued Frodo across the [[Ford of Bruinen]].<ref name="b3" /> [[Elrond]] and [[Gandalf]] released a flood and the waters of [[Bruinen]] swept away and drowned the horses of the Riders.<ref name="council" /> 

[[File:Ted_Nasmith_-_The_Nazgûl.jpg|thumb|''The Nazgûl'' by [[Ted Nasmith]].]]

The Ringwraiths were forced to return to Mordor to regroup.<ref name="Disguises">{{FR|South}}, p. 275</ref> They reappeared later mounted on [[Nazgûl-birds|flying creatures]],<ref name="White" /> at which point they were referred to as '''winged Nazgûl'''.<ref>{{TT|Uruk}}, p. 446</ref>

By the conclusion of the [[War of the Ring]], all of the Nine Nazgûl were destroyed. The [[Witch-king|Lord of the Nazgûl]] himself was slain by [[Éowyn]], the niece of King [[Théoden]] (with help from [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]]) during the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].<ref>{{RK|Battle}}, 840-2</ref> The remaining eight Ringwraiths attacked the Army of the West during the last battle at the [[Black Gate]].<ref>{{RK|Gate}}, p. 892</ref> However, when [[Frodo Baggins]] put on the ring in the fires of [[Mount Doom]], Sauron ordered the remaining Nazgûl to fly with all possible speed to Mount Doom to intercept Frodo. They arrived too late, with the Ring falling into the fire along with the hapless Gollum. The Nazgûl were caught in the firestorm of the erupting mountain and were destroyed.<ref>{{RK|Doom}}, pp. 946-7</ref>

==Characteristics==
===Appearance===
To mortals, the Nazgûl appeared as shadowy Men hidden by black hoods and cloaks that reached down to their boots.<ref name="Three" />{{rp|74}} Without their cloaks, they were shapeless,<ref name="MeetingsTwo">{{FR|Meetings}}, p. 222-3</ref> and invisible to all but the wearer of [[the One Ring]].<ref name="Rings" /> When the Witch-king removed his hood, his crown could be seen, although his head was invisible and the red fires shone through it.<ref name="Siege">{{RK|Siege}}</ref>{{rp|829}} During the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the deadly gleam of his eyes could be seen.<ref name="PelennorPage">{{RK|Battle}}, p. 840</ref>

When Frodo put on the Ring at Weathertop, he could see the forms of the Nazgûl clearly. They were tall, and beneath their black cloaks, they were robed in grey. Their hair was grey, and they wore silver helms, although the Witch-king wore a crown. Their eyes were merciless and piercing, and their hands were haggard. The Witch-king held a [[Morgul-knife|knife]], and the knife and his hand shone with a pale light.<ref name="Visible">{{FR|Knife}}, pp. 195-6</ref>

===Powers and abilities===
The chief power of the Nazgȗl was the unreasoning fear they struck in living things. Their powers and the fear that they inspired are greatly increased in darkness.<ref name="L210">{{L|210}}, 9.</ref> During the [[Siege of Gondor]], their cries were filled with evil and horror. When the Ringwraiths passed overhead unseen, even the bravest dropped their weapons from their nerveless hands or cowered on the ground due to the fear that overcame them. As a blackness entered their minds, they no longer thought about fighting, and only thought of hiding, crawling away, and death.<ref name="Siege" />{{rp|823}} Even when they could not be seen or heard, their terrible presence could be felt, and those nearby felt a sense of dread.<ref>{{RK|Gate}}, p. 886</ref> Animals also feared them, and the only creatures that endured them were horses bred for the service of Sauron<ref name="MeetingsTwo" /> and the [[Fell beasts|winged beasts]] that were given to them when their horses were destroyed.<ref name="White">{{TT|White}}, p. 498</ref> The evil aura that surrounded them was known as the ''[[Black Breath]]'', and those that came under its shadow fell ill and eventually passed into silence and died.<ref name="Houses">{{RK|Houses}}</ref>

The Ringwraiths did not have great physical power against fearless opponents.<ref name="L210" /> The Nazgûl also used physical weapons. At Weathertop, they bore steel swords, and the Witch-king had a knife that he stabbed Frodo with.<ref name="Visible" /> A shard of the [[Morgul-knife]] remained in Frodo's shoulder, and was moving deeper before it was removed by [[Elrond]]. It caused Frodo to begin to fade into the [[Unseen|wraith-world]], but the shard was unable to pierce his heart and bring him completely under the control of the Nazgȗl.<ref name="MeetingsTwo" /> The Ringwraiths were also known to use deadly black darts.<ref name="HousesPage" /> The Witch-king used a black mace during the Battle of the Pelennor Fields.<ref name="PelennorPage" />

The Nazgûl could not be slain by arrows,<ref name="White" /> and only weapons endowed with a special power, such as the [[blade of Westernesse]] that Merry used, could do them any great damage.<ref>{{RK|Battle}}, pp. 842-4</ref> Any blades that pierced the Witch-king were destroyed.<ref name="Flight" />{{rp|198}}

[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Attack of the Wraiths.jpg|thumb|''The Attack of the Wraiths'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]

The Nazgûl existed mostly in the wraith-world and required their cloaks to give them form during their interactions with the living.<ref name="MeetingsTwo" /> When their steeds and disguises were destroyed, they were forced to return to Sauron to receive new ones.<ref name="Disguises" />

The Nazgûl had poor vision in the world of light, but they were aware of the presence of other beings, and their perception grew stronger in the dark. They could detect living things by the smell of their blood, and they were drawn by the Ring.<ref name="knife" />{{rp|189}} They could also see beings with a presence in the wraith-world, such as the wearer of the One Ring, as well as certain powerful Elves with control over the Unseen, such as [[Glorfindel]]. Anyone who could see into the wraith-world could see the Nazgûl, as Frodo did on Weathertop<ref name="MeetingsTwo" /> and at the Ford of Bruinen.<ref name="FlightPage">{{FR|Flight}}, p. 214</ref>

The [[Witch-king]] could also affect objects and people with his power, and was able to strike Frodo dumb and shatter the dagger that Frodo had gotten in the [[Barrow-downs]] by raising his hand,<ref name="FlightPage" /> and he also weakened both hearts and stone with terrifying words of power while attacking the [[Great Gate of Minas Tirith|Gate]] of [[Minas Tirith]]. He also caused flames to run along his sword.<ref name="Siege" />{{rp|828–9}} Whether other Nazgûl could perform similar feats is unknown.

==Identities==
Only a few of the Nazgûl are named or identified individually. Their leader was the [[Witch-king|Witch-king of Angmar]], and his second in command was named [[Khamûl]]. Khamûl was a lord of [[Easterlings]],<ref name="Black">{{UT|Black}}</ref> and was the only Nazgûl known by his name. Three of them were [[Númenóreans]].<ref name="Akallabeth" /> 

==Etymology==
''Nazgûl'' means "ringwraiths" in the [[Black Speech]]. It is a compound of ''[[nazg]]'' ("ring") and ''[[gûl]]'' ("[evil] spirit under control of Sauron").<ref>{{PE|17}}, entry B '''Nazgûl''', p. 79</ref>

==Other names==
Among their many names and titles were: the Ringwraiths,<ref name="Shadow">{{FR|Shadow}}, p. 51</ref> the Black Riders,<ref>{{FR|Three}}, p. 80</ref> the Fell Riders,<ref>{{RK|MT}}, p. 764</ref> the Nine Riders,<ref name="FlightPage" /> the Nine,<ref name="Shadow" /> the Nine Servants of the Lord of the Rings,<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}, p. 261</ref> the Black Wings,<ref>{{TT|Gate}}, p. 646</ref> Winged Messenger(s),<ref name="White" /> the Shadows,<ref name="HousesPage">{{RK|Houses}}, p. 864</ref> the Shriekers<ref>{{RK|Shadow}}, p. 925</ref>, the Nine Ring-slaves<ref name=":0">{{L|131}}</ref>, and the Black Rider(s) of the Air<ref name=":0" />.

An [[Elvish]] name given for the Ringwraiths is '''''Úlairi'''''.<ref name="Rings">{{S|Rings}}</ref><ref>{{PM|Akallabeth}}, p. 153 (§30)</ref> Linguists have remarked that it is a [[Quenya]] plural name of unknown meaning and etymology.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/eng-quen.rtf|articlename=English-Quenya Wordlist (Quettaparma Quenyanna)|dated=|website=Arda|accessed=25 June 2011}}</ref><ref>[[Ruth S. Noel]], ''[[The Languages of Tolkien's Middle-earth]]''</ref> [[Michael Martinez]], analysing the word, has tentatively suggested that: 

{{blockquote| ''Úlairi'' is a compound formed from ''Ú'' + ''lai'' + ''ri'' with probable meaning of "un (bad or immoral)" + "shadow" + "ones". In other words, the name may mean something like "those who are in/of unnatural shadow".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Michael Martinez]]|articleurl=http://middle-earth.xenite.org/2014/08/15/what-is-the-literal-translation-of-ulairi/|articlename=What is the Literal Translation of Úlairi?|dated=15 August 2014|website=[http://middle-earth.xenite.org/ middle-earth.xenite.org]|accessed=16 August 2014}}</ref>}}

==Other versions of the legendarium==
The first appearance of a Black Rider in Tolkien's drafts was actually a disguised [[Gandalf]] who scared the Hobbits on their way to Rivendell, before revealing himself.<ref>{{RS|Hobbiton}}</ref>

Later, Gandalf, following Galadriel's advice, visits the High Fells and discovers that the Nazgûl's cells were empty, broken open from the inside. Through this investigation, he is convinced that the Necromancer in Dol Guldur is indeed Sauron.

:During the [[Attack on Dol Guldur]] they appeared in armour, ghostly versions of their mortal forms. The Nine do battle with Galadriel, [[Saruman]], and Elrond.

'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'':'''
:The Mordor faction has two different Nazgûl units: "Witch-king on Fell Beast" and "Nazgûl on Fell Beast". They are primarily used for scouting and surprise attacks.

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:A new Ringwraith is introduced in the expansion pack, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king|The Rise of the Witch-king]]''. Morgomir is the "Lieutenant of Carn-Dûm", the right-hand man of the Witch-king, of [[Black Númenóreans|Black Númenórean]] descent. The design is similar to that in [[Peter Jackson]]'s films: he is hooded and cloaked when he works for the [[Mordor]] faction, and white and ghostly when he fights for Angmar.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The Nazgûl appear throughout the game. Three are Easterlings: "The Bane of Rhûn", "The Woe of Khand", and "The Cursed Rider"; three are [[Haradrim]]: "The Grim Southron", "The High Sorcerer of Harad", and "The Forsaken Reaver"; and three are of Númenórean origin: "The Black Blade of Lebennin", "The Gloom of Nurn", and the Witch-king of Angmar. The Nazgûl are also given the [[Sindarin]] name "Gwatharan" (pl. "Gwetherain").

:Early in the game one of the Nine wounds a [[Dúnedain]] ranger, Amdir, with a [[Morgul-knife|Morgul blade]], who is later transformed into a Wraith himself, despite the best efforts of Free Peoples. Later, the player attempts to resist the troubles the Nine are spreading in Bree-Land. During the Fellowship's stay in [[Lothlórien]], the [[Galadhrim]] Elves launch a military strike against [[Dol Guldur]], to draw the attention of the Eye from the company departing down the Shores of Anduin. During their travel down the waters of the Great River, Legolas shot and killed a fell shadow in the sky, not knowing it to be a Nazgûl. The player is later able to find the corpse of the fell beast in the [[Brown Lands]] and it becomes clear that a Nazgûl is not far. At night, the Wraith ambushes the player who manages to drive him away with the use of fire.

:During the Battle of the Pelennor, the Witch-king plays the role as described in the books. The High Sorcerer of Harad and the Woe of Khand guard the way to Gothmog in the raid instance "Throne of the Dread Terror", and the Forsaken Reaver is found at the end of the "Quays of the [[Harlond (Gondor)|Harlond]] instance, in which he attempts to prevent Aragorn and his host from joining the battle.  The Gloom of Nurn confronts the players at the conclusion of "The Silent Street" instance, as he attempts to reclaim the crown of Eärnur among the tombs of Gondor's kings and stewards.

'''2009: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'':'''
:In the Evil Campaign, the Eight Nazgûl bring the Witch-King back to life after Sauron reclaims the One Ring.

'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''
:The Nazgûl appear in a flashback during the prologue of the game, in which they attack the [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]] at [[Sarn Ford]], the entrance of [[the Shire]]. Later in the flashback their leader, the [[Witch-king]], speaks with [[Agandaûr]].<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], ''Prologue''</ref>

'''2014: ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]'':'''
:Although the Nazgûl do not appear in the game, they are mentioned many times within it.

'''2017: ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]]'':'''
:The Nazgûl are featured in the game. Besides the [[Witch-king]] and [[Khamûl]] the other Nazgûl include:

:*[[Helm|Helm Hammerhand]], the king of Rohan who fell into darkness after receiving a Ring of Power from Sauron and Celebrimbor, and in his rage he was turned into a Nazgûl.
:*[[Talion]], who succumbed into the power of the Ring.
:*[[Isildur]], whose body was found by Orcs. He was revived by Sauron after receiving a Ring of Power; he was eventually freed by Talion who took his place amongst the Nazgûl.
:*Suladân, an original character, who was once a Númenórean king.
:*The Nazgûl Sisters, also original characters, known as Riya and Yuka, who stole their Rings from the other Nazgûl and took their places.

'''2022: ''[[War of the Ring: The Card Game]]'':'''
:The seven unnamed Nazgûl are given titles: ''[[:File:John Howe - The Reaver.jpg|The Reaver]]'', ''[[:File:John Howe - The Commander.jpg|The Commander]]'', ''[[:File:Jon Hodgson - The Destroyer.jpg|The Destroyer]]'',<ref>[https://issuu.com/aresgames/docs/wotr101-waroftheringcardgame-rulebook-en-web War of the Ring - The Card Game (English Rulebook) by.
