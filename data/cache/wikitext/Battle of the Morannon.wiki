The '''Battle of the Morannon'''<ref>''[[The Chronology of The Lord of the Rings]]'', V. A Published Chronology: Appendix B, 1. "Here at the end of all things", pp. 149 (entry for March 25 in Table 14 ''continued'')</ref> was the last major battle against [[Sauron]] in the [[War of the Ring]], fought at the Black Gate of [[Mordor]] on [[25 March]] {{TA|3019}}.<ref name=Great>{{App|Great}}</ref> The army of the West, 6,000 strong by now, led by [[Aragorn]] marched on the gate as a diversionary feint to distract [[Sauron]]'s attention from [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], who were carrying the [[One Ring]] through Mordor. It was hoped that Sauron would think Aragorn had the Ring and was now trying to use it to overthrow Mordor.<ref>{{RK|V9}}</ref>

==History==
===Prelude===
{{seealso|Last Debate}}
Initially, the Army of the West had been composed of 7,000 men, but many were stationed at various places along the way. A strong guard of archers were stationed at the [[Cross-roads]], in case enemy troops came from the [[Cirith Ungol|Morgul Pass]] or from the South.  In addition, Aragorn dismissed the faint of heart, who would not go to the [[Dagorlad]], ordering them to liberate [[Cair Andros]] on the river Anduin. This resulted in the departure of 1,000 men, leaving 6,000 to continue on towards the [[Black Gate]]. Upon arrival, Aragorn defensively arrayed his forces upon two [[Slag-hills]] with a mire of mud and stinking pools between his army and the Gate.

Before the battle began, Sauron sent one of his servants, the [[Black Númenóreans|Black Númenórean]] called the [[Mouth of Sauron]], to speak with the Captains of the West. He tried to trick [[Gandalf]] into believing Sauron held Frodo captive, displaying as evidence items that had belonged to Frodo and Sam (Sam's sword, an [[Elven cloaks|Elven cloak]], and Frodo's [[Mithril-coat]]) The Mouth threatened that Frodo would be tortured if the West did not agree to Sauron's terms of surrender. The terms included: the disbanding of the armies of the West, an oath to never take up arms, the rebuilding of Isengard, and the turning over of all lands West to Sauron. (It is clear that while Sauron knew there was a Hobbit in Mordor, he did not know why. He also probably did not know there were two.)

Gandalf, however, refused to be swayed, took the items from the Mouth of Sauron, and sent him away. Amazed and angered, the Mouth of Sauron rode back to the Black Gate, let it be opened, and the forces of Sauron marched out. At the same time, more of Sauron's forces that had been hidden in the hills around the Black Gate came forth, thus surrounding and outnumbering the Men of the West by at least ten to one.<ref name=Battle/> Less than six thousand Men of the West were fielded.

===Battle===
Against Aragorn's army was arrayed Sauron's hordes of [[Orcs]], [[Trolls]], and barbarian [[Men|Mannish]] allies such as the [[Easterlings]] and [[Haradrim]]. An exact count is not given of the number of Sauron's forces, and though they numbered in the tens of thousands at least, the battle is said to not have been quite as large as the preceding [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. Sauron "had taken the proffered bait in jaws of steel", and the dismayed soldiers of the West were trapped. Aragorn arranged his men in a circular formation around two hills in front of the Morannon, with the best soldiers of the West arranged in the front where the assault would be at its most bitter.

The slag pools near the hills proved a hindrance for many of Sauron's forces, but trolls easily passed through the pools and crashed into the hosts of the West, bashing through them as smiths hewing hot iron. Many of the Orcs and Men were unable to climb up to face the Western host, and instead shot arrows and projectiles at them. During the fighting, [[Beregond]] was wounded by a Troll-chief, and as it reached its claws out for him [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] drove the blade of [[Westernesse]] through the creature before it could slay his comrade.

During the course of the battle, the eight remaining [[Nazgûl]] attacked the army of the West. The [[Eagles]] of the [[Misty Mountains]], led by [[Gwaihir]] the Windlord, arrived and attacked the Ringwraiths. The main host of Mordor managed to reach that of the West's, and despair was set among them. The Orcs laughed cruelly as they smashed against the Western forces, which began to dwindle, and the Ringwraiths overhead filled them with terror.<ref name=Battle>{{RK|V10}}</ref> At that moment, when all hope seemed lost, Frodo put on the One Ring and Sauron realized that Frodo was inside [[Mount Doom]]. The Nazgûl immediately left the battle to intercept Frodo.  The hosts of Mordor were suddenly without direction; the Orc laughter ceased, the Evil Men hesitated, and many knights of the West began to repel the attackers in a charge. Gandalf ordered them to halt, for the hour of doom was about to come. Indeed, [[Gollum]] bit the Ring off Frodo's finger and then fortuitously fell into the [[Cracks of Doom|Crack of Doom]], and Sauron's power was overthrown.<ref>{{RK|VI3}}</ref>

The Nazgûl had been flying over Mount Doom just as it underwent a gigantic volcanic eruption, and they were all destroyed in the firestorm. [[Barad-dûr]], the Black Gate, and the [[Towers of the Teeth]] collapsed to ruin. The Orcs and other creatures of Sauron were completely directionless with the Dark Lord's demise and fled mindlessly; some falling into pits, others outright killing themselves, and many fleeing. Many Easterlings and Haradrim fled as well or surrendered, though others banded together in their hatred and fought on stalwartly.<ref>{{RK|VI4}}</ref>

===Aftermath===
The desperate gambit of the West had succeeded, even as Frodo ultimately succumbed to the Ring. It was destroyed forever, and Sauron was disembodied permanently, his shadow fading away from Barad-dûr. Many surviving Orcs and Men retreated to the mountains or northward, where fighting against Sauron's remaining forces would continue for several weeks, notably at [[Dol Guldur]] in [[Mirkwood]] and at [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], but the power of the Dark Lord of Mordor was no more. The Western soldiers, weary and many injured, rested and healed before the host marched back to [[Minas Tirith]].<ref name=Great/>

Months later, the [[Battle of Bywater]] in [[the Shire]] against ruffians led by [[Saruman]], and the subsequent killing of Saruman and [[Gríma|Wormtongue]] on the very doorstep of [[Bag End]], ended the [[War of the Ring]].<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>

[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King - Battle of the Morannon.jpg|thumb|250px|The Battle of the Morannon - ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'']]
The Battle begins when [[Aragorn]] uses [[Andúril]] to behead the [[Mouth of Sauron]]. [[Sauron]] turns to the Black Gate, The Gate opens and out marches an army. While the army gets into position, Aragorn rallies the men of [[Rohan]] and [[Gondor]], foretelling the fall of [[Men]] but stating that that day was not the day of doom, and ends with, "Stand Men of the West!"

As Aragorn stands, he turns, and tells [[Gandalf]], [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], [[Legolas]], [[Gimli]], "For [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]." He then runs, followed by Merry and Pippin to into battle, along with the rest of the Fellowship and [[Army of the West|the Host of the West]], charging into the army at the Black Gate. As they fight, the Nazgûl appear on fell beasts. A moth appears to Gandalf, alerting him to the arrival of the [[Eagles]], which fight the [[fell beasts]] and [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]] riding them. As they retreat into [[Mordor]], Sauron learns that the [[One Ring]] is at [[Mount Doom|Orodruin]], and sends his Ringwraiths to retrieve the Ring at all costs. The Host of the West starts to be overrun by the force of Sauron, but as the One Ring perishes in Orodruin, [[Barad-dûr]], the [[Towers of the Teeth]] and the [[Black Gate]] fall into ruin, and the land in front, left and right of the Army sinks. The Orcs either fall into the sinkholes, or retreat from Mordor in despair, while the Host of the West stands in awe as the Realm of Sauron is ended.

In a deleted scene, when the army gets into position, Sauron himself appears in a form like he took in the films' version of the [[War of the Last Alliance]], and fights with Aragorn. However, as the ring is destroyed, the form fades, and it appears as if the Heir of [[Elendil]] had won against the Dark Lord in single combat. Parts of the footage shot for this battle were re-used for Aragorn's battle with a Troll.
