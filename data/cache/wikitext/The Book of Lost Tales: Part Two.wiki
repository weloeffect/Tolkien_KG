'''''The Book of Lost Tales: Part Two''''', published in [[1984]], is the second volume of [[Christopher Tolkien]]'s 12-volume book series, ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', in which he analyzes the unpublished manuscripts of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].

The book is the continuation of ''[[The Book of Lost Tales: Part One]]''. It includes the first forms of the tales of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]], [[Túrin]] and the [[Glaurung|Dragon]], the [[Nauglamír|Necklace of the Dwarves]], and the [[Fall of Gondolin]]. Each tale is followed by a commentary in the form of a short essay, together with the texts of associated poems, and contains extensive information on names and vocabulary in the earliest [[Elvish]] languages.

==Inscriptions==
There is an inscription in the [[Tengwar]] characters in the first pages of every ''History of Middle-earth'' volume, written by Christopher Tolkien and describing the contents of the book. The inscription in Book II reads:

:"''This is the second part of the Book of the Lost Tales of Elfinesse which [[Eriol|Eriol the Mariner]] learned from the Elves of Tol Eressëa, the Lonely Isle in the western ocean, and afterwards wrote in the [[Golden Book]] of [[Tavrobel]]. Herein are told the Tales of Beren and Tinúviel, of Turambar, of the Fall of Gondolin, and of the Necklace of the Dwarves.''"

==From the publisher==
{{blockquote|The second of a two-book set that contains the early myths and legends which led to the writing of Tolkien’s epic tale of war, The Silmarillion.<br>
This second part of The Book of Lost Tales includes the tale of Beren and Lúthien, Túrin and the Dragon, and the only full narratives of the Necklace of the Dwarves and the Fall of Gondolin, itself the finest and most exciting depiction of a battle that Tolkien ever wrote. Each tale is followed by a commentary in the form of a short essay, together with texts of associated poems, and contains extensive information on names and vocabulary in the earliest Elvish languages.}}
