'''Annon-in-Gelydh''' ([[Sindarin|S]]. "Gate of the Noldor") was the eastern entrance in the western hills of [[Dor-lómin]], that led to a subterranean river-bed and ended to the [[Cirith Ninniach]].

It was built by the [[Noldor]] of [[Turgon]] in the late [[First Age]]. After Turgon's departure to [[Gondolin]], the Gate was forgotten, but it was rediscovered and used centuries later by [[Tuor]] in his escape from the oppressed lands of [[Hithlum]] and finding his way into [[Nevrast]].<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Annon-in-Gelydh'' is a combination of ''[[annon]]'' ("gate"), the plural of the definite article ''[[i]]'', and the plural of ''[[Golodh]]'' ("Noldo").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-4089887271.html|articlename=S.
