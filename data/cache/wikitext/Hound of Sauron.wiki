The '''"Hound of Sauron"''' was the name given by [[Gandalf]] to one of the leaders of the [[Wargs]] that attacked the [[Fellowship]] in [[Hollin]].

==History==
On [[13 January]] {{TA|3019}}, after Gandalf confronted him, the wargs under him leapt upon the Fellowship with their leader. While the so called "Hound of [[Sauron]]" was killed, it is unclear who he was killed by as, during the attack, [[Aragorn]] stabbed “one huge leader”, while [[Boromir]] decapitated another leader, and “the heart of a great wolf-chieftain” was pierced by [[Legolas|Legolas's]] last arrow, kindled by fire.<ref>{{FR|Journey}}, pp. 297-9</ref>
