'''Éadgifu''' was the mother of [[Ælfwine]], from whom he has heard stories of the "islands of the [[West]]",<ref>{{LT2|VIb}}, note 29, pp. 330-1</ref> according to the early version of the [[legendarium]] in the text called ''[[Ælfwine of England]]'' from ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''.<ref name="Eng"/>

== History ==
Éadgifu was born in [[Lionesse]], a region of [[Luthany|Lúthien]], and was called as such by [[Déor (father of Ælfwine)|Déor]] her husband - even though that was not her original name.

She had an unquenchable longing for the sea while she dwelt in the inland city of [[Kortirion#Other versions of the legendarium|Kortirion]]<ref group="note">Kortirion was the [[Qenya|Elvish]] name of the town of [[wikipedia:Warwick|Warwick]].</ref><ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''30''', p. 310</ref> with Déor, a trait which was inherited by her son Ælfwine. The [[Elves]] of Lionesse, with whom she was friendly with, sent messengers to his birth, presumably to give their congratulations.

Éadgifu died during the siege of Kortirion by the [[Forodwaith (The Book of Lost Tales)|Forodwaith]] (i.e. [[wikipedia:Vikings|Vikings]]), and "her fair form lay unhonoured in [[Mindon Gwar]]".<ref name="Eng">{{LT2|VIb}}, pp. 313-4</ref>

== Etymology ==
The name ''Éadgifu'' is in [[Old English]], being comprised of ''éad'' ("blessedness") + ''gifu'' ("gift").<ref>{{LT2|VIb}}, p. 323</ref>
