'''InfuseR''' is the artist name of Athens-based guitarist and composer Manos Psarros. With over three decades in the Greek metal scene, he has performed with bands such as Leprosy, Obsecration, Empty Mirror, and DivUrge. His work combines symphonic and power-metal elements with complex storytelling, often drawing inspiration from high-fantasy literature.

In November 2025, InfuseR released his debut Tolkien-inspired solo concept album, ''A Tale of Tales'', which transforms the lore of Middle-earth into an immersive epic metal journey. Known for his technical skill and compositional versatility, he has collaborated with many notable Greek metal musicians and continues to explore ambitious solo projects.
