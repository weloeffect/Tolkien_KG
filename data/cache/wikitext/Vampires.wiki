'''Vampires''' were mysterious bat-like creatures in the service of [[Morgoth]] and of [[Sauron]]. The only vampire whose name is recorded in the annals of [[Arda]] is [[Sauron]]'s messenger, [[Thuringwethil]],<ref>{{LB|C12}}, line 3782</ref> but Sauron himself took the form of a vampire on at least one occasion, to flee [[Huan]].<ref>{{S|19}}</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''[[1989]]: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'' (''[[Dark Mage of Rhudaur]]''):'''
:Vampires are described as former [[Maiar|Maia]] patrons of normal bats, but corrupted by Morgoth and transformed into demons appearing as man-sized bats with "''the faces of hideous Men or Women''", having the ability to change shape.<ref>{{ICE|2012}}, p. 91</ref> A related creature is also envisioned, the ''Blood-wight'', which is an undead [[Men|Mannish]] shapechanger, draining blood from living beings.<ref>{{ICE|8013}}</ref>

'''[[2007]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:A new creature created for the game, the Merrevail (singular, Morroval) appear to be based on Tolkien's vampires. They are fearsome bat-winged women with sharp talons. The males of the species are the Mervyl (singular, Morvul).
