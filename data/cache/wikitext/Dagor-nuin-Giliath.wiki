The '''Dagor-nuin-Giliath''' ('''Battle-under-Stars''') was the second battle of the [[Wars of Beleriand]], it was given that name because the [[Moon]] had not risen yet. It was the first battle fought by the [[Noldor]] against the forces of [[Morgoth]]. The battle was preceded by the [[First Battle]].

==Background==
{{Main|First Battle}}
Morgoth had returned to [[Middle-earth]] after stealing the [[Silmarils]] and destroying the [[Two Trees of the Valar]]. He renewed his old fortress of [[Angband]] and attacked the Elves of [[Beleriand]] in what is known as the [[First Battle of Beleriand]]. He suffered heavy losses but managed to inflict heavy damage to the [[Sindar]] forcing them to retreat. The [[Falas]] were besieged by his host of Orcs. 

Meanwhile the [[Noldor]] following [[Fëanor]] were pursuing Morgoth for the theft of the Silmarils. They stopped when they reached the [[Helcaraxë]] and Fëanor debated on what to do as the narrow strait was dangerous to cross and the Noldor were growing restless. Later Fëanor chose to bring those he deemed loyal to him and sailed across the sea in secret with the boats he captured from the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë|battle of the Haven]] leaving [[Fingolfin]] and his followers behind.

==History==
===Prelude===
Fëanor and his followers returned to Middle-earth in {{YT|1497}},<ref name="MR">{{AA|157-163}}</ref> landing in [[Lammoth]]. There they burnt the ships at a place known now as [[Losgar]]. The host went up the [[Firth of Drengist]] and passed through where it pierced the [[Ered Lómin]] into [[Hithlum]] and encamped on the northern shore of Lake Mithrim.<ref name="S|Return"/>

The burning of the ships at Losgar were noticed by Fingolfin but also by the watchers of Morgoth. Morgoth sent a host of Orcs and [[werewolves]]<ref>{{GA|44}}</ref><ref group="note">In ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' it is not explicitly stated that there were werewolves in the host only in ''[[The Grey Annals]]''</ref> through the passes of the [[Ered Wethrin]] for a surprise attack hoping to destroy the Noldor before they could establish themselves.

===Battle===

The Elves were assailed at their camp before its defences were completed. The Orcs of Morgoth far outnumbered them, however the Noldor were still empowered with the Light of [[Valinor]] and quickly defeated them. The Orcs retreated across the [[Ered Wethrin|Mountains of Shadow]] into [[Ard-galen]] with the Noldor in hot pursuit.<ref name="S|Return"/> 

The forces of Morgoth that had been besieging the [[Havens of the Falas]] since the [[First Battle of Beleriand]] marched north to aid the fleeing Orcs, but a force led by [[Celegorm]] ambushed them near [[Eithel Sirion]] and pushed them back into the [[Fen of Serech]]. The battle lasted ten days and all but a few Orcs perished, and Fëanor in his wrath pursued even this small group.<ref name="S|Return"/>

The tables turned at the edge of [[Dor Daedeloth]], as Balrogs poured forth from [[Thangorodrim]]. Fëanor fought mightily, hewing his foe even after receiving several wounds from [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]], [[Lord of Balrogs]], until he was finally fatally wounded. Then the armies of [[Maedhros]] and three other of his sons in that moment came up with force to his aid, and the Balrogs fled back.<ref>{{GA|45}}</ref>

===Aftermath===
Fëanor was to be brought back to Mithrim but as they drew near the pass of [[Ered Wethrin]], Fëanor bade them to halt and he saw from afar the peaks of [[Thangorodrim]]. He cursed Angband thrice, but with the eyes of death, he knew that his Elves, unaided, would never throw down the dark towers. At the moment of his death the passing of his fiery spirit reduced his body to ashes.<ref name="S|Return"/>

Later [[Morgoth]] sent an embassy offering terms and feigning the surrender of a [[Silmaril]]. Maedhros, the eldest of the brothers also feigned to treat with Morgoth and appointed a place to meet. Both parties came in greater force than was agreed in the treaty, but unbeknownst to Maedhros, Morgoth sent an even greater force, and Maedhros' company was killed and the son of Fëanor captured. Maedhros was held hostage and Morgoth sent word to the Noldor to depart Beleriand and forsake their war. But the Sons of Fëanor were constrained by their [[Oath of Fëanor|oath]] and would not leave, so they withdrew to Hithlum and built a fortified camp. Maedhros was hung by the wrist of his right hand upon the face of a precipice of Thangorodrim.<ref name="S|Return"/>

==Etymology==
''Dagor-nuin-Giliath'' is [[Sindarin]] for "Battle under Stars",<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> containing the elements; ''[[dagor]]'' ("battle") + ''[[nu]]'' ("under") + ''[[gil]]'' (star) + ''[[-ath]]'' (collective plural suffix)

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the earlier writings the battle was first named Dagor-os-Giliath,<ref>{{SM|V2996}}</ref> but later changed to Dagor-nuin-Giliath, there was also another variant Dagor-nui-Ngiliath.<ref>{{LR|P2VI}}</ref> The battle was considered to be the First Battle of the [[Wars of Beleriand]] but this was later changed to include Morgoth's battle with the Sindar as part of the Wars so it was moved as the second battle.<ref>{{GA|36|note}}</ref>
