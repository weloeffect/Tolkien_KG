'''Otho Sackville-Baggins''' ({{TA|2910}} - {{TA|3012|n}}, died aged 102) was the husband of [[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins]] and the founder of the short-lived [[Sackville-Baggins Family]]. He was representative of the greedy and ill-mannered traits of his family.
==History==
Otho was the only known child of [[Longo Baggins]] and [[Camellia Sackville]].<ref name="Baggins">{{App|Baggins}}</ref> Through his mother, he was the head of the [[Sackville Family]], so he adopted the double surname out of custom.<ref name = "Letter214">{{LE|214}}</ref> Otho had [[pipe-weed]] plantations in the [[Southfarthing]].<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref> He married [[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins|Lobelia Bracegirdle]] with whom he had a son named [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins|Lotho]].

He was also second in line to patriarchy of the [[Baggins Family]], and would have been [[Bilbo Baggins]]' heir were it not for his adoption of his cousin [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]. Despite laws dictating that adoption of a member of a different family would not affect headship, Bilbo was of the opinion that Frodo was still deserving of the heirship, as he was a close relative of the same name. Otho objected, though it was ultimately decided that Frodo would become the family's official heir.<ref name = "Letter214"></ref> This did not sit well with Otho and his wife, as they both dearly wanted to live in [[Bag End]].<ref name="Party">{{FR|Party}}</ref>

Nevertheless, Otho was a guest at [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]]. After Bilbo had vanished in front of the crowd during the celebration, Otho and his wife departed in wrath. The [[23 September|next day]] he and Lobelia visited Bag End and demanded from [[Merry Brandybuck]] to see Frodo and insisted on seeing Bilbo's will, which, unfortunately for him, was valid and clear that Frodo was his legal heir.<ref name="Party"/> 

He did not live long enough to see Bag End as he died in {{SR|1412}}; it was six years later when Lobelia eventually did come into possession of Bag End, and moved in with her son.<ref>{{FR|Three}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Otho'' was meaningless in contemporary [[Hobbitish]] [[Westron]]. It represented an original name ''Otha''.<ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==

:Although he is not named as such until the programme credits, [[John Livesey]] plays Otho at Bilbo's 111th Birthday party.  He and Lobelia are given a brief exchange complaining about being part of one gross, and questioning what Frodo coming into his inheritance means. 

'''2001: {{fotree}}:'''
:[[Peter Corrigan]] plays Otho, though he does not have any lines.

'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:'''
