{{quote|I remember well the splendour of their banners," he said. "It recalled to me the glory of the [[Elder Days]] and the hosts of [[Beleriand]], so many great princes and captains were assembled. And yet not so many, nor so fair, as when [[Thangorodrim]] was broken, and the [[Elves]] deemed that evil was ended for ever, and it was not so.|[[Elrond]] in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', [[The Council of Elrond]]}}

The '''War of Wrath''', or the '''Great Battle''', was the final conflict in the [[Wars of Beleriand]] fought between the [[Host of the Valar|Host of the West]] and the forces of [[Morgoth]]. The devastation caused by the two sides clashing left [[Beleriand]] mostly destroyed and in the end most of the land sank beneath the waves. According to ''[[The Tale of Years (The War of the Jewels)|The Tale of Years]]'' it lasted for more than four decades ({{FA|545}} - {{FA|587|n}}).<ref name="Years">{{WJ|Years}}, p. 346</ref>

==Background==
After more than five centuries since the [[Return of the Noldor|rising of the sun]], [[Morgoth]] had become mighty in [[Middle-earth]]. He had defeated his enemies in the [[Wars of Beleriand|war]] and the majority of the [[Elves]] and [[Men]] of [[Beleriand]] were captured in droves and enslaved in the pits of [[Angband]]. The few that remained outside his grasp lived around the [[Mouths of Sirion]] or elsewhere in the woods and mountains.

Following the [[Fall of Gondolin]], the few [[Exiles of Gondolin|survivors]] protected by [[Ulmo]] had escaped the city, among them was [[Eärendil]] son of [[Tuor]] and [[Idril]]. He later married [[Elwing]], the daughter of [[Dior]] and [[Nimloth of Doriath|Nimloth]], and became the lord of the people living in the mouths of Sirion. With the aid of [[Círdan]] the shipwright they built the vessel [[Vingilótë]] and Eärendil sailed the sea hoping to find the [[Last Shore|last shore]] and beseech for aid.<ref name="WW" />

==History==
===Prelude===
[[File:Jenny Dolfen - The Vanyar Leave for War.jpg|200px|thumb|right|''The Vanyar Leave for War'' by [[Jenny Dolfen]]]]
While Eärendil was returning from his voyages, the [[sons of Fëanor]] [[Third Kinslaying|attacked the havens]] when Elwing refused to yield the [[Silmaril]] to them, and she cast herself into the ocean with the jewel. But Ulmo bore her up from the sea, and taking the form of a great white bird she reunited with Eärendil. Eärendil then sought for Valinor once more and, wearing the [[Silmaril]] on his brow, he traversed past the enchantments of the sea and came to [[Valinor]], the first of any living mortal to set foot there. He was brought before the [[Powers of Arda]] and he delivered the "errand of the [[Two Kindreds]]", begging the [[Valar]] for pardon for the [[Noldor]] and to deliver them from Morgoth.<ref name="WW" />

The [[Valar]] were moved by [[Eärendil]]'s plea and his prayer was granted. So, the host of the West prepared for battle, joined by some of the [[Maiar]], along with the [[Vanyar]] and [[Noldor]] that were in [[Valinor]], riding in the ships of the [[Falmari]]. Still bitter about the [[First Kinslaying]], the [[Teleri]] sent mariners to sail the ships, but did not participate in the war.<ref name="WW" />

Meanwhile, Eärendil and Elwing were given their judgement, as it was decreed by [[Mandos]] that no mortal should set foot in Aman and live. But Eärendil was also of Elf lineage, so [[Manwë]] forbade punishment for the two, as Eärendil came out of love of the Two Kindreds and Elwing came out of love for him. However, they would never return to Middle-earth again and would be given a choice of which kindred they should be counted among. Elwing chose to be counted among the [[Eldar]] and Eärendil chose alike. Then the Valar took Vingilótë, hallowed it, and bore it away to the edge of the world through the [[Door of Night]] with Eärendil at the helm and the Silmaril bound upon his brow.<ref name="WW" />

===Battle===
[[File:Elena Kukanova - War of Wrath.jpg|200px|thumb|left|''War of Wrath'' by [[Elena Kukanova]]]]
The host of Valinor landed in Beleriand in {{FA|545}}<ref name="Years" /> and the "whole power of the Throne of Morgoth" was gathered to fight against them. The arrayed armies of Morgoth were uncountable, and the mountains rang with the sound of the host of the West; the war raged across the entire North.<ref name="WW" />

Eventually, the forces of Morgoth were defeated in the field, the [[Balrogs]] were destroyed (save a few who fled and hid themselves in the depths of the earth) and the armies of the [[Orcs]] perished. While the [[Edain#The Three Houses|Three Houses of the Edain]] fought with the forces of Valinor, many other Men fought for Morgoth, which led to their scorn by the Elves. As the War carried into its final years Morgoth faced defeat, and so unleashed his last desperate assault, the winged [[Dragons]], which had never been seen in Middle-earth before. The greatest of these dragons was [[Ancalagon|Ancalagon the Black]]. The forces of the West were taken by surprise and overcome by the devastation the dragons wrought, and were driven back across the region. The skies erupted with lightning and flame at the dragons' arrival, and Morgoth's hosts repulsed the hosts of the Valar.<ref name="WW" />
[[File:Alan Lee - Ruin of Angband.jpg|200px|thumb|''Ruin of Angband'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]
As the situation grew dire for Morgoth's enemies, [[Eärendil]] came with his sky-ship [[Vingilótë]], along with [[Thorondor]] and flocks of great [[Eagles|birds]], and they fought the dragons. After a battle in the skies lasting a full day, Eärendil slew Ancalagon, and in his fall Ancalagon broke the towers of [[Thangorodrim]]. With Ancalagon slain, morale was renewed, and the host of the Valar retook the ground that had been lost. They destroyed the pits of Morgoth and descended into Angband.<ref name="WW" />

Morgoth fled to the deepest dungeons of Angband, where he was caught. Rather than challenge his foes, he asked for peace and parley, but his feet were hewn from under him and Morgoth fell upon the floor. He was bound with his old chain Angainor; the two Silmarils still in his possession were taken and given to the Maia [[Eönwë]] to be guarded. In the end, the Valar thrust him "through the [[Door of Night]], beyond the [[Walls of the World]], into the [[The Void|Timeless Void]]".<ref name="WW" />

===Aftermath===
Countless slaves were freed from Angband after Morgoth's defeat. The world had changed greatly, for the fury of both sides in the war had wreaked havoc on much of the land. The northern areas were torn asunder, rivers formed or destroyed, mountains and hills changed.<ref name="WW" /> The wreckage of the war was immense; most of the land west of the [[Ered Luin]] sank beneath the waves, and Beleriand was destroyed. The sea broke through the Ered Luin and formed the [[Gulf of Lhûn]].<ref name="RP" />
[[File:John Howe - The Door of Night.jpg|200px|thumb|left|''The Doors of Night'' by [[John Howe]]]]
[[Eönwë]], the herald of [[Manwë]], summoned all the Elves of Beleriand to depart [[Middle-earth]] and go to Valinor. Most of the Noldor and Sindar did so, but a number of them did not and instead went east, such as [[Galadriel]] and [[Gil-galad]]. Maedhros and Maglor sent word to Eönwë to yield the Silmarils to them, but they received the reply that they no longer had any right to the Silmarils due to the deeds wrought pursuing their [[Oath of Fëanor|oath]]. Despite this, the two sons of Fëanor stole the jewels from Eönwë's camp. But the Silmarils burnt their hands. So great was the pain that Maedhros cast himself and the Silmaril into a chasm of fire and Maglor cast his jewel into the sea; the Silmarils found their homes in the high heavens, earth, and deep waters.<ref name="WW" />

The [[Edain]] were rewarded for fighting with the Valar in the war and were given a new land to dwell in that was neither part of Middle-earth nor of Valinor: the land was called [[Andor]], the Land of Gift, but the Edain named it [[Elenna]] and later [[Númenórë]].<ref>{{S|IV}}</ref> The Men that fought with Morgoth fled east.<ref name="RP">{{S|V}}</ref>
[[File:Šárka Škorpíková - I hate him.jpg|200px|thumb|''I hate him'' by [[:Category:Images by Šárka Škorpíková|Šárka Škorpíková]]]]
The Dwarven cities [[Nogrod]] and [[Belegost]] were ruined when the Ered Luin were broken, forcing their populaces to flee.<ref>{{App|A3}}</ref>

The surviving servants of Morgoth fled east. [[Sauron]], the former chief lieutenant of Morgoth, came out to sue for Eönwë's pardon. He was ordered to return to [[Valinor]] to receive judgement; instead he fled and hid back in [[Middle-earth]]. Morgoth himself remains in the Void, brooding in his hatred. According to legend and prophecy, he will one day break through the Doors of Night and come upon Arda in great wrath, laying it to waste. In this apocalyptic battle, the [[Dagor Dagorath]], it is said that he will be slain forever, and afterward the world will be remade in perfect form by [[Eru]].<ref name="WW" /><ref name="RP" />

==Other versions of the legendarium==
The first fragments of what would be the War of Wrath appear in notes and outlines related to ''[[The Tale of Eärendel]]'', a story that was never written by Tolkien. In the ''[[Lost Tales]]'' version there is no mention of Eärendel's plea to the Valar on behalf of the [[Two Kindreds]], and the notes suggest that his voyage to [[Valinor]] was in vain. Instead, the Elves of Valinor receive tidings from the birds of Gondolin about its [[Fall of Gondolin|fall]]. The news angers the Elves and they march to the [[Great Lands]] against the will of the Valar, who are opposed to the Elves intervening.<ref>{{LT2|V}}</ref>

''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and its early drafts cover the War of Wrath.<ref>{{SM|Q17II}}</ref> As Tolkien was developing the story he also produced another set of texts – the ''Annals'' – which at first were used as a supportive document to help put a chronological structure to the story, but later grew in detail such that it became another "proper" account of the Silmarillion akin to the [[quenta]]s. The ''[[Annals of Beleriand]]'' cover the history of the Elves in Beleriand and introduce new elements to the battle that are absent in the other texts.

The [[Battle of Eglarest|Battle of Eldorest]] was the opening battle of the conflict.<ref name="AB1">{{SM|7I}}, p. 309</ref> Eldorest (known as [[Eglarest]] in ''The Silmarillion'') was the haven city of [[Círdan]] which was laid to ruin by Morgoth's armies after the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]].<ref>{{S|20}}</ref> In the battle [[Ingwion|Ingwiel]] (or Ingwil) – leader of the Light-elves, later [[Vanyar]] – makes landing with his Elves and defeats the Orcs on the shore.<ref name="AB2">{{LR|AB}}, p. 144</ref>

In the later ''[[The Later Annals of Beleriand|Annals of Beleriand]]'' there is a new element, where the host of Fiönwë and Morgoth contest the river [[Sirion]]. Both hosts encamp on either side of the river<ref name="AB1" /> and fight bitterly for control of the [[Pass of Sirion|passage]]. This may explain why the conflict was prolonged as it also states that the war lasted "fifty years from the landing of Fiönwë".<ref name="AB2" /> Sirion was a mighty river that ran through Beleriand and was wide and swift with few crossings. The most direct route for the host of Valinor to take to Angband would be through the [[Pass of Sirion]], as it was accessible enough for large armies to pass, hence why it was a strategic location to control. The camp of Fiönwë is likely a reintroduced element from the ''Lost Tales'', where the Elves of [[Kôr]] encamp in the Land of Willows or [[Tasarinan]] which is [[Nan-tathren]] in ''The Silmarillion''.<ref name="LTEA">{{LT2|VI}}, p. 278</ref>

In ''The Silmarillion'', Morgoth did not personally involve himself in the conflict and never left Angband, but in the ''Annals of Beleriand'' he indeed came forth from Angband,<ref name="AB2" /> although it is unclear if Morgoth fought or just commanded his armies from afar. The only other mentioned Vala to have taken part in the conflict was [[Tulkas]] in the ''Lost Tales'', where he defeated Melko in the [[Pools of Twilight]] in what is known as the battle of the Silent Pools.<ref name="LTEA" />

The conflict had a number of different names in the drafts. It was known as the '''Terrible Battle''' or '''Last Battle''',<ref>{{SM|2}}, p. 39</ref> the '''Battle Terrible''', or '''Battle of Wrath and Thunder'''.<ref>{{SM|Q18II}}, p. 157</ref>

In a list of names from the 1930s the battle was referred to as '''Dagor Delothrin''' ("Terrible Battle"), referencing [[The Earliest Annals of Beleriand]]. The name is not, however, explicitly given in the annals, and seems to not be mentioned anywhere else.<ref>{{LR|A2}}, p. 405</ref>

According to a prophecy of [[Andreth]], a [[Wise-woman]] of the [[House of Bëor]], [[Túrin Turambar]] would return from the [[Doom of Men|Dead]] and slay Ancalagon in the War of Wrath.<ref>{{PM|Ros}}, Note 17, pp. 374-375</ref> For more information, see [[Dagor Dagorath#Mannish legend|the Mannish legend of the Dagor Dagorath]].
