'''Bill Ferny''' was a man of [[Bree]], known to be an associate of the [[Nazgûl]] and later, a ruffian of the [[Ruffians|Chief's Men]].

==Description==
Descriptions of Ferny's appearance are limited to his being a "swarthy Bree-lander"<ref name="FRI9">{{FR|I9}}</ref> or a "sneery swarthy fellow."<ref>{{FR|Strider}}</ref>

==History==
Bill Ferny lived in the last house of Bree, and was an opportunistic backstabber who was little liked by respectable folk of the town. He also served as a spy for the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]], and relayed information about [[Shire-hobbits]] to them.

On [[September 29]]th of {{TA|3018|n}}, Ferny and his [[Squint-eyed southerner|associate]] were at [[The Prancing Pony]] when the two of them saw [[Mr. Underhill]] vanish into thin air. They reported the information to the Black Riders.<ref name="UT10">{{UT|10}}, "Concerning Gandalf, Saruman, and the Shire"</ref>

After reporting to the Black Riders, Ferny and his allies went to the inn's stables and set all mounts loose. There was only one pony left in all of Bree: [[Bill the Pony|Bill's mistreated one]]. He sold him for twelve [[silver pennies]] to [[Aragorn|Strider]] and the [[Travellers|Hobbits]]. As a parting gift, [[Samwise Gamgee]] threw an [[apples|apple]] at his head.<ref>{{FR|Strider}}</ref>

Ferny's associate was spotted inside his house when the company set out to [[Weathertop]].<ref name="FRI11">{{FR|I11}}</ref>

After the [[Ruffians]] among the [[Southerners]] were kicked out of Bree, it was believed by [[Barliman Butterbur]] that Bill Ferny and [[Harry Goatleaf]] opened the gates to let them in since the two of them sided with Ruffians in the battle that followed.<ref>{{RK|Homeward}}</ref> After fleeing Bree with the Ruffians, he threw in his lot with the [[Sharkey's Men|Men]] serving [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]] in the [[Shire]]. He guarded the outer gate at the [[Brandywine Bridge]] as the Chief's Big Man and his command over the local [[Shirriffs]] was hard. When the four [[Travellers]] returned to the Shire, he attempted to threaten them, but was threatened by [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] in turn, and as such he fled into the night after giving him the gate key, though not until after his old pony had kicked him in his back. He was never heard of again.<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Bill'' is a name Tolkien used to represent the [[Westron]] name '''Bil''', which was a short for names as ''Arambil'', ''Bildad'' and ''Bilcuzal'', all of unknown meaning.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}</ref> ''Ferny'' is a reference to the [[wikipedia:Fern|plant]], as many surnames of [[Bree]] were botanical in nature.<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 757</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In an earlier draft of [[The Scouring of the Shire]], it is Frodo who threatens Ferny rather than Merry. Later, Sam compares [[Ted Sandyman]] to Ferny.<ref>{{SD|Shire}}, pp. 80, 88-9</ref>
