'''Bairanax''' the “Bear-hunter” was a [[Cold-drake]] in the [[Grey Mountains]]. He was invented by [[Iron Crown Enterprises]] for ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]''. He has brownish-red scales and measures fifty-five feet in length.

When he escaped the doom of Angband as a young dragon, a North Bear almost killed him. This instilled a deep hatred of bears into the dragon. Likewise, [[Northmen|Northman]] Bear-cults view him as their ancient enemy. Beyond Bears, Bairanax has a rivalry with the dragon [[Lomaw]].

The lair of Bairanax was situated in the caves at Ovir Hollow, surrounded by a flower-filled moat, somewhere in the southern Grey Mountains.<ref name=creatures>{{ICE|2012}}, pp. 106-107</ref>
