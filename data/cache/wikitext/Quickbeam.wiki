'''Quickbeam''', or in [[Sindarin]] '''Bregalad''', was one of the younger [[Ents]] of [[Fangorn Forest]] belonging to the people of [[Skinbark]]. His name was given because of his uncharacteristic hastiness.  
==History==
The [[rowans|rowan]]-trees in his keeping (among them [[Carnimírië]], [[Lassemista]], and [[Orofarnë]]) suffered greatly at the hands of [[Saruman]]'s [[Orcs]], so he was the first ent to make his mind up at the [[Entmoot]]. He sheltered, in his [[Ent-houses|home]], the two [[hobbits]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] while the other ents made up their minds at the Entmoot.<ref name=tt482/> He played a great part in the Ents' resulting [[Battle of Isengard|attack]] on [[Isengard]] and stopped Saruman when he tried to escape.<ref name=Flotsam>{{TT|Flotsam}}, p. 568</ref> He was among the Ents guarding Orthanc after the Battle of Isengard.<ref>{{RK|Partings}}, p. 980</ref>
==Characteristics==
Quickbeam was considered very hasty or at least "nearest thing among us to a hasty Ent" according to Treebeard. Part of this hastiness was because he had seen first-hand the actions of Saruman as his home was ravaged by Orcs. Despite this, he was joyous, singing as he walked and laughing easily.<ref name=tt482/> He was described by Pippin as gentle but with a fierce hatred towards Saruman for his actions towards his people.<ref name=Flotsam/>

Quickbeam appeared to be one of the younger ents. His hair was smooth, his lips ruddy and his hair green. He was tall but could bend and sway in the wind like a slender tree. His voice was resonant and higher and clearer than Treebeard's.<ref name=tt482>{{TT|Treebeard}}, pp. 482-4</ref>
== Etymology ==
The name ''Quickbeam'' was given to him because he was hasty for an Ent.<ref name=tt482/> His Sindarin name, ''Bregalad'', means "quick (lively) tree", derived from  *''[[BERÉK|breg]]-'' having to do with "violence, suddenness" and ''[[galadh]]'', "tree".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 82</ref>

Quickbeam (Old English ''Cwicbeám'') and Quicken are actual English names of the [[Rowans|rowan]] or mountain [[Ashes|ash]], ''Sorbus aucuparia.'' It was not coincidental that "rowan" is mentioned in Quickbeam's song.<ref name="nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 762</ref>
