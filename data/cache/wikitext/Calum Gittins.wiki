'''Calum Gittins''' ([[16 July|July 16]], [[1986]]) is the son of [[Philippa Boyens]]. He played [[Haleth (film character)|Haleth]], the movie-only son of [[Háma]], in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''. 

His lines were later dubbed, as his own voice had matured too much in the time between initial shooting and pick-ups.
