During the [[War of the Ring]] he stayed out of the war for most of the conflict, but he followed his brother to the [[Battle of the Morannon]], where he and his vassals helped turn the tide.

After the Ring was destroyed, Landroval, Gwaihir and [[Meneldor]], flew into [[Mordor]] to retrieve [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] from the ruins of [[Mount Doom]].<ref>{{RK|Cormallen}}, pp. 948, 950</ref>
