{{Quote|I am great headman, Ghân-buri-Ghân. I count many things: stars in sky, leaves on trees, men in the dark. You have a score of scores counted ten times and five. They have more. Big fight, and who will win? And many more walk round walls of Stone-houses.|Ghân-buri-Ghân introducing himself to King Théoden<ref name="Ride">{{RK|V5}}, pp. 830-5</ref>}}

'''Ghân-buri-Ghân''' was the great headman of the [[Drúedain]] who inhabited [[Drúadan Forest]] in the late [[Third Age]].<ref name="Ride" />

==History==
Ghân-buri-Ghân was the son of [[Ghân]]<ref name="Parma">{{PE|17}}, entry '''Ghân buri Ghân''', p. 99</ref> with whom he shared his name, and became the great headman of his people.<ref name="Ride" />
[[File:The Brothers Hildebrandt - Ghân-buri-Ghân.png|thumb|240px|left|"Ghân-buri-Ghân" by [[The Brothers Hildebrandt]]]]
On [[13 March]] {{TA|3019}} during the [[War of the Ring]], Ghân-buri-Ghân met with [[King of Rohan|King]] [[Théoden]] and the [[Rohirrim]].<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> The great headman of the [[Woses]] revealed the existence of the [[Gondrant]]<ref>{{NM|P3xvii}}, footnote 12, p. 363</ref>, an old route running through the [[Stonewain Valley]] from the quarries beneath [[Min-Rimmon]] to [[Minas Anor]].<ref name="Parma 17">{{PE|17}}, p. 28 (entry "Stonewain Valley"</ref> During the next day, Ghân-buri-Ghân guided the [[Rohirrim]] along the road to avoid the [[Orcs]] blocking the main road so they could reach Minas Tirith. This allowed the Rohirrim to arrive in time to fight the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. In return, Théoden promised that the people of [[Rohan]] would no longer trouble the Drúedain and would drive away the ''[[Gorgûn]]'' that hunted them.<ref name="Ride" />

Following the War of the Ring, [[Aragorn]], as [[High King of the Dúnedain|High King]] of the [[Reunited Kingdom]], issued the decree that the Drúadan Forest belonged to only Ghân-buri-Ghân and his people, and that no one else was allowed to enter the forest without their permission.<ref>{{RK|Partings}}, p. 976</ref>

==Etymology==
''Ghân-buri-Ghân'' means "Ghân son of Ghân" in the [[Drúadan language|language]] of the Drúedain. It is a compound of the name ''[[Ghân]]'', the element ''[[buri]]'' ("son of") and the name ''Ghân''.<ref name="Parma" />

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In all the earlier drafts of the chapter "[[The Ride of the Rohirrim]]", Ghân-buri-Ghân remained mostly the same as he is in the published text. Only his dialogue and descriptions concerning the road to Minas Tirith varied heavily in drafts.<ref>{{WR|VII}}, pp. 351-2</ref> In this draft, some of his physical appearance is omitted.<ref>{{WR|VII}}, Notes, p. 356 (note 14)</ref>

In an early draft of the chapter "[[The Steward and the King]]", Ghân-buri-Ghân visits [[Minas Tirith]] with two headmen "clad in garments of green leaves" where they bow before King Elesser, who grants "them the Forest of Druadan".<ref>{{SD|VI}}, p. 56</ref> While writing an early draft of the chapter "[[Many Partings]]", Tolkien decided to move Aragorn's interaction with Ghân-buri-Ghân from the previous chapter.<ref name="early">{{SD|VII}}, pp. 61-2</ref> In the draft, Ghân-buri-Ghân "stood by the eaves of the trees, and did them homage as they passed".<ref name="early" /> While this omits Aragorn giving them the forest, Tolkien later developed this version, re-introducing elements from the first version. In this draft, '''Ghân of the Wild Woods''' approaches Aragorn with "two of his headmen…clad all in garments of green leaves" and bow to him. After Aragorn grants them possession of the forest, they bow once more before leaving. This version was immediately replaced by a version almost resembling the published text.<ref>{{SD|VII}}, pp. 67-8</ref>
