'''''The Adventures of Tom Bombadil and Other Verses from the Red Book''''' is a [[1962]] collection of poetry by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. The book contains 16 poems, two of which feature [[Tom Bombadil]], the rest of the poems are an assortment of [[Wikipedia:bestiary|bestiary]] verse and [[Wikipedia:fairy tale|fairy tale]] rhyme. Three of the poems appear in ''The Lord of the Rings'' as well. The book was originally illustrated by [[Pauline Baynes]].

==Contents==
The book's "[[Preface]]" presents the poems as a translation from the ''[[Red Book of Westmarch]]'', and gives some background information that is not found elsewhere: e.g. the name of the tower at [[Dol Amroth]] and the names of the [[Rivers of Gondor|Seven Rivers]] of [[Gondor]]. The poems carry some fictional backstory, linking them to [[Hobbit]] folklore; they are all supposedly works that Hobbits enjoyed and were preserved in the margins of the Red Book, with several of them being attributed to [[Bilbo Baggins]] and [[Sam Gamgee]].<ref>{{HM|A}}Richard C. West, ''The Adventures of Tom Bombadil'' (Review), [[Tolkien Studies: Volume 12]]</ref>

* I. ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil (poem)|The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]''
* II. ''[[Bombadil Goes Boating]]''
* III ''[[Errantry]]''
* IV. ''[[Princess Mee]]''
* V. ''[[The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late]]''
* VI. ''[[The Man in the Moon Came Down Too Soon]]''
* VII. ''[[The Stone Troll]]''
* VIII. ''[[Perry-the-Winkle]]''
* IX. ''[[The Mewlips]]''
* X. ''[[Oliphaunt (poem)|Oliphaunt]]''
* XI. ''[[Fastitocalon (poem)|Fastitocalon]]''
* XII. ''[[Cat (poem)|Cat]]''
* XIII. ''[[Shadow-Bride]]''
* XIV. ''[[The Hoard]]''
* XV. ''[[The Sea-Bell]]''
* XVI. ''[[The Last Ship]]''

The order of the poems form a thematical progress: two poems with the titular character, two "[[faerie]]" poems, two with the [[Man in the Moon]], two with [[Trolls]]; three "bestiary", and four "atmospheric/emotional". ''The Mewlips'' doesn't fit to a category, and placed in the middle as a divider.

*Poems proposed but eventually omitted:
**''[[The Trees of Kortirion]]'' and ''[[The Little House of Lost Play: Mar Vanwa Tyaliéva|You and Me]]'', later published in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales: Part One]]''
**''[[The Dragon's Visit]]'', later published in the revised edition of ''[[The Annotated Hobbit]]''

*Poems added in the 2014 extended edition:
**''[[Once upon a Time]]'', a poem related to Tom Bombadil.
**''[[An Evening in Tavrobel]]'', recounting an evening in [[Tavrobel]], a place in [[Tol Eressëa]] in the early version of the legendarium.

==Background==
[[Tom Bombadil]] was a figure in [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s mind that appeared in his writings at various times, including a [[1937]] poem; eventually he became a [[canon]]ical part of the [[Legendarium]] while Tolkien was writing ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

Tolkien's aunt [[Jane Neave]] enjoyed the figure of Tom in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' and asked him if he could make a book out of him that would make an affordable [[Christmas]] present. As Tom was a vague, deliberately [[Tom Bombadil/Nature|unexplained figure]], Tolkien didn't feel that anything more could be told about him, but thought that his 1937 poem could be made into an illustrated booklet,<ref>''[[Bilbo's Last Song (at the Grey Havens)|Bilbo's Last Song]]'' was published years later in such a format.</ref> with [[Pauline Baynes]] in his mind. [[Rayner Unwin]] suggested to collect more poems with it so as to be a more publishable book. Tolkien then researched some older, half-forgotten poems (the value of which he doubted)<ref name=chron>{{CG|C}}</ref><ref>{{L|233}}</ref> and started a laborious process to rediscover, rub up, improve and re-write them; something which, as he wrote to his aunt, he greatly enjoyed.<ref>{{L|234}}</ref>

Tolkien thought (and Baynes agreed) that the poems didn't fit together as a collection.<ref name=chron/> Part of Tolkien's re-writing attempted to make them fit with each other and into [[Hobbit]]-lore; he decided to include a Foreword that would make this connection, and wrote [[Bombadil Goes Boating|a second poem with Tom]] in order to fit him better into the world of [[the Shire]] and Hobbits.<ref>{{L|237}}</ref>

;Illustrations
Despite Baynes suggested that his poems were rather "felt", Tolkien insisted that his images were definite, clear and precise.<ref>{{L|235}}</ref> He instructed Baynes that the illustrations "shouldn't be comical". Then she collaborated with art editor Ronald Eames, and finished six illustrations by August [[1962]]. Though there were some criticism from Tolkien to Baynes' work, in the end, Tolkien credited for a large part Baynes for the commercial success of the book.

==Extended edition==
An extended edition was published in [[2014]], edited by [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]]. This edition includes: an introduction by the editors, earlier versions of 13 poems with textual notes, a later 'Bombodil' poem ''[[Once upon a Time]]'', a previously unpublished text ''The Bumpus'', the predecessor of ''Perry-the-Winkle'', and the complete fragment of a prose story featuring Tom Bombadil.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Wayne G.
