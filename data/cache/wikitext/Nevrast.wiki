The land of '''Nevrast''' lay on the coast of the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] in [[Middle-earth]] in the [[First Age]]. The name meant ''Hither Shore'' in [[Sindarin]] as opposed to the ''Distant Shore'' of [[Aman]], and the name was originally applied to all the shores of [[Beleriand]]. Some people considered the land of Nevrast to be part of Beleriand, while others considered it part of [[Hithlum]].<ref name=hithlum>{{S|14}}, p. 112</ref>

Nevrast was sheltered by mountains that separated it from Hithlum proper, so its weather was more like the lands of [[West Beleriand]] than the lands to its northeast. It received ample rains from the sea which drained into the great mere of [[Linaewen]] in the midst of the land, for Nevrast was enclosed by mountains with no outward flowing rivers.<ref name="Bel">{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

==History==
Nevrast was the first part of Beleriand the [[Noldor]] settled, but it had been previously inhabited by [[Sindar]]. Nevrast's population was soon very mixed, far more so than any other region of Beleriand.

Nevrast was the centre of an [[Elves|Elven]] kingdom of [[Turgon]] for about a century until ca. {{FA|116}}, when the people began their trek to [[Gondolin]].<ref>{{S|Noldor}}</ref> Turgon's capital (and it seems the only city of Nevrast) was [[Vinyamar]].<ref name="Bel"/> The land was not permanently inhabited after that, and indeed was utterly abandoned until [[Tuor]] came there, guided by [[Ulmo]].<ref>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==

An early, rejected form of the name ''Nevrast'' was ''Nivrost'' ("West Vale" or "West-dales").<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, p. 256</ref><ref>{{WJ|Index}}</ref><ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 29</ref>
