==Summary==
Tolkien writes that he had a somewhat boring day drilling and attending classes (as part of the Officer's Training Corps). However, at a meeting of an Essasy Club: "''There was a bad paper but an interesting discussion. It was also composition meeting and I read '[[Éalá Éarendel Engla Beorhtast|Earendel]]' which was well criticised.''[[Category:Letters to Edith Tolkien]]
