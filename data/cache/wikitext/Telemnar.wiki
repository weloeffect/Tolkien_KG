}}'''Telemnar''', {{TA|1516}}<ref name="Elendil">{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> - {{TA|1636}},<ref name="South">{{App|South}}</ref> was the twenty-sixth [[King of Gondor]].

==History==
Telemnar came to the throne unexpectedly when his father [[Minardil]] was killed in a surprise raid by [[Corsairs of Umbar]].  In response, he began outfitting a fleet to reduce the [[Umbar|Haven of Umbar]], but this work was halted when the [[Great Plague]] struck his realm.<ref name="Elendil" />  The King and all his children died in {{TA|1636}},<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> as did a large number of the people of [[Gondor]].  The [[White Tree of Gondor#Second White Tree|White Tree]] withered and died, [[Osgiliath]] was partially deserted and began to fall into ruin, and the watch on [[Mordor]] ceased.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

With Telemnar and all his heirs deceased, the Kingship passed on to his nephew [[Tarondor (King of Gondor)|Tarondor]], the son of Telemnar's younger brother [[Minastan]].<ref name="South" />

==Etymology==
''Telemnar'' is [[Quenya]]. Its meaning is not glossed, but as Paul Strack explains, it seems to mean "Silver Fire" and be a compound of an assimilated form [[telep]] of [[telpë]] ("silver") and the element [[nár (Quenya)|nár]] ("fire").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-185503219.html|articlename=Q.
