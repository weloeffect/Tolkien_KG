'''Cardolan''' was a breakaway realm of the [[Dúnedain]] kingdom of [[Arnor]]. After the death of Arnor's King [[Eärendur (King of Arnor)|Eärendur]], his sons divided the realm into the kingdoms of [[Arthedain]], [[Rhudaur]] and Cardolan.

==Description==
The borders of Cardolan were the river [[Baranduin|Brandywine]] from the [[Brandywine Bridge]] down to the [[Belegaer|Sea]] in the west, the river [[Mitheithel|Hoarwell]] from the [[Last Bridge]] down to the river [[Gwathló]] and down to the Sea in the east, the [[East Road|Great East Road]] in the north and the coast of [[Minhiriath]] from the mouth of the Brandywine to the mouth of the Gwathló in the south. The possession of the [[Weather Hills]] and the land westwards towards Bree was disputed between Cardolan, [[Rhudaur]] and [[Arthedain]].<ref name="Eriador">{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', p. 1039</ref> Notable features within Cardolan were the [[Old Forest]], the [[Barrow-downs]], the [[South Downs]], the [[Greenway]] and the deep dike with a steep wall on the further side at the northern boundary of Cardolan<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 148</ref> just to the south of the Great East Road.<ref>{{FR|Barrow}}, pp. 146</ref><ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>

==History==
In {{TA|861}} Arnor's tenth King, Eärendur, died.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 861, p. 1085</ref> Due to dissensions between his sons the realm was split into [[Arthedain]], [[Rhudaur]] and Cardolan. There was often strife among the three kingdoms, because Rhudaur and Cardolan desired to possess the Weather Hills and the land westwards towards Bree, especially [[Weathertop]], because the tower on it contained the most important ''[[Amon Sûl-stone|Palantír]]'' of the North and the other two palantíri of the North were also held by Arthedain.<ref name="Eriador" /> While the line of [[Isildur]] continued in Arthedain, it soon failed in Rhudaur and Cardolan.<ref name="Eriador" />
 
In {{TA|1050|n}} the [[Harfoots]] came into Eriador<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1050, p. 1085</ref> and in {{TA|1150|n}} they were joined by the [[Fallohides]].<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1150, p. 1085</ref> It is possible that some of these [[Hobbits]] settled in Cardolan.

===War with Angmar=== 
Around {{TA|1272|n}}<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> [[Orcs]] began to trouble the region<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> and around {{TA|1300}}, the [[Witch-king]] founded the kingdom of [[Angmar]] north of the [[Ettenmoors]]. This event caused many Hobbits to move to [[Bree]].<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year ''c.'' 1300, p. 1086</ref>
 
[[Argeleb I]] of Arthedain claimed lordship over all of former Arnor, because no descendants of Isildur remained in Cardolan and Rhudaur. Rhudaur resisted this claim and made a secret league with Angmar.<ref name="Eriador" /> It is possible that Cardolan accepted Arthedain’s claim and that the vassal ruler of Cardolan had the title prince of Cardolan.<ref group="note">In the entry for the year 1356 of manuscript T4 of {{PM|Third}} king Argeleb is slain in battle with Cardolan and Rhudaur and both realms resist his claim to overlordship, but the section ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'' in {{App|Eriador}} only mentions that his claim was resisted by Rhudaur and that he was slain in battle with Rhudaur and Angmar without mentioning that Cardolan resisted the claim or that he died in battle with Cardolan. In addition Cardolan later helps Arthedain in the wars with Rhudaur and Angmar. Furthermore, a [[Last prince of Cardolan|prince]] of Cardolan, rather than a king of Cardolan is mentioned later.</ref> Argeleb I fell in battle with Rhudaur and Angmar in {{TA|1356|n}}.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1356, p. 1086</ref> Cardolan, and [[Lindon]], assisted his son, [[Arveleg I]], to avenge his father by pushing the enemy from the Weather Hills. For many years Arthedain and Cardolan held a frontier along the Hills, the [[East Road]] and the lower [[Hoarwell]].<ref name="Eriador" />
 
However, in {{TA|1409}} a great host issued from Angmar and invaded Cardolan, took Weathertop and destroyed the tower of Amon Sûl. The [[last prince of Cardolan]] was interred in the Barrow-downs that year. Some say that he was interred in the tomb where [[Frodo Baggins]] was trapped during the [[War of the Ring]].<ref name="ReferenceA">{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', p. 1041</ref> It is likely that [[Merry]] saw the last memories of the last prince of Cardolan in his dreams in the tomb,<ref>{{HM|RC}}, "Fog on the Barrow-downs", pp. 144-5; Index, 'Cardolan, [[Last prince of Cardolan|last prince of]]'</ref> because he mentioned an attack by the "men of [[Carn Dûm]]" and a spear in his heart.<ref>{{FR|Barrow}}, p. 143</ref> A remnant of the [[Dúnedain]] of Cardolan held out in the Barrow-downs and the [[Old Forest]].<ref name="ReferenceA" />

In {{TA|1636}}<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1636, p. 1086</ref> most of the people of Cardolan died from the [[Great Plague]], especially in Minhiriath. Angmar then sent [[Barrow-wights]] to infest and haunt the Barrow-downs.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> In {{TA|1851}} [[King of Arthedain]] [[Araval]] attempted to re-occupy Cardolan, but the [[Barrow-wights]] terrified anyone who attempted to dwell near the Barrow-downs.<ref>{{PM|Elendil}} manuscript C with corrections and expansions, The Northern Line of Arnor: the Isildurioni, 23. Araval, pp. 195, 209-210</ref>

===Legacy===
The region remained unpopulated even after the final fall of Arnor and destruction of Angmar ({{TA|1974|n}}.<ref>{{App|TA}} entry for the year 1974, p. 1086</ref>).

During the [[War of the Ring]] ({{TA|3018}}) the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] entered Cardolan around September 24. Their chief, the [[Witch-king]], moved to [[Andrath]] and visited the Barrow-downs, where he stayed for three days in order to rouse the Barrow-wights. According to the rare manuscript ''[[The Hunt for the Ring|The Hunt for the Ring: Time Scheme - Black Riders]]'', the [[Witch King]] empowered the Barrow-wights and slew the [[Ranger]]s in order to trap the [[Ring]]-bearer - a strategy that would almost work; he left on September 27.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, "Fog on the Barrow-downs", p. 145-6</ref><ref name="RC">{{HM|RC}}, "Flight to the Ford", p. 180</ref><ref>{{UT|Other}}</ref> 

Presumably the area remained deserted until the reestablishment of the northern kingdom under king [[Aragorn|Elessar]] at the end of the Third Age.

[[Tom Bombadil]] was seemingly involved (at least as a spectator) in the wars between Cardolan and Angmar, although it is unknown to what extent. After freeing the hobbits from the barrow, he took a brooch for Goldberry and showed grief discovering it belonged to a “fair” woman he met long ago, usually identified with the wife of the [[last prince of Cardolan]].<ref>{{HM|RC}}, "Fog on the Barrow-downs", pp. 146-7</ref>

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Cardolan.mp3|Ardamir}}
''Cardolan'' is a [[Sindarin]] name. Its meaning is not glossed, but several authors suggest it means "red hill country",  "land of red hills" or "Red Hill Land" and is a compound of ''[[caran]]'' ("red"), ''[[dol]]'' ("hill") and ''[[-iand|-(i)an(d)]]'' ("land").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 690</ref><ref>{{HM|GS}}, entry '''Cardolan''', p. 371</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-2202489439.html|articlename=S. ''Cardolan'' loc.|website=Eldamo|accessed=08 February 2022}}</ref><ref name="Clewley">{{webcite|author=Roger Clewley|articleurl=https://tolkienlistsearch.herokuapp.com/message/5e9c3600df6700ce9c85c040|articlename=On the Name ''Cardolan'' (363.63)|dated=7 September 2012|website=[[Elfling]]|accessed=11 September 2012}}</ref> It is possible that the reference to red hills in the name Cardolan is based on the presence of red rock similar to the red stone just west of the [[Ford of Bruinen|ford over the river Loundwater]]<ref>{{FR|Flight}}. p. 213</ref> in Rhudaur.<ref>{{webcite|author=Mark Fisher|articleurl=https://www.glyphweb.com/arda/c/cardolan.php|articlename=Cardolan|website=The Encyclopedia of Arda|accessed=03 March 2022}}</ref>

An alternative etymology has been suggested by Roger Clewley: ''Cardolan'' deriving from [[Noldorin]] ''car'' ("house"), ''dolen'' ("hidden)  ("secret"), and the toponymical ending ''[[-iand|-and]]'', thus meaning "place/land of
hidden houses" (a reference to the "dead entombed there").<ref name="Clewley" />

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the earlier versions of the story, Cardolan was an unnamed ancient kingdom that “fought against the evil foes” long ago. The cairn where the Hobbits were trapped was the barrow of a prince who died during the war (the identification with the [[Last prince of Cardolan|last prince]] and the occurrence of Cardolan, Angmar and Carn Dûm are only subsequent).<ref>{{RS|Wight}}, p. 127-8</ref><ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), [[The Treason of Isengard]], From Bree to the Ford and Rivendell, p. 37</ref> 

Also, in the earlier versions of Tom Bombadil’s statement regarding the blue-jewelled brooch he took for Goldberry, and the mysterious lady that once wore it, he mentioned that “they shall not forget” the kings, the warriors, the children and the fair maidens of the disappeared kingdom, suggesting Bombadil had personally met the men of Cardolan.<ref>{{RS|Wight}}, p. 128</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Cardolan map.jpg|thumb|Map of Cardolan from ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]''.]]
'''2022: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Cardolan, translated as "Land of Red Hills", is featured in its ruined and mostly-abandoned state at the end of the [[Third Age]].

:The northern boundary of the old realm is considered part of [[Bree-land]]; however, the main part of Cardolan lies within its own in-game region of that name. It encompasses the southern reaches of the [[Old Forest]], [[Andrath]], and [[Barrow-downs|Tyrn Gorthad]]; the [[South Downs]]; the wetlands of "Sedgemead" along the [[Gwathló]]; and "Ruddymore" in the south-west, along the [[Baranduin|Brandywine]].

:The [[Orcs|Orc]]-infested ruins of [[Tharbad]] are in the south-easternmost part of Cardolan, where the road runs into the [[Swanfleet]] region.
