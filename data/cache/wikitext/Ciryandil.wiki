'''Ciryandil''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[kiˈrʲandil]}}; {{TA|820}}<ref name=Elendil>{{PM|Elendil}}, manuscript C with corrections and expansions, The Southern Line of Gondor: the Anarioni, 14. Kiryandil</ref> – {{TA|1015|n}},<ref>{{App|South}}, ''Kings of Gondor'', Ciryandil</ref> aged 195 years) was the fourteenth [[King of Gondor]] and the third of the [[Ship-king]]s.<ref>{{App|South}}, ''Kings of Gondor''</ref>

==History==
Ciryandil succeeded his father [[Eärnil I]] in {{TA|936|n}}<ref>{{App|South}}, ''Kings of Gondor'', Eärnil I</ref> and continued Eärnil's policy of building ships.<ref name=Ciryandil>{{App|Gondor}}, entry for king Ciryandil</ref> 

The [[Haradrim]], who were led by the [[Black Númenóreans|lords that had been driven from Umbar]], laid siege to the fortress of Umbar.<ref name=Ciryandil/> In {{TA|1015}} Ciryandil was slain in battle in the siege of Umbar<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1015</ref> in [[Haradwaith]]<ref name=Ciryandil/> He was succeeded by his son [[Ciryaher]], also known as [[Hyarmendacil I]].<ref>{{App|South}}, ''Kings of Gondor'', Hyarmendacil I (Ciryaher)</ref>

==Etymology==
''Ciryandil'' is [[Quenya]]. Its meaning is not glossed, but as Paul Strack explains, it probably means "Ship Lover" and is probably a compound of [[cirya]] ("ship") and the suffix [[-ndil|-(n)dil]] ("lover", "friend").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-1130430251.html|articlename=Q.
