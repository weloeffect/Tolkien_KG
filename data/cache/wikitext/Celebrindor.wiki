'''Celebrindor''' ({{TA|1062}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 193</ref> - {{TA|1272}},<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 210) was the fifth [[King of Arthedain]].

==History==
Celebrindor was the son of [[Celepharn]], and came to the throne of [[Arthedain]] upon his father's death in {{TA|1191|n}}.<ref name="North"/> His reign as king was uneventful, as relations between the other realms of [[Arnor]] - [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]] - were good, and no evil threatened the realm yet - it was after Celebrindor's death that [[Angmar]] started to pose a threat to the peoples of Arnor.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

Celebrindor died in 1272 after ruling the Northern Kingdom for eighty-one years. He was succeeded by his son [[Malvegil]] upon his death.<ref name="North"/>

==Etymology==
''Celebrindor'' is a [[Sindarin]] name. Its meaning is not glossed, but Paul Strack suggests it means "Silver-lord" and is a combination of ''[[celb|celebrin]]'' ("silver", "like silver [in hue or worth]") and the suffixal form ''-dor'' ("king", "lord").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-711865357.html|articlename=S.
