'''Aldor the Old''' ([[Third Age 2544]] – {{TA|2645|n}}, aged 101 years) was the third King of [[Rohan]].<ref name="Mark">{{App|Mark}}</ref>

==History==
Aldor was the second son of King [[Brego]], but became the heir to the throne when his older brother [[Baldor]] vanished in {{TA|2569}}, in an attempt to tread the [[Paths of the Dead]].  His father [[Brego]] died of grief in {{TA|2570|n}} so Aldor then became the King of Rohan.  He reigned for seventy-five years, the longest of any ruler of Rohan, and became known as Aldor the Old.

During his reign the population of the [[Rohirrim]] increased.  The remaining [[Dunlendings]] east of the [[Isen]] River were either driven out or subdued, and [[Harrowdale]] and other valleys in the [[White Mountains|Ered Nimrais]] were settled. 

Aldor had three daughters before his first son, [[Fréa]], was born.<ref name="Mark"/>
