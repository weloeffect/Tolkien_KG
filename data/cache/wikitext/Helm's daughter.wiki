'''Helm's daughter''' was the unnamed daughter of [[Helm|Helm Hammerhand]].<ref name="appendix">{{App|Eorl}}, p. 1065</ref>

==History==
In {{TA|2754}}<ref>{{App|Eorl}}, "Four years later (2758)", p. 1066</ref> [[Freca]], a rich and powerful man with wide lands on both side of the river [[Adorn]], who claimed to be descended from King [[Fréawine]] yet was said to have much [[Dunlendings|Dunlending]] blood, was called to a council by Helm. Freca rode to [[Edoras]] with a great force of men and asked Helm for the hand of his daughter for his son [[Wulf]]. When Helm insulted Freca to have grown fat, Freca in turn insulted Helm to be old and that he could fall on his knees if he refused the staff that Freca had offered with the proposed marriage. After the council Helm took Freca outside, sent everybody away and hit him with his fist so hard that Freca fell down stunned and died soon after that.<ref name="appendix" />

The actions of her father brought a retribution by Wulf who occupied Rohan. The maiden, whose fate during that event was unrecorded, lost her two brothers and father during the [[Long Winter]]. Her cousin, [[Fréaláf]], liberated Rohan and succeeded her father as King.<ref name="appendix" />

'''1985: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]—[[Riders of Rohan (1985 book)|Riders of Rohan]]'':'''
:Helm's daughter is named '''Fréawyn'''.<ref>{{ICE|3100}}, p. 37</ref>

'''2017: ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]]'':'''
:Helm's daughter is featured in this game. She was taken by a warlord who wanted Helm's throne and took his daughter for a lover. Helm was shot at point blank range with arrows. As he lay dying at Edoras, [[Annatar]] and [[Celebrimbor]] visited the wounded king, giving him one of the [[Nine Rings|Nine Rings of Power]]. When he recovered, he attacked his would-be assassin, declaring that war had come upon his enemy's house.<br />However, when Helm's daughter tried to stop her father's rage, Hammerhand accidentally struck her down, killing her (once again, depicted as wielding a war-hammer). Horrified, his grief turned to rage, and Helm proceeded to slaughter his rival and even his own captains who tried to stop him. He was thus transformed by the terrible incident and his Ring of Power into a [[Nazgûl]].

'''2024: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim]]'':'''
:Helm's daughter is featured in this film by the name '''Héra''', named by [[Fran Walsh]] after [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hera_Hilmar Hera Hilmar], the actress previously she worked with on the ''Mortal Engines'' film.<ref>''[[The Art of The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim]]''</ref> She is voiced by [[Gaia Wise]] in English.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14824600/fullcredits|articlename=Full Cast & Crew|dated=|website=IMDB|accessed=20 August 2022}}</ref> As Wulf sought vengeance for his father and forced Helm and his people to make a desperate last stand in the [[Hornburg]], Héra summoned the will to lead the resistance against a deadly enemy intent on their total destruction. Héra is able to defeat Wulf in single combat. Prevailing over the Dunelending forces, Héra proclaims that the Hornburg would be known as [[Helm's Deep]] to future generations. Hera declines the crown in favor of her cousin Fréaláf and soon departs with her aunt [[Olwyn]] to meet a [[Gandalf|wizard]] inquiring after [[Rings of Power|rings]].
