'''Fang''' was one of the guard [[dogs]] of [[Farmer Maggot]]'s [[Bamfurlong]]. Fang was one of the three large, wolf-like dogs, (the other two were named '[[Grip]]' and '[[Wolf (dog)|Wolf]]'). 

These ferocious but well-trained animals lived at his farm at the time of the [[War of the Ring]], but he had evidently kept other dogs before these. [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] had frightening memories of Maggot's dogs going back some thirty years, but the dogs that had threatened him three decades earlier could hardly have been Fang, Grip or Wolf.<ref>{{FR|I4}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Fang means "canine tooth" but was also an archaic English verb meaning "[[grip]]".<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 757</ref>
