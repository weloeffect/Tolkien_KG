}}'''Audrey Corman''' is an Amercan artist who has created numerous [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]-inspired illustrations, many of them for the [[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]. While she prefers to work in oils, the long time to dry forced her to use acrylic gouache for card art.<ref name=MECCG>''[[CarolinaCon Regional MECCG Newsletter]]'' #2 ([[24 August|August 24]], [[1998]])</ref>

==Career==
After her childhood in the Bronx, she entered Lehman College as an Art Major after [[Dragon Magazine]] cover artists got her interest in art. She ended up graduating with a degree in Chemistry instead, due to pressure from her parents and discouragement from the faculty when it came to fantasy and realistic paintings. While working as a research chemist she picked up drawing again, attending night classes at the Rhode Island School of Design.

Her work for [[Iron Crown Enterprises]] started after her private airbrushing instructor, whose classes she was attending, recommended her to the company while they were scouting for new talents.<ref name=MECCG/>
