'''Boromir''' ([[Third Age]] 2410<ref name="Elendil">{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 205</ref> – 2489,<ref name="South">{{App|South}}</ref> aged 79 years) was the eleventh [[Ruling Steward]] of [[Gondor]].

Boromir was noble and fair of face, strong in body and will; during his prime he was a great captain that even the [[Witch-king]] feared.<ref name=stew>{{App|Stewards}}</ref>

==History==
Boromir was the third child of [[Denethor I]]<ref name="Elendil"/> during whose time the realm was under siege and [[Ithilien]] had been lost to fierce [[Uruk-hai]]. He succeeded his father upon his death in {{TA|2477}} and fought several extensive campaigns to win back the land. Despite his victory, Ithilien remained depopulated, [[Osgiliath]] was finally ruined with its stone-bridge broken.<ref name=stew/>

During that war he received a [[Morgul-wounds|Morgul-wound]] and despite all his might and strength, he became shrunken with pain and ruled only twelve years.<ref name=stew/>

He was followed by his son [[Cirion]] at his death in 2489.<ref name="South"/>

Centuries later, Steward [[Denethor II]] named his heir [[Boromir]], after him.<ref name=stew/>
