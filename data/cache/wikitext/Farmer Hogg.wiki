'''Farmer Hogg''' was an old [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] inhabitant of the town of [[Delving]] who appeared in ''[[Perry-the-Winkle]]'', a nursery rhyme<ref name=collectedpoems>{{CP|105}}</ref> by [[Samwise Gamgee]]<ref name=preface>{{AB|Preface}}</ref>.<ref name="Perry">{{AB|Perry}}, pp. 41-4</ref>

In the poem, Farmer Hogg spilled his ale upon seeing the [[Lonely Troll]] peeping over the stalls of the market-place.<ref name="Perry" />

Later, Farmer Hogg was among the [[Shire-hobbits]] who travelled to [[Faraway]] in order to demand food from the Lonely Troll. Farmer Hogg was among four Hobbits who the Troll never wanted to see again.<ref name="Perry" />

==Background==
In every version of the poem, Farmer Hogg remarkably retained the same name and the same action of spilling his drink, which was beer in all of the [[Tales and Songs of Bimble Bay|Bimble Bay]] versions rather than ale.<ref name=collectedpoems>{{CP|105}}</ref>
