== Lyrics ==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Come to me lady of a foreign shore 
to pass on your knowledge to me, 
interrupt these peacefull lands with your odem of pestilence 
Your lifeform is living in the deepest twilight, 
the depths of Avathar. 

Your odem goes down the green rivers and 
high up to the blue skies, to the wide open forests and 
mountains so high, far away to the unknown and 
at last to destroy the two trees of life on 
the hills of [[Ezellohar]]... 

So high my throne, so cold as ice 
it makes my blue eyes turn red 
and this red covers my stronghold [[Angband]] 
as a shadow fog to keep it unseen... 
The Silmaril now covers my crown 

Keep away Ungolianth...
</poem>
