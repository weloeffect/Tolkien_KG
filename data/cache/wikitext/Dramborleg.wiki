The '''Axe of Tuor''' was the great axe that [[Tuor]] favoured over any sword.

==History==
Tuor fought with the axe during the [[Fall of Gondolin]], taking it with him when he escaped the downfall of the city. His descendants later took it with them to [[Númenor]] as an heirloom. It was lost during the [[Downfall of Númenor]] because only the [[Ring of Barahir]] was said to have survived.<ref name="Numenor">{{UT|3a}}, Note 2</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', the Axe of Tuor was called '''Dramborleg''', meaning "Thudder-Sharp" in [[Gnomish]], though it was also known as ''Drambor''. The axe was named so because with it, Tuor "smote both a heavy dint as of a club and cleft as a sword";<ref name="Name">{{LT2|Appendix}}, entry "Dramborleg"</ref> he slew three [[Balrogs]] and some [[Orcs]] named [[Othrod]], [[Balcmeg]], and [[Lug]].<ref>{{LT2|III}}, p. 181</ref> The [[Qenya]] cognates of Dramborleg were '''''Tarambolaika''''' or '''''Tarambor'''''.<ref name="Name" />
