The '''creation of the Ainur''' was a great event prior to the creation of [[Eä]], in which [[Ilúvatar|Eru Ilúvatar]] created the [[Ainur]] ("Holy Ones"), his servants.

==History==
Ilúvatar made the Ainur "in the beginning",<ref>{{S|IIa}}</ref> before the creation of [[Time]], in the [[Timeless Halls]] that he had prepared for them.<ref>{{S|Ainu}}, "...he went forth from the fair regions that he had made for the Ainur"</ref> As offspring of his thought, at first each one only "comprehended that part of the mind of Ilúvatar from which he came". After this, He propounded to them themes of music, which later would initiate the [[Music of the Ainur]] and the Creation of the World.

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the first version of the story, it is specified that Ilúvatar "sang into being the Ainur" and thereafter he made their dwellings in the [[void]].<ref>{{LT1|Music}}, p. 52</ref>

==Inspiration==
The creation of a spiritual hierarchy resembles the creation of angels by the Judeo-Chistian God. However, it also implies ideas previous to [[Christianity]], as [[Verlyn Flieger]] explains:

{{blockquote|The concept of offspring from One suggests a sort of Pythagorean divisibility of a unity into component parts without disminution of the whole. The Ainur are powers or principalities emanating directly from the godhead and are developed in the text as aspects of his nature.<ref>[[Verlyn Flieger]], ''[[Splintered Light]]'' (Revised Edition), "Splintered Light and Splintered Being", p. 51</ref>}}
