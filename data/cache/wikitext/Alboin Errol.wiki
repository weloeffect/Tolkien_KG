'''Alboin Errol''' was one of the main characters in [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s unfinished "[[The Lost Road|Lost Road]]" story of time travel. Alboin was the son of [[Oswin Errol|Oswin]] and father of [[Audoin|Audoin Errol]]. Alboin and his son travel through time to the fall of [[Númenor]], and after that the story falls apart with many different ideas and opinions, none of which seem to be fully formed.<ref>{{LR|Lost}}, p. 36 ff.</ref>
