'''Sean Patrick Astin''' (born [[1971]]) is an American film actor who played [[Samwise Gamgee]] in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] and some of the tie-in games of the franchise. 

==History==
Amusingly, he kept meticulous count of the times when he was fitted with ''hobbit feet'' and subsequently the feet were never "in shot".

He suffered an injury during the filming of the scene at [[Parth Galen]] when Sam ran into the river after [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] — there was a shard of glass in the river bed and Astin's foot was pierced and bled profusely. Despite the injury he was back on set the next day.  

Both of his parents worked in the film industry: his father John Astin created the character of Gomez Addams in the TV series "The Addams Family" while his mother, Patty Duke, won an Oscar for her performance in "The Miracle Worker".

==Quotes==
{{quote|I just wanted to allow whatever essence of goodness there is within me to come forth and to inhabit the role of Sam, because that's what he is: he's goodness, loyalty, decency; that, I think, is his function in the books.|Sean Astin, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Official Movie Guide]]''}}
{{quote|The Lord of the Rings was just so much enjoyment. It was over about the space of a year that I was filming. It's one of the most enjoyable things I've ever done...so emotional.|Sean Astin}}
{{quote|Sam is the best kind of friend. Through thick or thin, he is always there. I found myself gravitating toward that quality in my portrayal, toward this idea of an earnest, loyal, decent fellow.|Sean Astin, lordoftherings.net}}
