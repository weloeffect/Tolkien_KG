'''Harry Goatleaf''' was a [[Men of Bree|Man of Bree]] and a member of the [[Goatleaf Family]].

== History ==
Harry Goatleaf worked as a [[Gate-keepers|Gate-keeper]] stationed at the [[West-gate of Bree|western gate]] in the great hedge that surrounded the township of [[Bree]].<ref name=Gate>{{FR|I9}}</ref> On [[23 September]], [[Strider]] observed the [[Nazgûl]] having a conversation with Goatleaf before leaving him white and shaking.<ref name=Monday>{{FR|I10}}</ref> When [[Frodo Baggins]] and his [[Travellers|companions]] arrived at the town, he got a lantern and questioned them gruffly about their intentions, silently observing that they came from the [[Shire]] before letting them in. Before wishing them good night, he warned them that there would be more folk besides him at ''[[The Prancing Pony]]'' who would ask them questions.<ref name=Gate/>

After [[Strider]] advised the four [[Hobbits]] to be more careful as the [[Nazgûl]] were seen passing the [[Greenway]] the previous [[Monday]], Frodo realized that he should have known this from the way the Goatleaf spoke. Later, when Strider predicts that something may happen that night before they leave Bree, he mentioned that the Goatleaf may be a spy for the Nazgûl, noting the conversation he had overheard.<ref name=Monday>{{FR|I10}}</ref>

Before the end of {{TA|3018}}, the [[Men of Bree]] kicked the [[Ruffians]] among the [[Southerners]] out of Bree. Early in the [[New Year]] however, the town was attacked in the night by the very same Ruffians. During the battle, Goatleaf fought on the side of the Ruffians along with [[Bill Ferny]]. After the battle, Goatleaf left Bree alongside the other Ruffians, hiding out in either the [[Chetwood]] beyond [[Archet]], or in the wilds north of Bree. Later, it was believed by [[Barliman Butterbur]] that Goatleaf and Ferny were the ones who let the Ruffians in on the night of the battle.<ref>{{RK|VI7}}</ref> Goatleaf's position as a Gate-keeper was presumably later taken by another Gate-keeper.

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In an early draft, Harry Goatleaf whispered with Bill Ferney and the [[squint-eyed southerner]] in a corner of the Prancing Pony and slipped out behind them after Frodo's song. He is described later on in the draft as "''a mean old curmudgeon''". In another draft, [[Gandalf]] is at the gate and asks Goatleaf if he had seen any Shire-hobbits. Goatleaf revealed that he did not as he was in [[Staddle]] and his brother, [[Ned Goatleaf|Ned]], was at the gate in his place. After advising Gandalf to head to the inn, he shut the gate. Later in this draft, the Black Riders came to the gate and Harry revealed Gandalf's entry. A few moments later, when Frodo passed through, he was more friendly than in the published text, and the dialogue was slightly expanded.<ref>{{RS|Sign}}, pp. 333-4, 336, 342, 344-5, 347-9, 354</ref>
