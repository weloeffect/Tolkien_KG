'''''The War of the Ring''''', published in [[1990]], is the eighth volume of [[Christopher Tolkien]]'s 12-volume book series, ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', in which he analyzes the unpublished manuscripts of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].

It is also the third volume of ''[[The History of The Lord of the Rings]]'', which documents the writing process of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

This book covers part of ''[[The Two Towers]]'' and part of ''[[The Return of the King]]''. Following the development of the previous books, the story continues to the opening of the [[Black Gate]].

The title ''The War of the Ring'' was the original title for Book 5 of ''TLotR'', later discarded by Tolkien.
