'''Brego''' was the second [[King of Rohan]].<ref name="Mark">{{App|Mark}}</ref>

==History==
Brego became King at the death of his father [[Eorl the Young]] in {{TA|2545}}.<ref name=ta>{{App|TA}}</ref> During his rule the migration of the [[Éothéod]] to [[Calenardhon]] continued, and Brego defended the borders of [[Rohan]] against their enemies (the [[Dunlendings]] and [[Easterlings]]) and drove off the [[Wold]] the remaining [[Orcs]] and [[Balchoth]].

Brego built the [[Golden Hall]] of [[Meduseld]] ({{TA|2569}}),<ref name=ta/> and made [[Edoras]] the capital of Rohan.

His eldest son [[Baldor]] in his pride went into the [[Paths of the Dead]] never to be found again, and Brego died of grief the next year.<ref name=ta/> He was followed by his second son, [[Aldor]].<ref name="Mark"/>

==Etymology==
''Brego'' means "chief, leader, king, lord" in [[Old English]], which Tolkien used to represent [[Rohanese]] in his works.

Outside ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the plural form of the word, ''Bregan'' ("Rulers") also appeared in earlier writings as one of the Old English words for the [[Valar]] by [[Ælfwine]].<ref>{{SM|QA1}}</ref>
