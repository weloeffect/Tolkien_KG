The '''Witch-king of Angmar''' was the chief of the [[Nazgûl]], King of [[Angmar]] and [[Sauron]]'s great captain in his wars. A [[Wraiths|wraith]], the Witch-king of Angmar was nearly indestructible, a terrifying warrior, and a cunning strategist.

==History==
[[File:Catherine Chmiel - The King of Nazgûl.jpg|thumb|left|''The King of Nazgûl'' by [[:Category:Images by Catherine Karina Chmiel|Catherine Chmiel]]]]
Some time after Sauron seized the [[Rings of Power]] in the [[Sack of Eregion]], {{SA|1697}} he gave [[Nine Rings|nine of them]] to [[Men|Mannish]] kings, sorcerers and other warriors.<ref>{{S|Rings}}, p. 289</ref>  With the power of their rings, the Nine achieved glory and grew wealthy, but they eventually started hating life as they were slowly drawn under Sauron’s dominion. In the end, they all became the dreadful [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]].

The one later known as the Witch-king<ref group="note">According to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] the oldest meaning of ''witch'' is "a man who practices witchcraft or magic; a magician, sorcerer, wizard"</ref> was a sorcerer,<ref>{{FR|Council}}, p. 257</ref><ref name="RK|Siege">{{RK|Siege}}, p. 819</ref> probably<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 20 citing from J.R.R. Tolkien's manuscript of ''Nomenclature'' "he was probably (like the Lieutenant of Barad-dur [the Mouth of Sauron]) of Numenorean descent"</ref> one of the unnamed three lords of [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] race, who accepted one of the Rings of Power.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> He first appeared in the histories as a Ringwraith in {{SA|2251}}. Being the most powerful of the Nazgûl, he became their chief and the most feared servant of his master Sauron.

When [[Mordor]] fell in {{SA|3441}}, the Nazgûl vanished into the shadows and were not heard of again for a long time.<ref>{{App|SA}}, entry for the year 3441, p. 1084</ref>

===Early power in Angmar===
More than a thousand years later, in c. {{TA|1050|n}} of the [[Third Age]], [[Sauron]] began to rebuild his power in [[Dol Guldur]]. In c. {{TA|1300|n}} his Nazgûl also reappeared and the Witch-king established his realm, [[Angmar]], in the north.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1300, p. 1086</ref> His capital was [[Carn Dûm]], on the northernmost peak of the [[Misty Mountains]]. He summoned men, [[orcs]] and other creatures of evil inclination to his banner. No one knew that he was actually a servant of the long-dormant [[Sauron]] and few that he was a wraith.<ref name="Malvegil">{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', entry for King Malvegil, p. 1040</ref>

In the north, disunity plagued the [[Dúnedain]] of [[Arnor]]. They had divided into three kingdoms: [[Cardolan]], [[Rhudaur]] and [[Arthedain]], and were constantly at war with one another.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', p. 1039</ref> The Witch-king saw the North-kingdom of Arnor as more vulnerable than the South-kingdom of Gondor.<ref name="Malvegil" /> He played upon their opposition, sending in infiltrators and taking over the hearts of the men of that land. By {{TA|1349|n}}, the government of Rhudaur was controlled by men secretly in his service,<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, entry for [[Malvegil]], pp. 193-194</ref> and he secretly aided them in their wars against the other kingdoms.<ref name="Argeleb">{{PM|Elendil}}, entry for [[Argeleb I]], p. 194</ref> He then struck at a time of great hostility among the three, in {{TA|1409|n}}. Rhudaur in the east fell first, and most of the Dúnedain there were hunted down and slaughtered by sorcerers.<ref name="Arveleg">{{PM|Elendil}}, entry for [[Arveleg I]], p. 194</ref> Cardolan was ravaged and its [[last prince of Cardolan|last prince]] slain;<ref>{{HM|RC}}, "Fog on the Barrow-downs", pp. 144-5; Index, 'Cardolan, [[Last prince of Cardolan|last prince of]]'</ref> the tower of [[Weathertop|Amon Sûl]], held by the men of Arthedain, was placed under siege. King [[Arveleg I]] was slain and the tower was destroyed, but the coveted ''[[Amon Sûl-stone|palantír]]'' escaped in the hands of the surviving men of Arthedain and was brought to [[Fornost]].<ref name="Palantiri16">{{UT|14a}}, Note 16, p. 413</ref>

The Witch-king continued to press the men of Arthedain, laying siege to Fornost, and he might have taken over all of Arnor in that one offensive. But [[Araphor]], the 18-year-old son of Arveleg, came to leadership and, with the help of the ancient elf [[Círdan]] of [[Lindon]], repelled the Witch-king’s forces at Fornost and the [[North Downs]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', entry for King Araphor, p. 1040</ref> [[Elrond]] brought an army of [[Elves]] from [[Rivendell]] and [[Lothlórien]], and the Witch-king was pushed back and subdued.

===Twilight of Angmar===
The Witch-king sat silent in Carn Dûm, rebuilding his armies and preparing for a final assault on [[Arthedain]], last of the Arnorian kingdoms. The [[Great Plague]] came and went in {{TA|1636|n}}, taking with it the last of the Dúnedain of [[Cardolan]]. The Witch-king sent [[barrow-wights]] to inhabit the barrows in [[Barrow-downs|Tyrn Gorthad]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', entry for King Argeleb II, p. 1041</ref> In {{TA|1974|n}}, he felt that his power was sufficiently restored to begin the advance.

His attack was sudden, but not unexpected. King [[Arvedui]] sent a message to King [[Eärnil II]] of [[Gondor]] the year before, but help did not arrive in time. [[Fornost Erain]] fell, and the Witch-king took up residence there in the palace.<ref name="Eärnil">{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Eärnil II, p. 1051</ref> Arvedui held out as best as he might on the [[North Downs]], but at last fled north with the treasured ''[[palantíri]]'' of [[Amon Sûl-stone|Amon Sûl]] and [[Annúminas-stone|Annúminas]]. He would not return, for he perished in a shipwreck in {{TA|1975|n}}. With him the ''palantíri'' were lost forever in the icy seas of [[Forod]]. The already-diminished North-kingdom ended, and [[Arnor]] fell.<ref name="Arvedui">{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', entry for King Arvedui and entry for Chieftain Aranarth, pp. 1041-3</ref>

Meanwhile, a coalition in the south had formed. Eärnil sent his son, [[Eärnur]], north with a great fleet, all that Gondor could spare. They arrived at [[Lindon]] and joined with the folk of Círdan. Círdan summoned all that would come: surviving Dúnedain of Arnor and elves of Lindon.<ref name="Eärnil" /> Even a company of [[Hobbits|hobbit]] archers went to their aide.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', entry for King Arvedui, p. 1042</ref> The Witch-king had grown overconfident and, instead of staying behind his fortifications, initiated the attack. The [[Battle of Fornost]] was fought on the plain between [[Nenuial]] and the North Downs. The Witch-king may not have anticipated the strength brought against him, but for whatever reason the alliance gained the upper hand. His army began to fall back toward Fornost, but Eärnur’s magnificent horsemen struck from the north and the Witch-king was routed.<ref name="Eärnil" />

He decided to flee to Angmar and the safety of Carn Dûm, but the cavalry, with Eärnur himself in the lead, overtook him.  Moreover, the ranks of the allies swelled, as an army of elves from [[Rivendell]] came led by the mighty hero of old, [[Glorfindel]]. Angmar was purged of men and orcs, and all seemed lost for the Witch-king in the face of such numbers. But the Witch-king himself came at the last, robed and masked in black and riding a black horse, and attempted to kill Eärnur with his own hands. But Eärnur’s horse shied away and fled, and the Witch-king laughed. But Glorfindel came on his white horse, and faced with such power the Witch-king fled.  He vanished into the shadows and no-one marked where he had gone.<ref name="Eärnil" />

Eärnur wanted to pursue, but Glorfindel held him back and made his famous prophecy.

{{Blockquote|He will not return to this land.  Far off yet is his doom, and not by the hand of man will he fall.|Glorfindel, ''[[The Return of the King]]'', [[Appendix A]] (iv)}}

===Lord of Minas Morgul===
[[File:Alan Lee - The Witch-king.jpg|thumb|''The Witch-king'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]
The Witch-king escaped to [[Mordor]], and gathered the other Ringwraiths about him in {{TA|1980|n}}. Angmar and Carn Dûm were lost, and so in {{TA|2000|n}} the Ringwraiths began a [[Second Fall of Minas Ithil|two-year siege]] of [[Minas Ithil]], eventually capturing the place and turning it into his residence. The wraiths sent an aura of fear in [[Gondor]], and much of [[Ithilien]] was deserted.<ref name="gondor" />

Eärnur succeeded his father as King of Gondor, and still held the Witch-king in especial hostility due to his humiliation at the Battle of Fornost. [[Third Age 2043|The year]] of his coronation the Witch-king sent him a taunting challenge, but [[Mardil]] the [[steward]] restrained Eärnur from rash action. [[Third Age 2050|Seven years later]] the challenge was repeated, and Eärnur rode with a small escort to Minas Morgul; none ever returned, and there was no longer a King in Gondor.<ref name="gondor">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

After this the Witch-king bided his time.  He and the Nazgûl built up their armies, including the terrible new orc-race of [[Uruks]]. In {{TA|2475|n}} he sent them out to capture [[Osgiliath]], which they did successfully.  They were driven out by [[Boromir (Steward of Gondor)|Boromir]], [[Ruling Steward|Steward]] of [[Gondor]], who led campaigns to recapture Ithilien, but Osgiliath now lay completely in ruins and the region was left devastated and depopulated. Boromir was a great captain, and even the Witch-king feared him, but he was felled by a Morgul-wound and his rule was but twelve years.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}, entry for Steward Boromir, p. 1053</ref>

===Hunt for the Ring===
Sauron declared himself openly in {{TA|2951|n}}, and sent three of his Ringwraiths to [[Dol Guldur]] (though the Witch-king was left in Minas Morgul). Then, by lucky chance, the creature [[Gollum]] was captured and interrogated. Under torture, the wretched creature revealed the tale of [[the One Ring]] and how it came to be in his possession.  But from his words, Sauron misunderstood that the land of the hobbits who stole the Ring was on the banks of the [[Gladden River]], whence Gollum originally came from.<ref name="thirteen">{{UT|Hunt}}, p. 338-341</ref> Sauron sent the Nine, under the leadership of the Witch-king, invisible and uncloaked, to search for the Ring after the assault of Osgiliath.

[[Khamûl]], the Witch-king’s lieutenant, reported that he was unable to find the “[[the Shire|Shire]]” in the vales of [[Anduin]].  The Witch-king was determined to search north and west until Gollum was found, or the Shire.  But plans were halted when Sauron received word of the events in Gondor and the doings of the turncoat [[Saruman]], and concluded that the Wise did not yet have possession of the Ring.  He sent the Ringwraiths to [[Isengard]] in the form of [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]], and as they passed through Rohan their terror was so great that many fled the land, believing the Riders heralded an invasion. 

They arrived at Isengard too late to prevent the escape of the captured wizard [[Gandalf]]; Saruman realized he had been revealed as a traitor to both sides due to his transparent lust for the Ring, and having no chance of deceiving Sauron any further, fortified himself in Isengard. The Witch-king did not have enough power with him to assault Saruman in his great fortress. He demanded the Wizard come forth, but received only the voice of Saruman. Nonetheless cunning and wary, Saruman convinced the Witch-king that Gandalf alone knew where the Shire and the Ring were, and so the Nine went out in search of him.<ref name="thirteen" />

The Ringwraiths came upon the traitor called [[Gríma|Wormtongue]] and questioned him.  The terrified man told them everything he knew; that Gandalf had passed through Rohan, where the Shire was, and even that Saruman had lied to them.  The Witch-king spared Wormtongue’s life, foreseeing that Wormtongue would bring ruin to Saruman.  He divided his wraiths into four pairs, and went with the swiftest to [[Minhiriath]].  Along the way they captured several spies of Saruman, and found to their delight charts and maps of the Shire. They sent along the spy to [[Bree]], warning them that they now belonged to Mordor, not Saruman.<ref name="thirteen" />
[[File:Francesco Amadio - Amon Sul.jpg|thumb|left|220px|''Amon Sul'' by [[:Category:Images by Francesco Amadio|Francesco Amadio]]]]
They came to [[Sarn Ford]], but the [[Dúnedain]] [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]] prevented them from crossing. The Rangers sent for their captain, [[Aragorn II]], as he was away, but defeating the Nazgûl was a task beyond the power of the Dúnedain, and may have been so even had Aragorn been present; the Ringwraiths attacked at night, capturing the ford and killing many of the Rangers. A few survivors fled northward to warn Aragorn of the wraiths' approach, but were pursued and slain or driven off into the wilds.<ref name="thirteen" /> The Witch-king sent three Ringwraiths under Khamûl into the Shire while he went east with the others.<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3018, September 22, p. 1091</ref> But they had come too late: the Ring had moved on in the hands of a hobbit, [[Frodo Baggins]].<ref name="Knife">{{FR|Knife}}</ref>

===Pursuit of the Ring===
Khamûl was unsuccessful, but brought word from the spy they had spared in Bree. The man had witnessed a vanishing act on Frodo's part, and had organized an attack on the inn. The Witch-king assumed that Frodo would head east to [[Rivendell]], and sent four wraiths to [[Weathertop]],<ref>{{HM|RC}}, citing from ''The Hunt for the Ring'', p. 164-6</ref> the ruins of the tower he had destroyed long ago. He went south along the [[Greenway]] and discovered nothing. Gandalf followed them, but the Witch-king let him slip ahead, and attacked him on Weathertop. Gandalf escaped at dawn, and again the Witch-king divided his force and sent four after the wizard while he and Khamûl remained near Weathertop to watch it.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, citing from ''The Hunt for the Ring'', p. 167-8</ref>

The chieftain of the Dúnedain, Aragorn II, had become the guide of the hobbits, and led them to Weathertop, where they were spotted and attacked by the Ringwraiths led by the Witch-king. The Witch-king advanced on Frodo, and the terrified hobbit put on the Ring, seeing the wraiths as they truly were. The Witch-king was taller than the others, with long hair and a crown set on his helm. When Frodo resisted the wraith's approach, and invoked the name of [[Varda|Elbereth]], the Witch-king stabbed Frodo in the shoulder.<ref name="Knife" /> The tip of his [[Morgul-knife|blade]] broke off and remained in Frodo's shoulder.<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}, pp. 221-2</ref> Then Aragorn counterattacked with flaming brands.<ref name="Knife" /> The Witch-king departed with the other Nazgûl, believing that his objective was completed.

He resumed the pursuit quickly, though,<ref>{{HM|RC}}, citing from ''The Hunt for the Ring'', pp. 180-1</ref> and found that Khamûl had been driven from the [[Last Bridge]] by his old enemy [[Glorfindel]]. The Witch-king, who only had one companion with him, was likewise unable to confront him openly.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, citing from ''The Hunt for the Ring'', p. 194</ref> They regrouped and went south, rejoining with the other four. They managed to pick up the trail of the company of the Ring, and despite hindrance from Glorfindel and Aragorn managed to pursue Frodo alone on [[Asfaloth]]. The pursuit came to the [[Ford of Bruinen]], and there Frodo compelled the horse to stop. The Witch-king saw his defiance and laughed, breaking his sword with a movement of his hand. But the waters of the [[Bruinen]] rose at [[Elrond]]'s command, sweeping the Nine downstream.<ref name="fourteen">{{FR|Flight}}</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, citing from ''The Hunt for the Ring'', p. 195-6</ref>

===War of the Ring===
[[File:Angus McBride - Gandalf facing Witch-king.gif|thumb|''Gandalf facing the Witch-king'' by [[Angus McBride]]]]
The Witch-king took the only surviving horse back to [[Mordor]], arriving there in December. In addition, help was sent to the other eight Nazgûl when they were on their way back.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, citing from a manuscript of The Hunt for the Ring, p. 262</ref>  In [[Minas Morgul]] they prepared for a grand invasion of [[Gondor]] at the order of their master. The Witch-king was given by Sauron added "demonic" force.<ref name="fifteen">{{L|210}}, p. 272</ref> On 10 March {{TA|3019|n}},<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019, March 10, p. 1093</ref> the signal was given and Minas Morgul was emptied. The Witch-king rode at the head of the army clothed in black with a crown on his hooded head. As the Witch-king passed out of the gates of the dead city in the direction of Ithilien, he stopped, probably sensing the presence of [[the One Ring]], but he continued riding down the road after a while.<ref name="Stairs" />

The army from Minas Morgul commanded by the Witch-king was reinforced by regiments of [[Haradrim]] outnumbered the forces of [[Faramir]], [[Ruling Steward|Steward]] [[Denethor|Denethor II]]'s son, who defended the fords over the river [[Anduin]] at [[Osgiliath]] ten times and soon managed to cross the river in a large numbers of floats and barges, which they had secretly built on the eastern side of Osgiliath on the eastern side of the river. As a consequence, Faramir retreated with his men to the [[Causeway Forts]] at the [[Rammas Echor]].<ref name="Siege">{{RK|Siege}}, p. 817</ref> The Rammas Echor was breached, and the [[Pelennor Fields]] were overrun. Other wraiths he sent out mounted on [[Fell beasts]]. Faramir was wounded by a dart and the [[Black Breath|black breath]], but his company was saved by a sortie. Then the Witch-king laid siege to [[Minas Tirith]] itself, sending fire and the heads of the dead Gondorians into the city via catapults. Then he launched the assault.

He sent [[Grond (battering ram)|Grond]] out first, accompanying it in person so as to be the first to enter the city.  Three times Grond struck the gate, empowered by the sorcery of the Witch-king. The third time the Gate shattered in a flash of fire. The Witch-king passed into Minas Tirith, but was confronted by Gandalf on [[Shadowfax]]. Gandalf forbade him entry, but the Witch-king laughed and put on a show of power.

{{Blockquote|The Black Rider flung back his hood, and behold! he had a kingly crown; and yet upon no head visible was it set. The red fires shone between it and the mantled shoulders vast and dark. From a mouth unseen there came a deadly laughter.<br>'Old fool!' he said. 'Old fool! This is my hour. Do you not know Death when you see it?  Die now and curse in vain!' And with that he lifted high his sword and flames ran down the blade.|''[[The Return of the King]]'', "[[The Siege of Gondor]]"}}

===Fall===
[[File:Alarie - Eowyn and the Witchking 2.jpg|thumb|left|''Éowyn and the Witch-king'' by [[:Category:Images by Alarie|Alarie]]]]
As Gandalf stood resolute before the Witch-king, the [[Rohirrim]] arrived. Thus he departed, mounting a fell beast and descending upon King [[Théoden]] who led the attack.  [[Snowmane]], the King's horse, collapsed with a dart in the side, and Théoden was crushed beneath him.  But the rider [[Dernhelm]] defied the Witch-king.  The Witch-king threatened Dernhelm with a terrible death, but the rider revealed that she was a woman, [[Éowyn]], and the Witch-king remembered the words of Glorfindel. He hesitated, but then moved forward. Éowyn decapitated the fell beast, but the Witch-king rose and struck her down with his mace, breaking her shield-arm. Then the hobbit [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] stabbed him in the sinew of his leg with the [[Daggers of Westernesse|blade of Westernesse]] (though there was much pain in Meriadoc's arm afterwards), as he drew back to kill the woman.  Then Éowyn rose and drove her sword through where his invisible head was, and the sword broke as his crown toppled.  The Witch-king gave a great and horrible wail, perishing at last (in the [[Letters]] it is said he was “reduced to impotence”).<ref name="Pelennor">{{RK|Battle}}</ref>

So the prophecy of Glorfindel was fulfilled, for the Witch-king did not fall at the hands of a man, but that of [[Éowyn|a woman]]; and not by a [[Men|Man]] but [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|a Halfling]]. With his defeat, and the coming of Aragorn II in the black ships, the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] was lost by Sauron.

==Other versions of the legendarium==
The Witch-king was originally introduced in the story as the "Wizard King" during the development of [[The Council of Elrond]] chapter.<ref>{{TI|VI}}, p. 116</ref> He continues to be referred to under that name in outlines<ref>{{WR|3|VI}}, p. 326</ref><ref>{{WR|3|VIII}}, p. 359</ref> and a manuscript for the chapter [[The Siege of Gondor]] where  Gandalf says that he is not only the captain of the [[Black Riders]], but a former member of his own [[Istari|order]] before "evil took him"<ref>{{WR|3|VI}}, p. 331</ref>.

In the early versions of the story, the "Wizard King" was planned to survive the Pelennor Fields battle and appear as the ambassador at the [[Black Gate]] instead of the [[Mouth of Sauron]].<ref>{{WR|3|VIII}}, pp. 361-362 and note 12, p. 364</ref> In early manuscripts the "Wizard King" even survived after [[Frodo]] has thrown the Ring in [[Sammath Naur]], blocking the door and saying: “Here we all end together”. At this point, either Sam appears at his back and stabs him from behind (with Sting?), or Frodo draws Sting, commands him to follow the Ring and drives him into the Fire.<ref>{{SD|1|Mordor}}, pp. 5-7</ref>

In the rare manuscript ''[[The Hunt for the Ring|The Hunt for the Ring: Time Scheme - Black Riders]]'', Tolkien speculates that the Witch-King might be afraid of Frodo, as he invoked [[Elbereth]] (a “name of terror for the Nazgûl”) and he could have slain the Barrow-wight.<ref name="RC">{{HM|RC}}, "Flight to the Ford", p. 180</ref>

==Etymology==
While in modern English ''witch'' has mostly female connotations, referring to a hag or sorceress, in middle-English 
''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_(word) wicche]'' had no gender distinction; the preference of ''witch'' for female persons (the males referred more usually as ''wizzards'') evolved later through the centuries. Tolkien uses the archaic, gender-unspecific meaning of the term, which was "a man who practises witchcraft or magic; a magician, sorcerer or wizard".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 21 citing from the 'Oxford English Dictionary'</ref>

==Other names==
*Witch-king of Angmar<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Eärnil II, p. 1050</ref> - "Witch" most likely coming from his background in sorcery, and "king" after his establishment of the realm of Angmar in 1300.

==Inspiration==
An undead witch-king named ''Þráinn'' appears in ''[[:Wikipedia:Hrómundar saga Gripssonar|Hrómundar saga Gripssonar]]''. It is possible that this was Tolkien's source of inspiration.{{fact}}

<!-- I think that the Shapeskearean inspiration is told in Carpenter's biography -->
The prophecy that the Witch-king would fall "not by the hand of man" and the fulfillment of the prophecy occurring as a technicality (being slain by a hobbit and a woman) bears a striking resemblance to the prophecy regarding the title character's death in Shakespeare's ''Macbeth'', where it was foretold that Macbeth will be slain "not by man born of woman" and is then killed by Macduff, born by caesarian section. Tolkien was familiar with the play, having reputedly taken inspiration for the Last March of the Ents from the same source (See article ''[[Ents]]'' for details).

==Portrayal in adaptations== 
The Witch-king's true name is never given, and therefore among [[Tolkien fandom|Tolkien fans]], the Witch-king is often simply called ''Angmar'', after the name of the realm he founded and led. It is possible that he was one of the three [[Black Númenóreans]] Tolkien stated had become Nazgûl, or possibly [[Isilmo]], a Númenórean prince and father of Tar-Minastir. This possibility was adopted by the now defunct [[Middle-earth Role Playing]] game and [[Mithril Miniatures]] where he is named ''Er-Murazor'', a Númenórean prince and younger son of [[Tar-Ciryatan]].

===Films===
'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:The Witch-king is shown with no distinction from the other [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]]; all are robed in brown and black, and none seem to be able to talk clearly.

'''1980: [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]:'''
:The Witch-king is portrayed as a humanoid figure with no head. Red eyes glare under a golden crown. His dialogue is more or less as in the books, albeit in a strange and somewhat unfitting electronic voice. After a stab from behind by [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], [[Éowyn]] beheads him. It is worthy of note that the Witch-king is seen with the [[Red Eye]] of [[Barad-dûr]] as his emblem and faction, rather than the grim moon of [[Minas Morgul]].

'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''
:The Witch-king is called the "Witch-king of [[Angmar]]", the "Lord of the [[Nazgûl]]", and the "Greatest of the Nine" by [[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]''; however, no other mention of the kingdom of Angmar itself is made. Also, in that film, there is no mention of [[Glorfindel]]'s prophecy; there is only a claim among the enemy that "no man can kill" the Witch-king.  Like the other Nazgûl, he is depicted as a humanoid figure shrouded in a hooded black robe; his only distinguishing feature is a mask-like spiked helmet with a huge mouth. His first mention is when Gandalf tells [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] while in Minas Tirith that the Dark Lord has not yet revealed his "deadliest" servant: the Witch-king, the one that "stabbed [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] on [[Weathertop]]".

:During the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], the Witch-king's army uses the ram [[Grond (battering ram)|Grond]] to break through the city gates early in the battle (after the failure of a lesser ram), and the Witch-king is not present to confront Gandalf as he is in the book. The confrontation takes place later, as Pippin and Gandalf race to the tombs to save [[Faramir]], and the Witch-king intercepts them. Unlike in the book, this meeting decisively favors the Witch-king, who breaks Gandalf's staff and throws the wizard to the ground before leaving to deal with the arrival of the [[Rohirrim]].  Gandalf's face shows obvious fear in this scene, in comparison to the resolution (for "victory or death") in the books.

:The Witch-king's final stand on the battlefield occurs with less dialogue than in the book, and the weapons used to defeat him are both mundane: Merry's sword is not a [[Daggers of Westernesse|dagger]] from the [[Barrow-downs]], but rather the Rohirric sword that [[Théoden]] had as a child. This does makes it somewhat confusing in the film whether the Witch-King was truly destroyed in this fight (as he was in the book), or whether we was temporarily incapacitated (as at the ford of Bruinen) and later perished along with his fellow Nazgul due to the One Ring's destruction.

:Eight actors are known to have played some part of the Witch-king.
#An unidentified extra portrayed the "King of Men" in the prologue. He was chosen to be the Witch-king simply because he was the smallest of the nine.
#[[Shane Rangi]] did the horse chase.
#[[Fran Walsh]] provided the "Ringwraith scream".
#Effects technician Ben Price played the Witch-king in "many scenes"<ref>http://www.decipher.com/content/2004/07/072904lotrwetaprops.html</ref>
#[[Brent McIntyre]] is officially credited as the Witch-king in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]''. He stabbed Frodo.
#[[Lawrence Makoare]] filled the robe of the Witch-king in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]''.
#[[Mark Ferguson]] filled the heavy armoured costume when Makoare felt claustrophobic.<ref>http://www.markferguson.net/articles/interview_Nautilus20.html</ref>
#[[Andy Serkis]] provided the voice of the Witch-king in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.

'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:'''
:The Witch-king is mentioned to have been defeated years ago, and his body sealed by the "Men of the North" in a very deep and dark tomb in the "[[High Fells of Rhudaur]]". His [[wraith]], apparently summoned by the [[Sauron#Sauron's Return|Necromancer]], is encountered by [[Radagast]] in the ruins of [[Dol Guldur]], but the [[Wizards|Wizard]] fends him off and salvages the Witch-king's [[Morgul-knife|Morgul blade]] in the struggle.

:In the [[Attack on Dol Guldur]], The Witch-King, along with the other Nazgûl, participates by fighting [[Saruman]] and [[Elrond]], members of the [[White Council]]. In the end, he and the other Nine are driven back to [[Mordor]] by [[Galadriel]] and her [[Phial of Galadriel|phial]], [[Sauron|his master]] also eventually following suit.

:No actor is known to have played the Witch-king in this film series.

===Tabletop Games===
'''1987: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]—[[Lords of Middle-earth: Vol. II]]''''' 
:[[Iron Crown Enterprises]] constructed an elaborate non-[[canon]]ical backstory for the Witch-king. In their interpretation, he was born during a solar eclipse in {{SA|1820}} in [[Andúnië]], leading to his mother naming him Tindomul ([[Quenya|Q.]] ''Twilight Son''). In [[Adûnaic]], his black hair led him to be called Er-Mûrazôr (''Black Prince''). As the second son of [[Tar-Ciryatan]] and younger brother to [[Tar-Atanamir|Atanamir]], he eventually grew jealous of his sibling. He sailed to Middle-earth in {{SA|1880}} with a small fleet, hoping to establish his own empire. He failed to establish a foothold in [[Lond Daer]], and journeyed southward to [[Umbar]], where he took control and proclaimed himself king. After only a few months, he was rebuked by his father and ordered to return to Númenor. Mûrazôr refused, but fled Umbar out of fear of his father’s wrath. 

:In Barad-dûr, Sauron took the prince under his wing in the first week of {{SA|1883}}. For 115 years he studied the Black Arts and became Sauron’s most trusted lieutenant. To reward his expertise, Sauron gave him a Ring of Power in {{SA|1998}}, after which he became known as the Witch-king and Lord of Morgul. During Sauron's capture by [[Ar-Pharazôn]], the Witch-king was in charge of Mordor, operating from the shadows to evade the eyes of Men. After the [[Downfall of Númenor]], he fought in the [[War of the Last Alliance]], but passed into the shadows when his master was defeated.

:The Witch-king reappeared around {{TA|1050}}, joining his master in [[Dol Guldur]] where he remained for two and a half centuries, formulating a plan for the destruction of [[Arnor]]. In {{TA|1300}}, he flew to a high plain overlooking the northeast of Arnor, where he founded the kingdom of Angmar and established his cavern-fortress of Carn Dûm. In the following centuries he fought and subjugated the three successor kingdoms of Arnor, until his own realm fell to Gondor.

:The Witch-king wore his father's Sea-helm, with a simple iron crown set into the crest, and had fashioned a suit of “Morgul Plate” armour with the same sort of Sea-drake skin. He wielded several weapons in addition to his [[Morgul-knife]]:<ref name=ICE>{{ICE|8003}}, pp. 98-102</ref>
* ''Vasamacil'' ([[Quenya|Q.]] “Blade-eater”, [[Sindarin|S.]] ''Vasamegil''), a flaming [[Metals_in_Middle-earth_Role_Playing#Ithilnaur|black ithilnaur]] broadsword, inlaid with ruby veins and its pommel topped with a ruby. It was forged in [[Thangorodrim]] by Sauron.<ref>{{ICE|2010}}, pp. 48</ref>
* ''Nallagurth'' (“Death's Proclaimer”), a [[Metals_in_Middle-earth_Role_Playing#Eog|black eog]] mace inlaid with diamond veins, with an enchanted black tip. It was forged in [[Utumno]] by Sauron.<ref>{{ICE|2010}}, pp. 38</ref>
* ''Romoquenáro'' (“Fiery Envoy”), a Númenórean steel composite bow. It has a black eog grip and is strung with whale sinew. It was likely a family heirloom.<ref>{{ICE|2010}}, pp. 42</ref>
===Video Games===

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:The Witch-king is shown without distinction of the other Nazgûl.

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' (video game)]]'':'''
:The Witch-king's role and voice are similar to that of the film, but his appearance is different. An early helmet design, that had been removed from the film because it resembled [[Sauron]]'s helm too much, was used here, presumably because there was no time to make a new character model.

'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring]]'':'''
:Witch-King is one the main "Hero" units for the Servants of Sauron, his signature ability is being able to turn Wights into Nazgûl. The evil campaign storyline shows him reclaiming Dol Guldur for Sauron.

'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'':'''
:Witch-King is a "Hero" unit for Mordor faction. He is an airborne unit riding on a Fell Beast and one of the strongest units in the game.

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:In addition to his appearance from the first game, the Witch-King can now also dismount and become a landscape unit armed with a mace. An expansion was released for this game the same year, titled [[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king]]. In this expansion, the campaign is centered around the Witch-King and his rise to power in Angmar.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The Witch-king is a non-playable character present in several scenes. His most memorable appearance takes place in the Great Barrow within the Barrow-Downs. There are also multiple references to him in quest dialogue, the most notable is that the Witch-King for whatever reason cannot return to rule [[Carn Dum]] and instead has erected a Steward named [[Mordirith]] to rule in his place, in mockery of the Stewards of Gondor.

'''2009: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'':'''
:In the campaign for the "Evil" side, the Witch-King is revived by other Nazgûl right before Sauron reclaims The One Ring.

''''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''
:The Witch-king appears in a flashback of the playable characters during the prologue of the game. He and the other [[Nazgûl]] attack and destroy the [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]] camp at [[Sarn Ford]]. Shortly after he speaks with [[Agandaûr]], who explains that he has assembled an army in [[Fornost]]. The Witch-king commands him to return and attack immediately, to aid in the [[Hunt of the Ring]].<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], ''Prologue''</ref>

'''2012: ''[[Guardians of Middle-earth]]'':'''
:The Witch-King is a playable defender. He is equipped with a flail and specialises in controlling effects. His ''Death'' ability causes damage, reduces enemy healing and reanimates a fallen enemy to fight for him. ''Darkness'' forces an enemy to turn back and fight, preventing escape and reflecting damage. ''Malice''  causes Damage in area and improves his next attack. ''Despair''  slows a targeted Enemy and nearby Enemies.

''''2017: ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]]'':'''
:The Witch-king is featured in the game. Voiced by Matthew Mercer, he serves as the main antagonist of the game. At the bidding of Sauron, he leads the siege on the city of Minas Ithil, making an adversary out of [[Talion]], in whom he takes a particular interest. Ensnaring General Castamir by promising the safety of his daughter, Idril, the Witch-king conquers the city for the Dark Lord. Using a [[palantír]] within Minas Ithil - now Minas Morgul - he sees that [[Celebrimbor]]'s New Ring is in [[Shelob]]'s hands. The Witch-king reveals what he has learned to his master, who rewards his allegiance with the reins of Minas Morgul and sends him to retrieve the New Ring.<ref>[[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]], ''Prologue''</ref>
