'''Grond''', called the Hammer of the Underworld, was [[Morgoth]]'s mighty mace that he bore when he fought [[Fingolfin]] before the doors of [[Angband]]. Each time Grond struck the ground it shook the land like a bolt of thunder, creating pits from which smoke and fire erupted. However, Fingolfin evaded these lumbering strokes like a flash of lightning; he only fell when he grew weary and Morgoth was able to "set his left foot upon his neck, and the weight of it was like a fallen hill".<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> 

Much later during the [[Third Age]], [[Sauron]] constructed a great battering ram, also called "[[Grond (battering ram)|Grond]]", designed solely to crush through the mighty gates of [[Minas Tirith]]. Named after his former master's weapon, this ram, powered by the [[Witch-king]], broke the city gates in four strokes.<ref>{{RK|Siege}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Grond'' means "very weighty and ponderous" in [[Sindarin]].<ref>{{PE|17}}, pp. 99, 183</ref>
