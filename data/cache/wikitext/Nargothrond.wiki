{{Quote|Thus [[Finrod]] came to the Caverns of Narog, and began to establish there deep halls and armouries after the fashion of the mansions of [[Menegroth]]; and that stronghold was called Nargothrond.|''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', "[[Of Beleriand and Its Realms]]"}}

'''Nargothrond''' was the stronghold built by [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] which delved into the banks of the river [[Narog]] in [[Beleriand]].

Nargothrond was the capital of the '''realm of Nargothrond'''<Ref group=note>The name appears only in the map accompanying ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. In the text, the realm is mentioned with minuscule letters.</ref> between [[Nenning]], Narog and [[Teiglin]], including the surrounding hills of [[Taur-en-Faroth]] and the [[Talath Dirnen]] to the north, as well as [[Tumhalad]]. Finrod was the overlord of all the [[Elves]] in the [[West Beleriand]], except the [[Falathrim]].<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref><ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>

==History==
===Building===
[[File:Anke Eißmann - Finrod listens to the counsel of Ulmo.jpg|thumb|right|''Finrod listens to the counsel of Ulmo'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]
After the return of the [[Noldor]] to [[Middle-earth]], [[Finrod]] and his brothers were established on north Beleriand with [[Fingolfin]]. In {{FA|50}},<ref>{{GA|74}}</ref> he was visited in [[Tol Sirion]] by his cousin [[Turgon]] from [[Nevrast]]; both travelled together southward to Beleriand. While resting in the [[Meres of Twilight]], [[Ulmo]] went to them and laid upon them a deep sleep and disturbing dreams. None told the other about his dreams, but both cousins began a search for hidden places in case [[Morgoth]] broke the [[Siege of Angband]].<ref name=return>{{S|Return}}</ref>

In {{FA|52}}, Finrod, who had now been a long guest of [[Thingol]], marvelled at [[Menegroth]] and shared with Thingol his dreams and desire to make for himself a place in like manner. Thingol then told Finrod of caves under the [[High Faroth]] on west-bank of [[Narog]], which few knew of, and provided him guides to lead him there.<ref>{{GA|75}}</ref> As Finrod came upon the Narog rushing down its steep course under the hills’ shadow, he resolved to make there a secret fortress and store-houses against evil days. In the far banks he saw the opening of many caves, and dwelling within were [[Petty-dwarves]], the remnant of a once more numerous people who still lingered there<ref name="foundnargo">{{NM|P3vii}}</ref> and had in their language named this region ''"[[Nulukkizdîn]]"''.<ref>{{WJ|Last}}</ref>{{rp|243}}

In this place Finrod carried out his designs in establishing great mansions, and in this labour he had at first help from the Petty-dwarves, for which he rewarded them generously.<ref name="foundnargo" /> In {{FA|102}} Nargothrond was fully-wrought and a feast was held which Finrod's brothers and Galadriel joined.<ref>{{GA|108}}</ref>

In {{FA|150}} the [[Dwarves of the Blue Mountains]] resumed their trafficking into Beleriand following their meeting and subsequent alliance with Finrod's cousin [[Caranthir]].<ref>{{GA|114}}</ref> Finrod had further help from these Great Dwarves in extending his underground fortress, but these Great Dwarves despised the Petty-dwarves, and had no compunction in ousting them, especially for great reward.<ref name="shibboleth">{{PM|Shibboleth}}</ref>{{rp|434}} [[Mîm]], the chieftain of the Petty-dwarves, thus developed a special hatred for the Elves, and attempted to murder Finrod in his sleep; this failed though, and he was driven out into the wild.<ref name="foundnargo" />

Finrod was skilled in lighter stone-carving and himself cut many of the adornments of the pillars and walls in Nargothrond.<ref name="shibboleth" />{{rp|434}} From this dwelling, and his work on it, he was given the epithet ''"[[Felagund]]"''.<ref group=note>Multiple etymologies are given for this name</ref>

Among the other developments of Nargothrond, Finrod also raised an artificial hill, [[Amon Ethir]], a league far from its gates.<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>

===Days of power===
Finrod ruled Nargothrond until he joined [[Beren]] in his quest for the [[Silmarils|Silmaril]] and handed rule to [[Orodreth]]. However, since the [[Dagor Bragollach]] [[Celegorm]] and [[Curufin]], the sons of [[Fëanor]], were defeated and retreated to Nargothrond where they were received as one of them. Although the city grew stronger because of this, the influence of the sons of Feänor became higher. Celegorm and Curufin lived in Nargothrond at the time Finrod departed with Beren and were more powerful than Orodreth until Finrod's death was reported, at which time they were exiled.

===Fall===
[[File:Elena Kukanova - Nargothrond - Turin and Finduilas.jpg|thumb|left|''Nargothrond - Turin and Finduilas'' by [[Elena Kukanova]]]]
{{Main|Sack of Nargothrond}}

[[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]] later came to Nargothrond and became one of its chief fighters, but he also persuaded the people to fight openly against Morgoth (the [[Bridge of Nargothrond|bridge]] was built at this time), which eventually led to its sack by the army of the dragon [[Glaurung]].

===Legacy===
[[Glaurung]] stayed there for about five more years guarding his stolen hoard until he went northeast to [[Brethil]] to assail Túrin and was killed by him at [[Cabed-en-Aras]]. Then, [[Mîm]] the Petty-dwarf settled there reclaiming his people's ancient home until he was killed by [[Húrin]]. Húrin entered the dark caves where the treasures Finrod brought from [[Valinor]] still lay there, but he brought out the [[Nauglamir]].<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref>

The realm remained deserted for the rest of the First Age until the [[War of Wrath]] when it went down with the rest of Beleriand. Ages later, the realm will be remembered in Dwarven lore<ref>{{FR|II4}}, "[[The world was young, the mountains green,]]"</ref> and mentioned by Galadriel.<ref>{{FR|II7}}, "...for ere the fall of Nargothrond or Gondolin I passed over the mountains..."</ref>

==Etymology==
From its first conception, the name '''''Nargothrond''''' means "Underground fortress on the river [[Narog]]". Its [[Petty-dwarves|Petty-dwarvish]] name was '''''[[Nulukkizdîn|Nulukkhizdîn]]''''' (erronously spelled ''Nulukkizdîn'' in the published works).<ref>{{WJ|10}}</ref>

However, in his later life, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] devised the Dwarvish name '''''Nar(u)kathan''''' instead, to which the Elves suffixed ''-[[rond]]'', "vaulted dome".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 47</ref>

In [[Eriol]]'s [[Old English]] translations, Nargothrond is referred as ''Hlydingaburg'' "City of the Hlydingas" or ''Stangaldor(burg)''.<ref>{{SM|QA1}}</ref>
