'''Richard "Dick" Plotz''' ([[1948]] - [[2024]])<ref name=obit>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/richard-plotz-obituary?id=54532878|articlename=Richard Plotz Obituary|dated=|website=4 March 2024|accessed=5 March 2024}}</ref> was the founder of the [[Tolkien Society of America]].

==Biography==
Plotz became involved in the [[Fandom|Tolkien community]] in the 1960s. In [[1965]] he formed the [[Tolkien Society of America]] (Which merged with the [[Mythopoeic Society]] in [[1972]]).<ref name=obit/><ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=https://www.mythsoc.org/about.htm|articlename=About the Society|dated=|website=[https://www.mythsoc.org/ Mythopeoic Society]|accessed=6 March 2024}}</ref> He says it began after he saw writing in [[Elvish]] on the wall of a subway station. He responded back in Elvish and became part of a conversation in Elvish written on various subway station walls. After becoming curious as to who was doing the writing he wrote the date and location of the first Tolkien Society meeting. Early attendees of these meetings include [[W.H. Auden]] and [[Deborah Rogers]].<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ByEsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xp0FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1021%2C4717932 Dick Plotz about Tolkien Society foundation]</ref><ref name=obitbratman>{{webcite|author=[[David Bratman]]|articleurl=https://kalimac.blogspot.com/2024/03/obituary-richard-plotz.html|articlename=obituary: Richard Plotz|dated=5 March 2024|website=|accessed=6 March 2024}}</ref>
