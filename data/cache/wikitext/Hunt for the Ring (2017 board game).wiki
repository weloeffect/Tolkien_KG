'''Hunt for the Ring''' is a hidden movement/deduction game published by [[ARES Games]] in 2017, retelling the journey of [[Frodo]] and the [[Hobbits]] as they make their way to [[Rivendell]] with [[The One Ring]], as told in the [[The Fellowship of the Ring]].

==From the publisher==
The game is a battle of wits and takes you upon a new journey across Middle–earth. One player must bring Frodo Baggins — the [[Ringbearer]] — and his Hobbit friends from their home in the [[Shire]] to the sanctuary of Rivendell, where the fate of the One Ring will be decided. Using secrecy and the help of powerful allies, the Ringbearer must escape the chase of the [[Nazgûl]], the terrible Ringwraiths, controlled by up to four other players. The Ringwraith players work together to find Frodo and recover the Ring for their [[Sauron|Dark Lord]], while the Ringbearer secretly tracks his path first from [[Hobbiton]] to [[Bree]], then from Bree to Rivendell, on a double–sided game board.
