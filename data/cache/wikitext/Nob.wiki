{{quote|Hi! Nob! ... Where are you, you wolly-footed slow-coach?|[[Barliman Butterbur]]<ref name="Sign">{{FR|Sign}}</ref>}}
'''Nob''' was a [[Hobbits|hobbit]] of [[Bree]].

==History==
Nob lived at the end of the [[Third Age]] and probably the beginning of the [[Fourth Age|Fourth]]. He worked for [[Barliman Butterbur]] at ''[[The Prancing Pony]]'' with [[Bob]], where he served food and tended to any other needs guests might have. 

On [[29 September|September 29]], {{TA|3018}},<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> [[Travellers|four Shire-hobbits]] came to ''The Prancing Pony''.<ref name="Sign" /> When one of them, [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]], went missing after a night stroll, Nob found him near the house of [[Bill Ferny]].<ref name="Strider">{{FR|Strider}}</ref> Realizing the [[Nazgûl|danger]], Nob helped the Hobbits to disguise their beds, and kept watch at night. Nonetheless, the Inn was attacked.<ref name="Knife">{{FR|Knife}}</ref> 

When those four hobbits returned on [[28 October|October 28]] [[Third Age 3019|the following year]],<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref> Nob still worked at ''The Prancing Pony''.<ref>{{RK|Homeward}}</ref>

==Etymology==
In historical English ''nob'' is slang to denote disrespect for a high society person, cf. ''knob'' "head".<ref>[[Jim Allan]] (ed.), ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', Giving of names</ref>

[[Wayne G. Hammond|Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull|Scull]] think that ''Nob'' was perhaps chosen rhyme with ''Bob'', and that it does not appear to be recognized diminutive or nickname.<ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond]], [[Christina Scull]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', page 151</ref> It is also possible that ''Nob'' was a nickname of a person named Robert; Tolkien's review of M. Förster's ''Die Französierung des englischen Personennamenschatzes'' mentions the name ''Nob'' in one line with better known names as ''[[Hob Hayward|Hob]]'' and ''Rob''.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], "Philology: General works", published in ''[[The Year's Work in English Studies]]'', vol. 6 (edited by Boas and Hereford), pages 32-66, esp 39</ref>
