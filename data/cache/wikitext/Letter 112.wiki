==Summary==
Katharine Farrer, a mystery writer and neighbour of Tolkien had apparently asked for her copy of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' to be signed. Instead, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] wrote her a note in [[Runes]]. In the letter, Tolkien thanks her for her request, and tells her he is glad ''The Hobbit'' is obtainable again (most stores had run out). He tells her of "[[The Lord of the Rings|the next book]]", and how it will contain [[Appendix E|more information]] about the alphabets.
