'''Muzgash''' was an [[Orcs|orc]] serving in the garrison of the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]], under the command of [[Shagrat]]. He was caught up in fighting with [[Gorbag]]'s [[Minas Morgul|Morgul]]-[[orcs]] in the Tower; with [[Lagduf]], he attempted to escape, but was shot as he ran through the gate.<ref>{{RK|VI1}}</ref>

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'''''
: Though unidentified, a trio of Uruk-hai are encountered by Samwise Gamgee on the stairs of the tower after the battle. Since only one Uruk ([[Snaga (Orc of Mordor)|Snaga]]) was encountered by Sam on the stairs in the novel, it is likely that the other two are meant to be [[Lagduf]] and Muzgash.
