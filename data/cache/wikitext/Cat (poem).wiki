'''''Cat''''' is a poem written by [[Sam Gamgee]] and recorded in the [[Red Book of Westmarch]], although at most he only touched up an older piece. [[Hobbits]] appear to have been fond of comic bestiary lore, of which this is an example.<ref>{{AB|Preface}}</ref>

The poem contains two stanzas composed of alternating longer and shorter lines. It relies on assonance, the refrain of vowel sounds, to create internal rhyming.

[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] wrote the poem for his [[Joan Anne Tolkien|granddaughter]] in [[1956]].<ref>{{AB|Intro}}</ref> He apparently made use in the poem of a device found in medieval bestiaries (several such manuscripts are kept by the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford]]): the pairing of [[lions]] and [[pards]].<ref>"[http://bestiary.ca/beasts/beast116.htm Pard]" at [http://bestiary.ca/ The Medieval Bestiary] (accessed 12 March 2011)</ref>

It was published as the twelfth poem in ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'' (1962).<ref>{{AB|Cat}}</ref> The poem has also been published separately in the anthology ''[[The Poetical Cat]]'' (1995).

The fat cat on the mat
   may seem to dream
of nice mice that suffice
   for him, or cream;
but he free, maybe,</poem>
