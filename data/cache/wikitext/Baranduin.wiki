{{quote|And no wonder they're queer, ... if they live on the wrong side of the Brandywine River, and right agin the Old Forest. That's a dark bad place, if half the tales be true.|[[Daddy Twofoot]] in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', "[[A Long-expected Party]]"}}

The '''Baranduin''' was a river in [[Eriador]]. To the [[Hobbits]] of [[the Shire]], the '''Brandywine''' (as they called it) was the boundary between the known and unknown, and even those who lived in [[Buckland]] on the immediate opposite shore were considered "peculiar".

==History==
[[Elendil]]'s [[Arnorians|people]] dwelt about the course of the Baranduin.<ref>{{s|Rings}}</ref>

After the realm of [[Arnor]] was broken up in {{TA|861}}, the river south of the [[Brandywine Bridge]] served as part of the border between [[Arthedain]] and [[Cardolan]].<ref>{{App|A1iii}}</ref>

When [[the Shire]] was founded, the river was its eastern border. In {{TA|2340}} [[Gorhendad Oldbuck]] crossed the river and founded [[Brandy Hall]], and Baranduin now separated the [[Eastfarthing]] from [[Buckland]].

[[Primula Brandybuck|Primula]] and [[Drogo Baggins]], parents of [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], were lost along the river in a boating accident in {{TA|2980}}. As of {{TA|3018}}, [[Merry Brandybuck]] knew of no instances in which horses had crossed the river by swimming.

==Course==
Flowing out of [[Lake Evendim]] in northern [[Eriador]], the river flowed eastward for about 60 miles before turning generally southward; after about another 120 miles it flowed through the easternmost reaches of the Shire, forming that land's eastern border, except for [[Buckland]], which lies east of it. Its only major crossings in the Shire are the [[Brandywine Bridge]] (originally ''Bridge of Stonebows'') on the [[East Road]] and the [[Bucklebury Ferry]]. The [[Girdley Island]] is  just above the Brandywine Bridge.

Skirting the [[Old Forest]] to the south, the river then looped south-westward, crossing an old road at [[Sarn Ford]] and flowed to the north of the depopulated region of [[Minhiriath]] before flowing into the [[Belegaer|Sea]] to the north of the forested region of [[Eryn Vorn]].

==Tributaries==
No tributares of the Baranduin are described except those near or in the Shire:
* [[The Water]] - central Shire, from the northwest
* The [[Stock-brook]] - arises in the Woody End
* River [[Shirebourn]] - rises in Green-Hill country, tributary is Thistle Brook
* [[Withywindle]] - from the Old Forest
* River [[Norbourn]] - in the [[Farthings|Northfarthing]]

==Etymology==
The name ''Baranduin'' was [[Sindarin]] for "golden-brown river", from ''[[baran (Sindarin)|baran]]'' and ''[[duin]]''.<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, pp. 765-6</ref>

==Other names==
The [[Hobbits]] of the Shire originally gave it the punning name '''''Branda-nîn''''', meaning "border water" in original [[Hobbitish]] [[Westron]]. This was later punned again as ''[[Bralda-hîm]]'' meaning "heady ale" (referring to the colour of its water), which Tolkien renders into English as '''''Brandywine'''''.<ref name="AppF">{{App|F2}}</ref>

The word ''Brandywine'' both resembles the original Elvish name ''Baranduin'', and provides the Hobbitish meaning adequately.

The word ''[[Wiktionary:brandywine|brandywine]]'' was actually the archaic English word for [[Wikipedia:brandy|brandy]] as imported from the Dutch ''[[Wiktionary:brandewijn|brandewijn]]''. [[David Salo]] noted that it represents a possible [[Old English]] *''baernedwin'', meaning "burned wine", which would resemble quite closely the original Elvish ''Baranduin'',<ref>{{webcite|author=[[David Salo]]|articleurl=https://tolkienlistsearch.herokuapp.com/message/5e9c35b63ee6a6c41e9862d6|articlename=Hobbitish Place-names (1.21)|dated=23 November 1998|website=[[Elfling]]|accessed=2022-09-23}}</ref> making [[Hobbitish]] ''Brandywine'' a legitimate corruption of S. ''Baranduin''.

==Portrayal in adaptations==

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The flow of Baranduin can be followed from its source through [[Sarn Ford]]. The river flows out of [[Lake Evendim]] at the "High King's Crossing", an [[Arnor]]ian stone bridge with a towering colossus statue. It is joined by river Núrsir flowing out from [[North Downs]] and passes through the sandy beaches of Barandalf before coming within the borders of [[the Shire]]. Above the [[Girdley Island]] it is joined the stream flowing out of the Lake Starmere in [[Bree-land]]. Past the [[Old Forest]], Baranduinflows through the in-game region of [[Cardolan]], with a series of rapids creating an impassable barrier at its borders.
