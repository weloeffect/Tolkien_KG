== Trivia ==
Below is a list of trivia from Amazon's "X-Ray" feature that accompanied the episode.
* Scene 2 - "Most of the details and elaborations told herein are derived from '[[The Lord of the Rings]]', its prologue entitled '[[Concerning Hobbits]]', and its [[Appendices]], [[Appendix A|A]] through [[Appendix F|F]], where the intrepid traveler may journey to discover even farther horizons."

== Production ==

== Differences ==
All these events that happen and have to do about [[Mount Doom|Orodruin]] (eruption, destruction of [[Tirharad]] e.t.c.) never happen in any of Tolkien's books.
