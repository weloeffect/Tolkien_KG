'''''Bilbo's Last Song (at the Grey Havens)''''' is a poem written by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. It is sung by [[Bilbo Baggins]] at the [[Grey Havens]] as he is about to leave [[Middle-earth]]. Chronologically this places it at the very end of ''[[The Return of the King]]'', the last volume of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', although it was written later than the books and never included in them.

The poem first appeared as posters (60×40&nbsp;cm) in November [[1974]], illustrated by [[Pauline Baynes]], published by Allen & Unwin.

The first book edition was published in [[1990]], illustrated by the same artist. It is a 32-page full colour picture-book, each double page containing two lines of the poem, with almost fifty of Baynes's paintings.

The poem was included in the second edition of ''[[The Road Goes Ever On (book)|The Road Goes Ever On]]'', set to music by [[Donald Swann]], in [[1978]].

==Background==
It was originally a composition in Old Norse, entitled ''Vestr um haf'' ("West over sea"), written as early as 1920s. In [[1968]], after [[Joy Hill]], Tolkien's secretary, rediscovered it in a pile of books, Tolkien gave it to her as a gift for her assistance in the setting up of his new office.

After Tolkien's death in [[1973]], Hill showed the poem to [[Donald Swann]], who liked the poem so much that he set it to music and included it in the second edition of ''[[The Road Goes Ever On (book)|The Road Goes Ever On]]'' in [[1978]].<ref>{{RGEO|Bilbo}}</ref> The poem was also illustrated by [[Pauline Baynes]], and published as a poster on [[26 November]] [[1974]]. 

The song was included in the BBC Radio 4 adaptation of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (1981), with music by Stephen Oliver. The first verse is chanted by John Le Mesurier as Bilbo, the second omitted, and the third sung by a boy soprano.

In 1996 the song was recorded by the [[Unquendor|Dutch Tolkien Society]] band [[The Hobbitons]], with permission from the [[Tolkien Estate]], for their CD ''J.R.R. Tolkien's Songs from Middle-earth''.<ref>{{webcite|website=[http://web.archive.org/web/20021210152658/http://home.wxs.nl/~hobbiton/home.html The Hobbitons] (via [http://www.archive.org Internet Archive]) |articlename=Our CD|articleurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20021207123849/home.wxs.nl/~hobbiton/OURCD.HTM|accessed=27 May 2014}}</ref>

The copyright of the poem was given by Tolkien to Hill together with the poem itself. Upon her death in 1991, Hill gave the copyright to the [[Wikipedia:Order of the Holy Paraclete|Order of the Holy Paraclete]]. Baynes's illustrations for ''Bilbo's Last Song'' were not included in the bequeathing to the Order, but were given the [[Wikipedia:Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford|Williams-Exeter Programme at Oxford]] upon her death in 2008.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Wayne G.

==The poem==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
'''Bilbo's Last Song'''
<small>(At the Grey Havens)</small>

Day is ended, dim my eyes,
but journey long before me lies.
Farewell, friends! I hear the call.
The ship's beside the stony wall.
Foam is white and waves are grey;
beyond the sunset leads my way.
Foam is salt, the wind is free;
I hear the rising of the Sea.

Farewell, friends! The sails are set,
the wind is east, the moorings fret.
Shadows long before me lie,
beneath the ever-bending sky,
but islands lie behind the Sun
that I shall raise ere all is done;
lands there are to west of West,
where night is quiet and sleep is rest.

Guided by the Lonely Star,
beyond the utmost harbour-bar
I'll find the havens fair and free,
and beaches of the Starlit Sea.
Ship, my ship! I seek the West,
and fields and mountains ever blest.
Farewell to Middle-Earth at last.
I see the Star above your mast!
</poem>
