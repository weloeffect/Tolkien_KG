'''Dodinas Brandybuck''' was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of [[the Shire]].

==History==
Dodinas was the fourth child of [[Gorbadoc Brandybuck]] and [[Mirabella Took]], born between {{SR|1308}} and {{SR|1313}}. He seems to have died before {{SR|1401}} as he was not present at [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo's]] [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|Farewell Party]].<ref>{{App|Brandybuck}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The meaning of the name ''Dodinas'' is unknown. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] noted that the names of the Bucklanders had a vaguely [[Celtic]] style.<ref name="Translation">{{App|Translation}}, p. 1135</ref>

In Malory's ''Le Morte Darthur'' a Knight of the Round Table is called ''Dodynas le Saveage''. In editions with modernized spelling he is called ''Dodinas''. He is called ''Doddinaual de Sauage'' in ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (poem)|Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]''.<ref>{{HM|IE}}, "Giving of Names", "The Celtic-sounding Names", p. 202</ref>
