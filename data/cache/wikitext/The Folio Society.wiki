==Editions==
===The Hobbit (1976)===
This is the first release from The Folio Society of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s works. Some copies erroneously reference [[George Allen & Unwin]] on the title page instead of The Folio Society. According to [[Wayne G. Hammond]], this occurred due to the imprint being identical to the George Allen & Unwin release, and the first few pages were supposed to be replaced with a reference to The Folio society.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Descriptive Bibliography]], pg. 52</ref>

===The Lord of the Rings (1997-Present)===
[[File:The Folio Society - The Lord of the Rings (1997).webp|thumb|The Lord of the Rings, 1997-Present]]
{{blockquote|Eric Fraser was one of the foremost British illustrators of the 20th century. His images – a total of seven full-page images and 57 head-pieces – are based on original designs by Queen Margrethe II of Denmark. Tolkien had seen her sketches and was so impressed that his executors gave special permission for Fraser to interpret them for these Folio editions. Covers blocked in gold and maps of Middle Earth as endpapers complete this superb edition of one the world’s favourite stories.|The Folio society}}
