'''Gilmith''' was the daughter of [[Imrazôr]], a man of [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] descent, and [[Mithrellas]], a [[Silvan Elves|Silvan]] [[Elves|Elf]]-maiden who accompanied [[Nimrodel]] before getting lost. Imrazôr took Mithrellas in. They married and had two children, Gilmith and [[Galador]]. Mithrellas later ran away and was never seen again. Galador would later become the first [[Prince of Dol Amroth]].<ref>{{UT|Amroth}}, p. 248</ref><ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, The Line of Dol Amroth, pp. 220-2</ref>

== Etymology ==
''Gilmith'' is probably a [[Sindarin]] name. Its meaning and components are not glossed, but it perhaps means "Grey Star" and is a compound of ''[[gil]]'' ("star") and ''[[mith]]'' ("grey").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-1790422249.html|articlename=S.
