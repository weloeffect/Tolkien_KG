'''Calmacil''' ({{TA|1058}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> – {{TA|1304|n}},<ref name="South">{{App|South}}</ref> aged 246 years) was the eighteenth King of [[Gondor]].

==History==
Calmacil was the son of King [[Atanatar II]] Alcarin and younger brother of the later King [[Narmacil I|Narmacil]]. The two brothers had inherited their father's love for ease and neglect of political matters. 

His older brother Narmacil succeeded their father to the throne, but was indolent and had no children. Calmacil had a son, [[Minalcar]], who was unlike them, a man of great vigour, was bestowed by Narmacil to be a [[Regent of Gondor|Regent]].

When Narmacil died without heirs in {{TA|1294}}, his brother Calmacil succeeded him, but was too old to rule<ref name="South"/> so he continued to have his son Minalcar function as Regent<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref> until he was properly succeeded after his death.

==Etymology==
''Calmacil'' is [[Quenya]]. Its meaning is not glossed, but as Paul Strack explains it seems to mean "Sword of Light" or "Shining Sword" seems to be a compound of ''[[cala]]'' ("light") and ''[[macil]]'' ("sword").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-141190487.html|articlename=Q.
