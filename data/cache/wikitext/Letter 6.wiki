==Background==
[[Joseph Wright]], Tolkien's former philology Professor, wrote an article about ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]''. [[Elizabeth Mary Wright|His wife]] had sent Tolkien an offprint of that article.
==Summary==
Tolkien acknowledged its arrival with gratitude, and asked about her husband. He then told of his home situation: [[John Tolkien|John]] and [[Michael Tolkien|Michael]] first and then his wife and nursemaid had been ill with measles for most of January. 

In a postscript he informed her that philology was making progress at the [[University of Leeds]].
