'''Imrazôr''', known as the '''Númenórean''', was a [[Gondorians|Gondorian]] nobleman of [[Belfalas]] at the end of the second millennium of the [[Third Age]]. He was said to have wedded an [[Elves|Elf-maid]] named [[Mithrellas]], a wandering companion of [[Nimrodel]]. His son [[Galador]] was the first [[Prince of Dol Amroth]].<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}, ''Amroth and Nimrodel''</ref>

==Etymology==
The meaning of the name is not known, however it includes [[Adûnaic]] ''zôr'' which means "flame" or "foam".

The first element ''imra'' (perhaps from *''imar'') is not translated but it also appears in the name of his descendant, [[Imrahil]] and perhaps [[Imâr]].

Imrazôr, who seems to have retained the usage of Adûnaic in his House, was also known as the '''Númenórean'''. Why a Gondorian noble of the Third Age would be called the "Númenórean" is not made clear from the context.<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, ''The Line of Dol Amroth'', p. 220-222</ref>
