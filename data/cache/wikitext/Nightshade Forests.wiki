}}'''''Nightshade Forests''''' is the second track of the album [[Dol Guldur (album)|Dol Guldur]] by the band [[Summoning]]. The song name is taken from [[Taur-nu-Fuin (disambiguation)|Taur-nu-Fuin]], the name given to the forest of [[Dorthonion]] after it fell into darkness in the [[First Age]], and the dark forest of [[Mirkwood]] in the [[Third Age]]. Like the song [[Lugburz (song)|Lugburz]] from the album [[Minas Morgul (album)|Minas Morgul]], the lyrics directly reference the [[Cold be hand and heart and bone,|incantation]] chanted by a [[Barrow-wights|Barrow-wight]] who had trapped [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] in the [[Fog on the Barrow-downs]] chapter of [[The Fellowship of the Ring]].

==Lyrics==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
And in the glade a light was seen 
Of stars and shadows shimmering 
Immortal maiden elven-wise... 
Long was the way through iron halls and darkling doors 

And woods of nightshade morrowless 
Elven-wise dance with me... 
Cold be hand, heart and bone 
And cold be my sleep under stone 
Never more I'll wake on a snowy bed 
Never - 'til the sun fails and the moon is dead 

In the black winds the stars shall die 
And still on gold here let them lie 
'Til the dark lord lifts his hand 
Over dead seas and withered land 

And I'll fly away... 
Where I dwell none can say 
For into darkness fell my star 
In Mordor where the shadows are
</poem>
