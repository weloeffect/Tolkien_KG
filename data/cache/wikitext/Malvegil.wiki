'''Malvegil''' ({{TA|1144}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 193</ref> - {{TA|1349|n}},<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 205) was the sixth ruler of [[Arthedain]].

==History==
Malvegil was the son of [[Celebrindor]], and gained the kingship of [[Arthedain]] upon his father's death in {{TA|1272}}.<ref name="North"/>

It was during Malvegil's reign (c. {{TA|1300|n}}) that the [[Witch-king]] saw an opportunity in the disunion of the [[Arnorians]] and he went to the North and founded [[Angmar]].  To this realm were drawn evil men, [[Orcs]] (who begin attacking the [[Dwarves]]), and other fell creatures.  Due to the growing evils of the [[Misty Mountains]], [[Hobbits]] moved westward and many of them settled in [[Bree]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

Malvegil ruled Arthedain for seventy-seven years. He lived for two hundred and five years, longer than any of his descendants until [[Aragorn]]. He was succeeded by his son [[Argeleb I]] in {{TA|1349|n}}.<ref name="North"/>

== Etymology ==
''Malvegil'' is a [[Sindarin]] name. Its meaning is not glossed, but Paul Strack suggests it means "Sword of Gold" and is a combination of ''[[malt]]'' ("gold") and the lenited form of ''megil'' ("sword").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-2688282303.html|articlename=S.
