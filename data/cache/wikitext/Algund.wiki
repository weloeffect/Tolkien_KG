'''Algund''' was originally one of the people of [[Dor-lómin]] and had lived for a time under the lordship of [[Húrin|Húrin Thalion]]. At the time of the great battle of the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], Algund fled from his homeland, and travelled down the [[Vales of Sirion]]. Eventually, he fell in with a band of outlaws, the [[Gaurwaith]], who haunted the woodlands of [[Brethil]] on the western borders of Doriath. Algund was the oldest of the Gaurwaith.<ref name="Narn">{{UT|Narn}}, ''Túrin among the Outlaws''</ref><ref>{{CH|6}}, p. 99</ref>

Late in his life, Algund saw a new member join the band.  This was [[Túrin|Túrin Turambar]], Húrin's son, who had exiled himself from the land of his foster-father [[Thingol]].<ref name="Narn"/>  Túrin eventually came to lead the outlaws - when Túrin killed [[Forweg]], the previous captain, it was Algund who supported Túrin as "the best man among us" to replace the former leader.<ref>{{CH|6}}, p. 106</ref>  Later, when the outlaws captured [[Beleg]] when Túrin was absent, [[Andróg]] wished to kill him but Algund stayed his hand, saying that they should wait for Túrin.<ref>{{CH|6}}, p. 112</ref>  According to some versions of the tale, Algund was able to recognise the newcomer from his resemblance to his father.<ref>{{UT|Narn}}, note 10</ref> No record exists of Algund's fate: most likely, he was slain just a few years after the coming of Túrin, when the outlaws were ambushed by [[Orc]]s on the summit of [[Amon Rûdh]].
