'''Khamûl''' was one of the nine [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]], second only to the [[Witch-king]] himself, and since {{TA|2951}}<ref name=RC>{{HM|RC}}, "A Knife in the Dark", p. 167-9</ref> Sauron's lieutenant at [[Dol Guldur]]. He was also called "'''the Shadow of the East'''".<ref name=Black>{{UT|Black}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:Stephen Hickman - Gaffer Gamgee and the Black Rider.jpg|thumb|left|''Gaffer Gamgee and the Black Rider'' by [[Stephen Hickman]]]]
It is possible that Khamûl was an [[Easterlings|Easterling]].<ref group=note>The earlier byname "the Black Easterling" of a then unnamed Ringwraith at Dol Guldur and his later byname "the Shadow of the East" suggest that he was originally from the East, but the latter may also refer to the fact that he was based in Dol Guldur, which is in the East</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, "Khamul, commander of Dol Guldur, was from the East", p. 84</ref> Like the other Ringwraiths, he was one of nine [[Men]] to whom [[Sauron]] gave one of the [[Nine Rings|Rings of Power]], who became mighty kings, sorcerers or warriors, and eventually faded into a [[Wraiths|wraith]] that was under the rule of Sauron.<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref> By {{SA|2251}} he and the other eight Men who had received rings of power first appeared as Ringwraiths.<ref>{{App|SA}}, entry for the year 2251, p. 1083</ref>

After the Witch-king, Khamûl had the best ability to perceive the presence of [[the One Ring]], but his power was most confused and diminished by daylight.<ref name=Note1>{{UT|Hunt}}, Notes, note 1</ref>

In {{TA|2951}}, Sauron declared himself openly to his enemies and sent Khamûl and two other Ringwraiths to [[Dol Guldur]],<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2951, p. 1089</ref> with the former taking command.<ref name=Black/>

Around [[22 July]] {{TA|3018}}, Khamûl with another Ringwraith who lived at Dol Guldur met the Witch-king and six other Ringwraiths that lived at [[Minas Morgul]] in the [[Field of Celebrant]]. The Ringwraiths from Dol Guldur informed their fellow Ringwraiths from Minas Morgul that Gollum had escaped and vanished. Khamûl also told them that the villages of the [[Stoors]] at the river [[Gladden]] had been deserted for a long time and that it had not been possible to find a dwelling of [[Hobbits|Halflings]] in the [[Vales of Anduin]].<ref name=Black/>

In the evening of [[23 September]],<ref name=Great>{{App|Great}}, pp. 1091-2</ref> Khamûl arrived in [[Hobbiton]] and asked [[Hamfast Gamgee]] about "Baggins". Hamfast Gamgee misled him that Frodo Baggins had already left and he rode to the east. On [[24 September]], he rode on the [[Stock Road]] and overtook Frodo and stopped,<ref>{{FR|Three}}, p. 74</ref> because he sensed the Ring, but he was not certain because of the bright daylight and left again and waited until the night.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, citing from an unpublished version of ''The Hunt for the Ring'', p. 97</ref> After the sunset he sensed the ring again and pursued Frodo.<ref name=Hunt99>{{HM|RC}}, citing from an unpublished version of ''The Hunt for the Ring'', p. 99</ref> He did not dare to attack and retreated,<ref>{{FR|Three}}, p. 78</ref> because he was intimidated by the [[Elves]] and by the song about [[Elbereth]].<ref name=Hunt99/> He could not sense the ring clearly as long as Frodo was surrounded by the Elves.<ref name=Hunt99/>

After the departure of the Elves Khamûl continued to pursue Frodo, but did not find him and called the [[F|other Ringwraith]] from Dol Guldur to him with cries. He and another Ringwraith from Dol Guldur went east over the fields and Khamûl visited [[Farmer Maggot]].<ref>{{FR|Mushrooms}}, pp. 93-4</ref> After leaving farmer Maggot he sent his companion off to take the [[Causeway]] in the direction of the [[Overbourn Marshes]] and he went north in the direction of the [[Brandywine Bridge]]. He arrived too late at the [[Bucklebury Ferry]] in the night of [[25 September]].<ref name=RC164>{{HM|RC}}, citing from an unpublished version of ''The Hunt for the Ring'', pp. 164-5</ref>

After Frodo had left on the ferry Khamûl summoned the other four Ringwraiths who had entered the Shire with him. He ordered one to watch the Brandywine Bridge and sent two to ride east on the [[East Road]] and inform the Witch-king that the ring has moved east. Khamûl and another Ringwraith from Dol Guldur entered [[Buckland]] in secret through the [[Buckland Gate|north gate]].<ref name=RC164/> They searched the Buckland and arrived at Crickhollow in the night of [[28 September]]. Khâmul sent the other Ringwraith from Dol Guldur to collect the Ringwraith who guarded the Brandywine Bridge and the horses that they had left behind and waited. The three Ringwraiths then watch Crickhollow through the night until the next morning.<ref name=RC164/>

He was also one of the six Ringwraiths, led by the Witch King, that followed Gandalf on [[Shadowfax]] and attacked him on 3 October during the night during the night on [[Weathertop]],<ref name=Great/> but were repulsed after a violent fight in the early hours of 4 October, when [[Frodo]] and [[Aragorn]] saw the lights of that battle from their camp.<ref>{{FR|Knife}}, p. 183</ref><ref name=Hunt168>{{HM|RC}} citing from an unpublished version of ''The Hunt for the Ring'', p. 168</ref> The Witch King and Khamûl stayed behind to watch Weathertop (waiting for the Ring Bearer to come) for two days thereafter, along with two other Ringwraiths and sent four Ringwraiths to pursue Gandalf.<ref name=Hunt168/>

Khamûl and two other Ringwraiths<ref name=Hunt194>{{HM|RC}}, citing from an unpublished version of ''The Hunt for the Ring'', p. 194</ref> were on the bridge over the [[Hoarwell]] on [[11 October]],<ref name=Great/> but when [[Glorfindel]] approached them, they withdrew and were pursued by Glorfindel<ref>{{FR|Flight}}, p. 210</ref> down the road until they left the road and scattered.<ref name=Hunt194/> However on [[14 October]], Khamûl, the Witch-king and three other Ringwraiths assembled again and continued with their pursuit.<ref name=Hunt194/>

On [[20 October]],<ref name=Great/> he was among the Ringwraiths who caught up with Frodo and his companions and dared to use the ford to ride into the river [[Loudwater]] to pursue Frodo who had already crossed the river,<ref>{{HM|RC}}, citing from an unpublished version of ''The Hunt for the Ring'', p. 196</ref> but they were swept down the river by the flood<ref>{{FR|Flight}}, pp. 212-5</ref> that was called by [[Elrond]].<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}, p. 224</ref>

From [[20 March]] on,<ref name=Great1094>{{App|Great}}, p. 1094</ref> Khamûl and the other seven remaining Ringwraiths were flying on their [[Fell beasts]] over the [[Army of the West]] watching its movements as it marched to the [[Black Gate]].<ref>{{RK|Gate}}, "near the end of the second day of their march from the Cross-roads", p. 885</ref>

On [[25 March]],<ref name=Great1094/> Khamûl and all the other seven Ringwraiths were flying on their [[Fell beasts]] over the [[Army of the West]] during the [[Battle of the Morannon]].<ref>{{RK|Gate}}, p. 887</ref> When Frodo put on the ring at the [[Cracks of Doom]] in [[Mount Doom]] Sauron realised the danger and ordered Khâmul and the other Ringwraiths to race to Mount Doom. Khamûl probably perished with the rest of the Ringwraiths when they flew on their Fell beasts to Mount Doom and were caught in the fiery eruption of Mount Doom that took place after the destruction of the One Ring, because they "crackled, withered, and went out".<ref>{{RK|Doom}}, p. 946-7</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
The bynames "'''the Second Chief (the Black Easterling)'''" were used for an unnamed Ringwraith that was based in Dol Guldur in a rejected version of the passage about the earlier movements of the Ringwraiths in "The Hunt for the Ring", but not in the final version where the Ringwraith who was Sauron's lieutenant at Dol Guldur was named Khâmul the Shadow of the East.<ref name=Note1/>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
[[File:Liz Danforth - Khamûl the Easterling.jpeg|thumb|right|''“Khamûl the Easterling”'' by [[Liz Danforth]]]]
'''1987: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]—[[Lords of Middle-earth: Vol. II]]''''' 
:[[Iron Crown Enterprises]] constructed an elaborate non-[[canon]]ical backstory for Khamûl. In their interpretation, he was born as Komûl in {{SA|1744}} and was heir to the [[Womaw]] kingdom in the East. His mother died when he was young, and he was raised by his manipulative stepmother, an Elf named Dardarian. She instilled in him a constant longing for immortality.

:By {{SA|1994}}, Komûl's people faced increasing pressure from their distant Númenórean cousins, who were establishing trade and military outposts in the East. To counter this threat, Komûl turned to his stepmother, Dardarian, who was in secret a servant of Sauron. By {{SA|1996}}, Komûl had accepted her gift, a [[Nine Rings|Ring of Power]], and came under the Dark Lord's sway. Komûl was ultimately forced to abdicate a year later in favour of a Numenorean-supported faction led by his popular cousin.

:He resurfaced at Barad-dûr in {{SA|2000}}. From then on he was known as Khamûl.<ref group=note>Noted to be the Black Speech pronunciation of his given name.</ref> When Sauron was imprisoned by [[Ar-Pharazôn]], he fled to his mother's people, the Shay. After the [[Downfall of Númenor|Downfall]] he returned to Mordor, but passed into the shadows as Sauron was defeated during the [[War of the Last Alliance]].

:Khamûl reappeared around {{TA|1050}}, briefly residing with Sauron at Dol Guldur in Mirkwood. From there, he sought to gain influence over the peoples of southeastern Middle-earth, often working with [[Third of the Nazgûl|Dwar]] and contending with the [[Blue Wizards]]. During the [[Watchful Peace]], he lived at Minas Morgul but frequently traveled to Dol Guldur. During one of these visits, he captured [[Thráin]], taking his [[Seven Rings|Ring]] but failed to extract useful information from him.

:Khamûl wore a distinctive blue dragonhelm, and wielded several weapons in addition to his [[Morgul-knife]]:<ref name=ICE>{{ICE|8003}}, pp. 92-94</ref>
* ''Water-skimmer'', a Cuivac-wooden killing-[[Wikipedia:Bolas|bola]].<ref>{{ICE|2010}}, pp. 49</ref>
* ''Stinging Tongue'', a [[Mallorn]]-inlaid blowgun.<ref>{{ICE|2010}}, pp. 49</ref>

'''2001-: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game]]'':'''
:Khamûl received two named miniatures in the game, one depicting his cloaked form and the other his armored appearance as seen in ''The Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies''. The latter explicitly identifies Khamûl as the Ringwraith with a more ornate version of the Easterling helmets seen in ''The Lord of the Rings''.

'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)]]'':'''
:During the nighttime section of the Shire level, Frodo overhears the conversation between Khamûl and [[Gaffer Gamgee]] just as he is about to deliver the [[Bag End]] key to Number 3, Bagshot Row. The conversation plays out as it does in the novel except that Khamûl's lines are audible. Instead of simply walking back down the path after the conversation ends, Khamûl (who is mounted on his horse) intimidates the Gaffer by rearing his steed while letting out a ghastly wail, before galloping back down the road. No voice actor is specified for the role.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The Nazgûl in charge of Dol Guldur is known simply as "The Lieutenant of Dol Guldur", formerly "The Cursed Rider". He is said to have been an Easterling chieftain who wielded the Ring "Orôm, the Warmonger".

'''2024: ''[[War of the Ring: The Card Game]]'':'''
:Khamûl appears in "The Black Easterling" card and is illustrated by [[:Category:Images by Andrea Piparo|Andrea Piparo]].
