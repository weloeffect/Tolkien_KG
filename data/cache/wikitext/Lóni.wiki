'''Lóni''' was a [[Dwarves of Erebor|dwarf of Erebor]].

== History ==
Lóni was part of [[Balin's Colony]] to reclaim [[Moria]]. Their mission at first seemed successful, and [[Balin]] went so far as to claim the title [[Lord of Moria]]. This all changed in their fifth year there. On November 10, the [[Orcs]] came up the [[Silverlode]] and killed Balin while he was alone, unaware, and looking into [[Mirrormere]]. The Dwarves fought back but eventually lost [[East-gate]] and [[First Hall]]. 
The Orcs made it across the [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm]], there was a [[Battle of the Second Hall|battle in the Second Hall]], and Lóni and his companions [[Frár]] and [[Náli]] died bravely while the rest of the colonists retreated.<ref>{{FR|Bridge}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
''Lóni'' is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. His name most likely means "lazy person".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>
