'''Rush''' was a Canadian prog-rock band, which in its longest-standing lineup consisted of drummer and principal lyricist [[wikipedia:Neil Peart|Neil Peart]], bassist and singer [[wikipedia:Geddy Lee|Geddy Lee]], and guitarist [[wikipedia:Alex Lifeson|Alex Lifeson]]. The trio released two songs based on Tolkien's writings.

==Rivendell==
"Rivendell" is the sixth and last track on Rush's February [[1975]] album, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_by_Night_(album) ''Fly by Night'']. A ballad, it tells of the beauties and peace afforded the weary traveller while staying in [[Rivendell]].

The lyrics were penned by Peart, and the music was composed by Lee, who sang and (according to conjecture) played the acoustic guitar part as well.

===Lyrics excerpt===
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">Elfin songs and endless nights
Sweet wine and soft relaxing lights
Time will never touch you
Here in this enchanted place

You feel there's something calling you
You're wanting to return
To where the misty mountains rise and friendly fires burn
A place you can escape the world
Where the dark Lord cannot go
Peace of mind and sanctuary by loud water's flow<ref>[https://lyrics.lyricfind.com/lyrics/rush-rivendell Lyrics of "Rivendell"] on lyricfind.com (retrieved 26 April 2024)</ref>
</poem>

==The Necromancer==
"The Necromancer" is the fourth track on the band's third studio album, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caress_of_Steel ''Caress of Steel''], which was released in September of [[1975]]. The epic 12-minute track, with three distinct sections, features lyrics by Peart and music by Lee and Lifeson.

===Lyrics excerpt===
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">Brooding in the tower
Watching over his lands
Holding ev'ry creature
Helplessly they stand<ref>[https://lyrics.lyricfind.com/lyrics/rush-the-necromancer-into-darkness-under-the-shadow-return-of-the-prince Lyrics of "The Necromancer"] on lyricfind.com (retrieved 26 April 2024)</ref>
