'''Háma''' was the Doorward of [[Théoden]] and Captain of the King's Guard of [[Rohan]]. He was a loyal and devoted man, though he often anticipated his orders.

==History==
Háma served as the doorguard of [[Edoras]], the abode of the [[Kings of Rohan|King of Rohan]]. On [[2 March]] {{TA|3019}}, four guests arrived at his post: [[Aragorn]], [[Gimli]], [[Legolas]] and [[Gandalf]].<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> He stood by the rules of the house, and ordered them all to surrender their weapons. He entered into a long argument with Aragorn who refused to hand [[Andúril]] to anyone else until he agreed to do so at the wish of Gandalf. He permitted Gandalf to keep his staff, a deliberate decision which would prove decisive in the healing of his king.

For this oversight, Háma was reprimanded by [[Théoden]] and was briefly relieved of his position as the doorguard. Háma did his Lord's bidding, and also released [[Éomer]] from captivity. The King's sister-son had been imprisoned by [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]], who had been overthrown with the use of Gandalf's staff shortly before. Háma arrested Gríma, and found various missing items in his possession, including [[Herugrim]], the King's sword.<ref name="King"/>

Háma rode with Théoden to the [[Hornburg]], and fought in the [[Battle of the Hornburg|battle]] that ensued shortly after. He fell before the great gate, and his body was hacked to pieces by a horde of [[Uruk-hai|Uruks]].<ref name="Voice">{{TT|III10}}</ref> He was given the honour of being buried in a grave of his own under the shadow of the Hornburg. Despite his annoyance with his doorguard, Théoden obviously had an affection for Háma, and grieved at his fall, so much so that he personally cast first earth on his grave.<ref>{{TT|III8}}</ref>

On [[5 March]] when Théoden rejected the words of [[Saruman]], the hewing of Háma's body before the gate of the Hornburg was among the grievances he cited.<ref name="Voice"/>

==Etymology==
The name ''Háma'' comes from [[Old English]], and means as much as "home, house, dwelling". The same element is used in ''[[Hamfast (disambiguation)|Hamfast]]''.<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'' by [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]], page 501</ref>

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:[[Michael Spice]] voiced Háma. On the ride to Orthanc the dialogue of a nameless rider's suspicions of Gandalf's motives in the novel is transferred to Háma. In the book the rider is rebuked for these suspicions by Hama, but in this production the rebuke is made by Éomer.

'''1992: [[Der Herr der Ringe (1992 German radio series)|''Der Herr der Ringe'' (1992 German radio series)]]:'''
:Háma is played by Dieter Eppler.

'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''
:[[John Leigh]] plays Háma. The lengthy dialogue with Aragorn is absent in the movie, since Aragorn is not bearing [[Andúril]]. He is killed during a [[Wargs|Warg]]-attack on the road to [[Helm's Deep]], rather than in the battle itself.

:Later in the movie, Aragorn is seen talking with "[[Haleth (film character)|Haleth, son of Háma]]". The name could be a reference to the synonymous siblings [[Haleth son of Helm|Haleth]] and [[Háma son of Helm|Háma]], the sons of [[Helm|Helm Hammerhand]].

'''2002: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of Háma is provided by Dušan Lenczi.

'''2012: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:First met in [[Edoras]], Háma escorts the player and their companions to an audience with King [[Théoden]] on two separate occasions. He later travels to [[Helm's Deep]], where after the battle a song of his valiant last stand before the gates is sung by King's minstrel [[Gléowine]].
