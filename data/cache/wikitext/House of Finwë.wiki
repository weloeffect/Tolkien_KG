The '''House of Finwë''' was a large [[Noldor]]in royal house founded by [[Finwë]], [[King of the Noldor]]. Its device was that of a great golden sun, even though Finwë was slain before the [[Sun]] was made.

The House of Finwë had three main branches, one for each of Finwë's sons: the [[House of Fëanor]], the [[House of Fingolfin]] and the [[House of Finarfin]].
===Lineage===
Finwë had two wives. His first was [[Míriel]], who passed away soon after bearing their only child, [[Fëanor]]. His second wife was [[Indis]], of the [[Vanyar]], who bore him two sons: [[Fingolfin]] and [[Finarfin]], and two daughters: [[Findis]] and [[Írimë]].

==Other versions of the legendarium==
Finwë's two daughters don't appear in the published ''[[Silmarillion]]''.

In earlier versions of the legendarium, Finwë and Indis had three daughters: '''Findis''', '''Faniel''' and '''Finvain'''. It remains unclear if the third daughter survived in the final conception of Finwë's family tree.<ref>{{PM|Shibboleth}}, note 26</ref>
