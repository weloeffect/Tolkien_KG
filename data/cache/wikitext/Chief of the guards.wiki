The '''chief of the guards''', or just the '''chief guard''', was a [[Elves of Mirkwood|Wood-elf]] who served as the captain of the guards in [[Thranduil|Thranduil's]] [[Elvenking's Halls|halls]] in the [[Woodland Realm]] of northeastern [[Mirkwood]].<ref name=barrels>{{H|Barrels}}</ref>

==History==
The chief of the guards served King [[Thranduil]] (and presumably also Thranduil's son [[Legolas]]). One evening in {{TA|2941}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> the chief of the guards was coaxed by [[Galion]], the king's butler, to join him in tasting some new wine that had recently arrived to "''see if it is fit for the king's table''". The heady vintage from [[Dorwinion]] soon put the two Elves asleep, which gave [[Bilbo Baggins]] his chance to free [[Thorin]] and [[Thorin and Company|the other Dwarves]] (who had been imprisoned in Thranduil's dungeons during the [[Quest of Erebor]]). Using the chief of the guard's keys and his [[One Ring|Magic Ring]], Bilbo freed the [[Dwarves]] and secreted them into several empty barrels, though he did also return the keys the their proper place. When other Elves arrived to push the barrels in, they found the chief of the guards asleep alongside Galion and woke them both up.<ref name=barrels/>

'''1977: [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1977 film)]]:'''

'''1980: [[Der Hobbit (1980 German radio series)|''Der Hobbit'' (1980 German radio series)]]:'''

'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]:'''''
:The chief of the guards was given the name '''Elros''' and is portrayed by the New Zealand actor Robin Kerr. Unlike in the book, he was given a slightly expanded role as well as the title of '''Keeper of the Keys'''. He assists in the capture of [[Thorin and Company]] in [[Mirkwood]]. He is still briefly seen by [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] (while he's wearing the [[One Ring]]) in the cellars of the [[Elvenking's Halls]], where he is invited by Galion to drink with him, retaining his role in the book. They both end up passing out, allowing Bilbo and the [[Thorin and Company|Dwarves]] to escape through the cellars. Unlike the book, he is seen afterwards, after [[Thranduil]] had given the order to lock all gates to the kingdom, informing [[Legolas]] that [[Tauriel]] had left the halls armed with her bow and blade.
