'''Bofur''' most likely lived in the [[Blue Mountains]] with [[Thorin]] after the loss of [[Thráin|Thráin II]].<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref>  Bofur was one of the thirteen [[Dwarves]] of [[Thorin and Company|Thorin's company]] who journeyed to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] to challenge the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Smaug]].  After the death of Smaug, Bofur lived at the Lonely Mountain in great wealth.<ref name="Meetings">{{FR|II1}}</ref>

==History==
=== Family and birth ===
Bofur's parentage is unknown; the only familial connections mentioned are that [[Bombur]] is his brother and [[Bifur]] is his cousin.<ref name="Flies">{{H|Flies}}</ref> He was not of Durin's line although he was descended from the Dwarves of [[Moria]].<ref name="Durin"/> His birth year is also unknown. 

However, in [[Bilbo Baggins]]' account of the quest to Erebor he stated that the brothers [[Fíli]] and [[Kíli]] were the youngest of the thirteen "by some fifty years",<ref name="Hill">{{H|Hill}}</ref> and that when Thorin was missing [[Balin]] was "the eldest left".<ref>{{H|Barrels}}</ref> Since Kíli was born in {{TA|2864}} and Balin was born in {{TA|2763|n}},<ref name="Durin"/> this would put Bofur's birth between {{TA|2763|n}} and c. 2814, and he would have been between c. 127 and 178 years old during the quest to Erebor.

===The Quest of Erebor===
In {{TA|2941}}, Bofur was one of the four Dwarves in the fifth group to arrive at [[Bag End]], wearing a yellow hood along with his cousin Bifur.  He asked for mince pies and cheese as also stating what Bifur and Bombur wanted also.  During the evening when Thorin called for music, Bofur (along with [[Bifur]]) played a clarinet.<ref name="Party">{{H|Party}}</ref>

After escaping the Goblins, the company was chased by wolves into a glade, Bofur shared a pine tree with Bifur, [[Bombur]], and Thorin, and later was rescued by the [[Eagles]].<ref>{{H|Pan}}</ref> When [[Gandalf]] was telling the story of the company's adventures to [[Beorn]], Bofur, Bifur, and Bombur were the last of the Dwarves to show up. The following morning, Bilbo realizes Bofur had fallen over him and then told him about breakfast left for Bilbo from the skin-changer<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>

Later on in [[Mirkwood]] when Bombur needed support to escape the spiders, Bifur and Bofur helped him. Then after the barrel ride down the [[River Running]] both Bofur and Bifur came out fairly dry and not very knocked about, but they lay down and refused to do anything.<ref>{{H|Welcome}}</ref> Later Bofur and Bombur would stay down to take care of the ponies, nearly killed by Smaug, though saved.

Bofur fought in and survived the [[Battle of Five Armies]].  He was given his share of the treasure by [[Dáin Ironfoot]], Thorin's cousin and now king under the mountain after Thorin's death, and made his home in Erebor along with Bifur and Bombur and the other survivors of the Battle.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

===Later life===
At [[Rivendell]] in {{TA|3018}}, [[Glóin]] told [[Frodo Baggins]] that Bofur was still alive and living in Erebor, along with Bifur and Bombur.<ref name="Meetings"/> It is possible that Bofur fought in the [[Battle of Dale]] against [[Sauron]]'s forces the [[Easterlings]]. His death date is unknown though it would have been before [[Dwalin]] as he was the last dwarf of the company to pass away in {{foA|91}}.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Appendix A]], "Durin's Folk"</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Bǫvurr'' appears in the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. Its meaning is unknown.<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In one of the earliest manuscript fragments of ''The Hobbit'', Bofur and Bifur went into the hall and came back with their walking sticks, which they ''turned into'' clarinets.<ref>{{HH|Bladorthin}}, p. 36</ref>  In the published text the two Dwarves came back from the hall with clarinets that they ''had left'' with their walking sticks.<ref name="Party"/>  [[John Rateliff]] (author of ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]'') said that in the earliest phase Tolkien had added fairy tale touches of Dwarven magic to emphasize the uncanny, other-worldly nature of the Dwarves as opposed to Bilbo.<ref>{{HH|Bladorthin}}, (iii) ''Dwarven Magic'', p. 54</ref>

Originally, when Bombur needed propping up in [[Mirkwood]] after being cut from the spiders' webbing, it was ''his cousins'' Bofur and Bifur who provided support.<ref>{{HH|Mirkwood}}, p. 313</ref>  In the published story this was changed to Bombur's cousin Bifur and brother Bofur.<ref name="Flies"/>  Also, in the earlier version, when [[Smaug]] first came out and the Dwarves in the valley had to be hauled up to the [[Back Door]], Bifur cried out to save Bombur and Bofur, who were both his ''brothers''.<ref>{{HH|Conversations}}</ref>  In the published text Bifur cried out for his two ''cousins''.<ref>{{H|Inside}}</ref>

In Tolkien's unfinished [[1960]] rewrite of ''The Hobbit'', Bifur, Bofur and Bombur were Thorin's attendants.<ref>{{HH|5}}, "[[A Well-Planned Party]]", p. 774</ref> [[John D. Rateliff]] assumes this made them either courtiers or honor-guard.<ref>{{HH|5}}, "[[Arrival in Rivendell]]", note 32</ref>

==Notes==
In the earliest partial manuscript of ''The Hobbit'' more of the dialog later assigned to a few of the Dwarves is more evenly distributed.  In the opinion of John Rateliff this streamlining strengthened the story through simplification, but at the cost of relegating some of the Dwarves to obscurity since they barely speak at all.  Bofur is one of these "silenced" members of the company.<ref>{{HH|Pryftan}}, (i) ''The Lost Opening'', p. 14</ref>

:{{Blockquote|Endearing and likeable, Bofur has a disastrous tendency to state the obvious and blurt out things without thinking. With a love of music and a fine singing voice, Bofur delights in good food and good company and is unfailingly optimistic. Though not especially brave, he will do his best to help those in need, especially those he counts as friends.
