'''Nár''' was an old [[Dwarves|Dwarf]], the sole companion of King [[Thrór]] when he set out to wander in the wilds of [[Middle-earth]].

==History==
Almost nothing is known of Nár, other than that he accompanied Thrór, the [[King of Durin's folk]] on his final journey in his attempt to find fortune in wider world and escape the scorn of Men. They travelled together from [[Dunland]], where Thrór's relatives and subjects were living at the time, heading north they crossed the [[Redhorn Pass]] and came down into [[Azanulbizar]].<ref name=Durin>{{App|Durin}}</ref>

Their journey eventually brought them to the  ancient halls of [[Moria]], now infested with [[Orcs]] and [[Trolls]]. Nár begged Thrór to beware, but he took no heed and insisted on entering while Nár stayed behind and waited for the king not far from the gate.

That was the last any Dwarf ever saw of Thrór alive for he was beheaded by the Orcs, and their chieftain [[Azog]] branded his own name on Thrór's brow in [[Cirth|dwarf-runes]]. The Orcs allowed Nár to live only so that he could return to Thrór's son [[Thráin|Thráin II]] with a message that Azog now ruled in Moria and if any Dwarves dare enter there again, they will share the same fate. Azog threw towards him a pouch of few [[money|coins]] for his services as a messenger.

Nár fled back down the [[Silverlode]] to Dunland where his message caused such anger amongst his people that it raised a call to arms among all seven Dwarf Houses to avenge the elder high-king of their race, leading the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]]. 
In the climactic [[Battle of Azanulbizar]], Azog himself was slain along with thousands of others on both sides.<ref name=Durin/>

==Etymology==
''Nár'' is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. His name means "Corpse".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

'''2010: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Nár, now an elderly dwarf with bad eyesight and even worse memory, is living in Zudrugund, a settlement of [[Longbeard]] exiles from [[Erebor]] in [[Dunland]] that was abandoned when [[Thorin Oakenshield]] led his people to [[Ered Luin]]. Nár stayed behind and his elder years is now being looked after by Frithgeir, the only other dwarf in these lands.
:When the player is imprisoned in [[Orthanc]], Saruman taunts them that he had observed their movements for a long time and claims to have killed Nár after his usefulness came to an end. After escaping the captivity, the player checks back on Nár and Frithgeir and discovers that Saruman had lied. After the [[Siege of Erebor]], the new King [[Thorin III Stonehelm]] learns from the player that Nár is still alive and invites the old friend to live the rest of his days in peace under the halls of the [[Lonely Mountain]].
