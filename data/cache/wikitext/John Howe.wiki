John Howe was born in Vancouver, Canada.<ref name="bio">[https://www.john-howe.com/blog/biography/ Biography] at john-howe.com (accessed 8 June 2023)</ref> He graduated from the École des Arts Dècoratifs of [[wikipedia:Strasbourg|Strasbourg]]<ref name="bio" /> in [[1981]], having obtained a Diploma in Illustration.<ref>''[[The Tolkien Diary 1995]]''</ref> He now lives in [[wikipedia:Neuchatel|Neuchatel]] with his wife Fataneh and his son Dana.<ref name="bio" />

Howe first read [[The Lord of the Rings|''The Lord of the Rings'']] in high school, having borrowed the books from his school library. He started with [[The Two Towers|''The Two Towers'']] because "''everyone who started the first volume never got any further''" and [[The Fellowship of the Ring|''The Fellowship of the Ring'']] was rarely available to borrow.<ref name="myth">''Foreword'', [[Myth and Magic: The art of John Howe]]</ref> He was inspired by the artwork of [[The Brothers Hildebrandt]] to start creating illustrations of Tolkien's works.<ref name="myth" />

Howe's [[:File:John Howe - Boromir 01.jpg|version]] of [[Boromir]] is based on his own face.<ref>[https://www.john-howe.com/portfolio/gallery/details.php?image_id=1700 Image of Boromir] on john-howe.com (accessed 8 June 2023)</ref>

Howe and Lee returned to work as conceptual designers for [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'']] film series.

===Artwork theft===
In the night of 18 May 1997, eleven of Howe's originals were stolen from the Médiathèque of Sedan in [[:Category:Belgium|Belgium]]. The thief's father contacted the Médiathèque a couple weeks later promising to try to retrieve the stolen works from his son. Eight originals were finally returned, one ([[:File:John Howe - Minas Tirith.jpg|Minas Tirith]]) was damaged beyond repair. [[:File:John Howe - Eowyn and the Nazgul.jpg|''Éowyn and the Nazgûl'']], [[:File:John Howe - Gandalf the Grey 02.jpg|''Gandalf the Grey'']], and [[:File:John Howe - The Uruk-hai.jpg|''The Uruk-hai'']] were never recovered.<ref>[https://www.john-howe.com/forum/smf/index.php?topic=1905.0 The Great Art Robbery] at john-howe.com (accessed 8 June 2023)</ref>

==Quotations==
{{quote|Illustrating Tolkien means treading warily, dipping one's brush in shadow and rinsing them in light. Battle and balance, down the impossible path between the clear and the obscure.|John Howe on painting Middle-earth, ''[[Tolkien's World: Paintings of Middle-earth|Tolkien's World]]''.}}
{{quote|Somewhat shamefully I am obliged to admit that I first read ''[[The Two Towers]]'' and ''[[The Return of the King]]'', and finally ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]''. [...] Thus, I plunged directly into the world of Tolkien just above the [[Rauros|Falls of Rauros]] and have been swimming diligently ever since.|John Howe on his reading experience, ''[[Tolkien's World: Paintings of Middle-earth|Tolkien's World]]''.}}
{{quote|It was this place in North Island, and we wandered round these fields saying, well, [[Bag End]] can go here, that can be our party tree; it was very exciting. It's almost even more fun to have a location imposed upon you, because you really have to get down to brass tacks and figure it out, imagine it on paper. It's a real illustrator's job.|John Howe on working for [[Weta Workshop|Weta]], [http://movies.ign.com/articles/034/034289p1.html Interview].}}
{{Quote|Visualising Tolkien, I truly believe, is a process not unlike his own transcribing of his world, with the obvious advantage of having his texts to work from. It means illustrating between the lines, casting one's net farther out, searching for the credibility that is inherent in his work, with the disadvantage of not being to always leave elements to the imagination. This said, any illustration should be an invitation, with space for the viewer to bring his or her personal experience, both in relation to the reading experience and in a wider context, to complete the picture.|John Howe<ref>{{webcite|author=Urulókë|articleurl=https://www.tolkienguide.com/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?post_id=27164|articlename=Illustrating Tolkien's Unfinished Tales - a chat with the artists|dated=30 Sep, 2020|website=TolkienGuide|accessed=1 December, 2025|archiveurl=|archivename=|archivedate=}}</ref>}}
{{Quote|I see [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]’s artwork as a window into his mind, and a very useful one. They also reinforce the notion that creation is not so neatly divided into writing and painting or drawing, the two skills can contribute by turn to the same universe. I tend to agree with him: his universe is better not illustrated, but painting is my profession, so I will accept the contradiction. This said, while I understand his reluctance, and often talk with readers who would prefer that their imaginations not be “guided” by artwork, I do not think that the text has anything to fear from any picture. If the image does not find a symbiotic relationship with the word, then it is quickly forgotten. If the image persists, then it somehow captures what the text not only says, but more importantly, what it does not say.|John Howe<ref>{{webcite|author=Erie Rizzi Neves|articleurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20201020083519/https://tolkieniana.net/wp/intervista-a-john-howe/2/|articlename=An Interview with John Howe|dated=14 October, 2020|website=Tolkieniana|accessed=1 December, 2025}}</ref>}}
