'''Celebrían''' was an [[Elves|Elf]]-lady, the daughter of [[Celeborn]]<ref name=TA109>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 109, p. 1085</ref> and [[Galadriel]]<ref>{{FR|Farewell}}, p. 227</ref> and the wife of [[Elrond]]<ref name=TA109/>. She was the mother of [[Arwen]] and the twins [[Elrohir]] and [[Elladan]].<ref name="Children">{{App|TA}}, entries for the years 130 and 241, p. 1085</ref> Her daughter would later marry [[Aragorn|Aragorn Elessar]], hero of the [[War of the Ring]],<ref>{{App|Chief}}, entry for the year 3019, ''Mid-year's Day''</ref> and become the Queen of the [[Reunited Kingdom]]<ref>{{RK|Partings}}, p. 974</ref>.

==History==
Celebrían was born early in the Second Age, likely in {{SA|300}}, when Galadriel refused to return to [[Eressëa]], and passed over the [[Blue Mountains|Mountains]].<ref name="Scales">{{NM|P1ix}}, p. 65</ref> Celebrían lived in [[Eregion]], and later moved to [[Lothlórien|Lórien]] with her mother in {{SA|1350}}. In {{SA|1701}}, she went to [[Rivendell]] with Galadriel searching for Celeborn, where she first met Lord Elrond, who loved her in secret.<ref name="Concerning">{{UT|Concerning}}, pp. 234, 240</ref> Their marriage was delayed by the wars against [[Sauron]],<ref>{{NM|Ages}}</ref>{{rp|135}} though they would eventually wed in {{TA|109}}.<ref name=TA109/> Their first children, the twins [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]], were born in {{TA|130|n}}, and their daughter [[Arwen]] in {{TA|241|n}}.<ref name="Children"/> She had inherited the [[Elfstone]] from her mother, which was later given to Arwen, her daughter.<ref>{{UT|Elessar}}, p. 251</ref>

In {{TA|2509}}, on a trip to [[Lothlórien|Lórien]] to visit her parents, she was waylaid by [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] in the [[Redhorn Pass]]. She was captured and tormented, receiving a poisoned wound. Her sons rescued her and she was physically healed by Elrond, but never fully recovered in mind or spirit, and no longer wished to stay in Middle-earth. She left for the [[Grey Havens]] and passed over the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] the following year.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, entry about Chieftain Arahad I, p. 1043</ref>

She was followed by Elrond and her mother Galadriel, who eventually took the [[White Ship]] in the end of the [[Third Age]] and also passed the [[Great Sea]] to the [[Undying Lands]],<ref>{{RK|Havens}}, p. 1029</ref> where they presumably reunited with her. Later Celeborn and possibly her sons, Elladan and Elrohir, also went to the Grey Havens to sail to the Undying Lands,<ref>{{FR|Records}}, p. 15</ref> and presumably reunited with Celebrían.

==Etymology==
{{pronounce|Sindarin - Celebrían.mp3|Gilgamesh}}
''Celebrían'' is a [[Sindarin]] name<ref name=Eldamo>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-2160008161.html|articlename=S. ''Celebrían'' f.|website=Eldamo|accessed=12 September 2024}}</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 338</ref>, which means "Silver queen"<ref>{{L|345}}, p. 423</ref>. It is probably a compound of  ''[[celeb]]'' ("silver") and ''rían'' ("queen").<ref name=Eldamo/>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
J.R.R. Tolkien tried to define the birth-year of Celebrían in different manuscripts, specially those dealing with chronology and Elven growth. Here are the dates of the [[Second Age]], presented in chronological order as Tolkien considered them: {{SA|300|n}} (circa),<ref>{{NM|P3xvi}}, p. 346</ref> 300 ("probably"),<ref name="Scales" /> 260 or {{SA|350|n}},<ref>{{NM|P1x}}, p. 73</ref> {{SA|850|n}} (a proposal while calculating her age),<ref>{{NM|P1xi}}, pp. 77, 79</ref> 9 (circa) or 45.<ref>{{NM|P1xviii}}, p. 149</ref>

In "[[Concerning Galadriel and Celeborn]]" (the only narrative dealing with a complete history of Middle-earth during the [[Second Age]]), both Celebrían and [[Amroth]] are children of Galadriel and Celeborn,<ref name="Concerning" /> but in later texts J.R.R. Tolkien gave Amroth a [[Sindar]]in origin.<ref>{{UT|Amroth}}, p. 244</ref>

In the drafts of ''[[The Tale of Years]]'' of the Third Age, Elrond married Celebrían c. [[Third Age|T.A.]] 2500 and their children were born in the same century. In {{TA|2600}}, she was slain by Orcs instead of captured.<ref name="Tale">{{PM|VIII}}</ref>{{rp|226}} The marriage was later changed to 2300, and her capture and departure to 2509.<ref name="Tale" />{{rp|234–6}}
