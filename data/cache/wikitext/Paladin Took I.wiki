==History==
There are no direct records of Paladin I but he was evidently the namesake of [[Paladin Took II|Paladin II]].<ref name="App|Took">{{App|Took}}</ref> Paladin I's reign as Thain came between the beginning of the Took line of Thains in {{SR|740}} and the reign of [[Isengrim Took II|Isengrim II]], which began in {{SR|1083}}, after which there were no gaps in the Took family's genealogy.<ref name="App|B2">{{App|B2}}</ref>

==Etymology==
A "[[wikipedia:Paladin|paladin]]" is a high office which existed in medieval Europe - which entered into many tales - and was a noble office held by an honourable and valiant knight. In particular, a paladin was one of the twelve peers of Charlemagne's court. The term comes from the Latin ''palatinus'' which means "of the palace".<ref>[[Jim Allan]] (ed.), ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', "Giving of Names"</ref>
