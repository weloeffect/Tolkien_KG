}}'''Lothíriel''' was the daughter of [[Imrahil|Prince Imrahil]] of [[Dol Amroth]], and later the wife of King [[Éomer]] of [[Rohan]]. 

==History==
Lothíriel was born in {{TA|2999}}. She had three older brothers: [[Elphir]], [[Erchirion]], and [[Amrothos]].<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, ''The Line of Dol Amroth'', p. 221</ref>

Lothíriel married [[Éomer]], King of [[Rohan]], in {{TA|3021}}. They had at least one son, [[Elfwine|Elfwine the Fair]], who became the 19th King of Rohan upon the death of his father in {{FoA|63}}.<ref>{{App|Mark}}, ''Third Line'', entry ''Éomer Éadig'', p. 1070</ref> Whether Lothíriel still lived by that date, or died after, is unknown.

==Etymology==
Lothíriel is probably a [[Sindarin]] name. Its meaning is not glossed, but David Salo suggests that it means "lady of flowers" and contains the elements ''[[loth]]'' ("flower", blossom"), ''[[hîr]]'' ("lord", "master") and the suffix ''[[-iel]]'' ("daugher", feminine suffix).<ref>{{HM|GS}}, entry '''Lothíriel''', p. 354</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the published version of ''[[The Return of the King]]'', Lothíriel and Éomer were wedded in "the last year of the [[Third Age]]". In [[Appendix B]], "The Tale of Years" states that 3021 was the last of the Third Age,<ref>{{App|Chief}}, p. 1096</ref> and thus the wedding took place in that year.  However, in a late manuscript of what would later become Appendix B the wedding of Lothíriel and Éomer was set in "3022 (or [[Fourth Age]] 1)".<ref name=Third/>

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''

:Lothíriel first appeared in "The Road to Gondor", the first book of Volume 4 of ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'', and can be found in the Great Hall of the Prince in Dol Amroth. 

:Denethor II proposed to Imrahil a betrothal between Boromir and Lothíriel. Because the betrothal was between close kin, it was disapproved by both Imrahil and Boromir - as well as a part of the population - but neither dared to refuse his request. Both Lothíriel and Boromir reluctantly consented as obedient children, though both were unhappy with the betrothal.<ref name="SOS 1.10">[[The Lord of the Rings Online]], Volume IV: "The Strength of Sauron", Book I: [[The Road to Gondor]], ''Chapter 10: Keepers of History''</ref> The marriage was to be in the summer of {{TA|3018}}, but was postponed after Boromir suddenly had to travel to [[Rivendell]].<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings Online]], Volume IV: "The Strength of Sauron", Book I: [[The Road to Gondor]], ''Chapter 12: The Shadow in Morthond''</ref> After the betrothal she often left Dol Amroth and had dealings with the Elves.<ref name="SOS 1.10"/> She met Dorthaneth, leader of the Avorrim, who became one of her closest friends. Dorthaneth counseled her concerning her betrothal to Boromir and - during the [[War of the Ring]] - weapons, armies and war.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings Online]], Volume IV: "The Strength of Sauron", Book I: [[The Road to Gondor]], ''Chapter 9: A Message for Lothíriel''</ref> She mourned the death of Boromir, though she was relieved that she would not have to marry him.<ref name="SOS 1.10"/>

:When her father answered the summon of Denethor II and marched to Minas Tirith with a large part of the army, Lothíriel was left in charge of Dol Amroth. She sent detachments of [[Swan-knights]] to [[Lamedon]] and the [[Blackroot Vale]] against her father's wishes.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings Online]], Volume IV: "The Strength of Sauron", Book I: [[The Road to Gondor]], ''Chapter 5: A Difficult Road''</ref>  She had two purposes in mind, firstly, to protect the local peoples against evil, and secondly, to rebel against her father. When she learned of the threat of the [[Corsairs of Umbar]] to Dol Amroth, she recalled the Swan-knights back to protect Dol Amroth.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings Online]], Volume IV: "The Strength of Sauron", Book I: [[The Road to Gondor]], ''Chapter 11: The Swan-knights''</ref>
