The '''Captain of the Haven''' was the title of a person in [[Umbar]] during the rule of [[Ruling Steward|Steward]] [[Ecthelion II]] of [[Gondor]].

Sometime between {{TA|2957}} and {{TA|2980|n}}, [[Aragorn]] came to Gondor in disguise under the name ''[[Thorongil]]'' and served Steward Ecthelion II.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2957-80, p. 1090</ref> During that time he often counselled him that the rebels in [[Umbar]] were a danger to the southern fiefs of Gondor. In {{TA|2980}} Ecthelion II permitted Thorongil to attack Umbar with a small fleet. Thorongil arrived with his fleet unnoticed at night and burnt a large part of the ships of the unprepared Corsairs. Thorongil himself overthrew the Captain of the Haven in a battle on the quays before he retreated with his fleet with small losses.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}, entry for Steward Ecthelion II, "Denethor, the son of Ecthelion [...] after four years he succeeded on the death of his father", p. 1055</ref>
