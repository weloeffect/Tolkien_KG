==Lyrics==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Chip the glasses, crack the plates!
That's what [[Bilbo Baggins]] hates!
That's what Bilbo Baggins hates,
So carefully, carefully with the plates!

Blunt the knives and bend the forks!
Smash the bottles, burn the corks!
That's what Bilbo Baggins hates,
So carefully, carefully with the plates!
</poem>
