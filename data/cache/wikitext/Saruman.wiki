{{quote|[Saruman] is great among the Wise. He is the chief of my order and the head of the Council. His knowledge is deep, but his pride has grown with it, and he takes ill any meddling. The lore of the Elven-rings, great and small, is his province. He has long studied it, seeking the lost secrets of their making...|[[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', "[[The Shadow of the Past]]"}}

'''Saruman the White''' was the first of the order of [[Wizards]] (or ''[[Istari]]'') who came to [[Middle-earth]] as Emissaries of the [[Valar]] in the [[Third Age]]. For a time he was the chief of the Wizards, as well as the head of the [[White Council]]. However, through his appreciation of [[Sauron]]'s innate strength, his envy of [[Gandalf]] and his overbearing hubris, the White Wizard fell into mimicry of the [[Dark Lord]] as his capable yet faithless servant, plotting to share in his power or to two-facedly seize the [[One Ring]] first. 

Both at Sauron's whim and for his own ambitions, Saruman coordinated assaults from his [[Orthanc]] tower in [[Isengard]] against the realm of [[Rohan]] during the [[War of the Ring]], while sapping the kingdom through his agent Gríma. However, the corrupted Wizard's legions were vanquished and he was forced to remain a prisoner in his own tower, though not for long. Allowed to leave Orthanc, he travelled to the [[Shire]], which his outlaw pawns had gained control over, and became the hidden local thug lord. Saruman was again defeated by the rallied, oppressed Hobbits and he himself was backstabbed by Gríma for his mistreatment. His unbodied spirit was denied the [[West]] and fled naked and impotent, a fate not unlike that of Sauron.

==History==
===Early history===
As a [[Maia]], Saruman was created by [[Ilúvatar]] before the [[Music of the Ainur]].<ref name="Ainu">{{S|Ainu}}</ref> In his early days in [[Valinor]], he went by the name ''[[Curumo]]''<ref name="Istari6">{{UT|13a}}, note 6, p. 401</ref> or ''Tarindor''.<ref name="Cuv" /> Like Sauron, he was a powerful Maia of [[Aulë]].<ref>{{S|Vala}}</ref>

After the Valar discovered the primeval [[Elves]] at [[Cuiviénen]], Tarindor was one of the [[Five Guardians]] sent to protect the Elves from the forces of [[Melkor]].<ref name="Cuv">{{NM|P1xiii}}, p. 95</ref> It is unclear how long he remained or if he accompanied the [[Eldar]] on the [[Great Journey]].

===Return to Middle-earth===
After the defeat of Morgoth, the Valar grew concerned about the rising power of Sauron in Middle-earth. In Valinor, a council was called by [[Manwë]], where it was decided to send Maiar as emissaries to Middle-earth to help the [[Free Peoples]] challenge Sauron. The council likely met in the middle of the Second Age, shortly after the creation of the [[Rings of Power]]. The council determined that these emissaries (who became known as the Istari or Wizards) should be "mighty, peers of Sauron, yet [they should] forgo might, and clothe themselves in flesh so as to treat on equality and win the trust of Elves and Men."<ref name="Istari">{{UT|Istari}}</ref>{{rp|393}} Curumo, who was sent to the council by Aulë, volunteered to travel to Middle-earth as an emissary; he was appointed the first Istar and became the chief of their Order.<ref name="Istari" />{{rp|389, 394}}

Even before arriving in Middle-earth, Curumo begrudged his peers among the Istari. ''[[Gandalf|Olórin]]'' (later called Gandalf), who did not wish to travel to Middle-earth, was commanded by Manwë to go as the third Istar. Saruman's jealousy of Gandalf began here, when [[Varda]] said of Gandalf that he was "not the third". Saruman was charged to take [[Aiwendil]] (later called Radagast) with him to please [[Yavanna]], which he did not wish to do, and this led to his contempt for the latter Wizard.<ref name="Istari" />{{rp|393}}

In Middle-earth, Curomo became known in [[Sindarin]] as ''[[Curunír]]'' and in [[Westron]] by his most common name, ''Saruman''. Like the other Wizards, his [[fana]] took the appearance of an old man. He had raven hair and was robed in white.<ref name="Istari" />{{rp|393}}

Saruman and others of the Istari arrived in Middle-earth on a ship at [[Mithlond]] (the [[Grey Havens]]) in [[Lindon]] around the year 1000 of the Third Age.<ref name="Istari" /> At the time of their arrival, their origin, nature, purpose, and true names were a secret to nearly everyone in Middle-earth. Having witnessed their arrival, [[Círdan]] alone knew the truth of their identity and origin. He chose to give [[Narya]], the Red Ring, to Gandalf to aid him in his mission.<ref name="AppTA">{{App|TA}}</ref> Círdan told only [[Galadriel]] and [[Elrond]] of the true origins of the Istari.<ref name="SV" /> After a time, Saruman learned of Círdan's gift and begrudged it; this heightened the hidden ill-will that he bore towards Gandalf.<ref name="Istari" />

Shortly after arriving, Saruman travelled into the [[East]] of Middle-earth, as did the two [[Blue Wizards]]. After one and a half millennia he returned to the West, just as Sauron's power was growing again in [[Dol Guldur]].

===Chief of the White Council===
[[File:Angus McBride - Saruman.gif|thumb|''Saruman'' by [[Angus McBride]]]]
When the White Council was formed around {{TA|2463}},<ref name="AppTA" /> Saruman was appointed its leader despite Galadriel's wishes that Gandalf be leader. Even then, he had begun to sense the resurgence of Sauron and to envy and desire his power, and especially his One Ring. Coincidentally, in that same year, the One Ring was found by the creature [[Gollum]],<ref name="AppTA" /> drawing the Dark Lord closer to the conflict that would eventually prove Saruman's undoing.

During this period, Saruman spent years in [[Minas Tirith]] examining its archives. It is possible that there he surmised that a [[Palantíri|''palantír'']] would still be located in Orthanc, the tower of Isengard.<ref>{{UT|Palantiri}}</ref> He offered to make Isengard his home and to command the defences of the West. This was welcomed by King [[Fréaláf]] of Rohan and [[Ruling Steward|Steward]] [[Beren (Steward of Gondor)|Beren]] of [[Gondor]] alike. In {{TA|2759}}, Saruman was given the [[Key of Orthanc]] in the ring of Isengard his abode, hoping that he would prove an important ally.<ref name="SV">{{S|V}}</ref><ref name="stew">{{App|Stewards}}</ref> There he became important in the defence of the free lands of the West. In Orthanc he came upon the [[Orthanc-stone]], one of the seven seeing stones, but kept it secret and hidden, particularly from the White Council.<ref name="AppEorl" /> He would later betray the Council by concealing his use of it. 

In {{TA|2851}}, the White Council met and Gandalf revealed that the evil presence in Dol Guldur was indeed Sauron and that he had returned, and urged an attack there. Saruman however believed that Sauron would be useful in his quest: allowing Sauron to build up his strength, the One Ring would reveal itself, and Saruman hoped to have sufficient strength to seize it first himself until that event. With this strategy in mind, Saruman overruled Gandalf. It soon became clear that Saruman desired to possess the One Ring himself.<ref name="c250">{{FR|Council}} p. 250-51</ref>

He soon found that Sauron had more knowledge of the possible location of the One Ring than he expected, and in {{TA|2941}} he finally consented to an [[Attack on Dol Guldur]] against Sauron at which point Sauron retreated to [[Mordor]].<ref name="AppTA" /><ref name="c250" />
[[File:Angus McBride - Dol Guldur.jpg|thumb|left|''Dol Guldur'' by [[Angus McBride]]]]
In {{TA|2953}}, the [[Wise]] gathered once more to debate about the Rings of Power. Saruman quieted the Council claiming to have the knowledge that the One Ring was lost forever in the [[Belegaer]]. Following their final meeting (and the death of [[Turgon (Steward of Gondor)|Steward Turgon]]), Saruman took Isengard for his own and fortified it.<ref name="stew" /> Saruman, jealous and afraid of Gandalf, set spies to watch all his movements; thus he discovered the existence of the Shire and noted Gandalf's interest in it, and started sending agents in [[Bree]] and the [[Southfarthing]].<ref name="AppTA" /> As [[Lord of Isengard]], Saruman began to bring trouble to Rohan by aiding its enemies.<ref name="AppEorl">{{App|Eorl}}</ref> But the Wise were already suspicious about him; [[Aragorn]] tried to advise Steward [[Ecthelion II]] not to trust Saruman for his help against Sauron.<ref name="stew" />

Sauron had declared himself openly in Mordor; he established contact with Saruman through the [[Ithil-stone]] his minions had captured from [[Minas Ithil]]. Through his jealousy towards Gandalf and his ever-growing pride and arrogance, and through the use of the ''palantír'', Saruman was ensnared by Sauron. Using either the knowledge of his new ally or lore of lost [[Eregion]], Saruman crafted his own lesser ring and sought to emulate Sauron. His corruption was complete around {{TA|3000}}.<ref name="AppTA" /> The Wizard intended to share in the Dark Lord's power one way or another; he would aid in Sauron's victory to win his approval and become his equal lieutenant, or cheat him and try to supplant him by acquiring the One Ring for himself. 

===War of the Ring===
At about this time, in an attempt to control Rohan, Saruman bought the allegiance of King [[Théoden]]'s chief advisor, [[Gríma]], who then counselled the ailing king to do nothing about the steady resurgence of Sauron's armies. Saruman and Gríma's treachery would have crippled Rohan's military might and allowed Sauron lordship of the kingdom, had not Gandalf interfered a year later and revealed to Théoden his right-hand man's true designs, healing the old king and revitalising his political and military rule.<ref>{{TT|King}}</ref>

He had sent spies to negotiate the purchase of [[pipe-weed]] from the Shire, in preparation for the war, and also learn of any [[Hobbits]] who had departed recently in hopes of finding out who possessed the One Ring.<ref name="UT10">{{UT|10}}, "Concerning Gandalf, Saruman, and the Shire"</ref> 

Saruman did not reveal his true intentions until Gandalf presented him with the discovery and location of the One Ring. On [[10 July]], {{TA|3018}}, Gandalf arrived at Isengard.<ref name="AppGreat">{{App|Great}}</ref> Saruman demanded that Gandalf submit to him or to Sauron. Saruman then stood forth as [[Many Colours|Saruman of Many Colours]], and when Gandalf refused to join his new Lord or tell him of the Ring, he held him captive in Isengard. 

[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers - Gríma and Saruman.jpg|thumb|left|Saruman commanding his forces from Orthanc as seen in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' film]]

It must have been during Gandalf's captivity in Orthanc that Saruman began to assemble his following of [[Orcs]], [[Dunlendings]] and [[Uruk-hai]] into a massive army, since Gandalf came to an as yet undestroyed Isengard. From the pinnacle of the tower Gandalf could see that Saruman was gathering his hordes of Orcs and [[Wolves]] in his pits and forges, both in service and in competition with Sauron.<ref name="FRCouncil">{{FR|Council}}</ref> One can speculate that if matters had developed a little more slowly, his puppet Gríma would have gained full control over Rohan, and the [[Rohirrim]] would have been enslaved or destroyed.

Gandalf later escaped, and so Saruman's treachery and professed allegiance to Sauron became known to the rest of the White Council when Gandalf reported this during the subsequent [[Council of Elrond]].<ref name="FRCouncil" />

Saruman soon also betrayed his master, Sauron, by lying to the [[Witch-king]] when he arrived at Isengard. Sauron had sent the [[Nazgûl]] searching for [[Bilbo Baggins|Baggins]], who had found the One Ring years before, and the Shire, his home. Saruman pretended to know nothing about the Shire. But the Lord of Minas Morgul and his company did not have the strength to assault the Ring of Isengard. Saruman told them that he believed Gandalf knew the whereabouts of the Ring, and the Nazgûl departed.<ref name="UTHunt" />

In September of {{TA|3018}}, the Nazgûl captured one of his Shire [[Squint-eyed southerner|spies]] who told the [[Witch-king]] everything, betraying Saruman, and exposing the Wizard's double treachery. They also seized some maps and information about the Shire and [[Baggins]].<ref name="UT10" /> Perceived as a turncoat by the Free Peoples and fearing being caught as an unfaithful vassal of Mordor, Saruman put all efforts into reassuring Sauron of his commitment or obtaining the One Ring for himself.<ref name="UTHunt">{{UT|Hunt}}</ref>

The failure to capture the Ring at [[Emyn Muil]] further ruined Saruman's plans, as he was revealed as a certain traitor to Sauron as well.

[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Wrath of the Ents.jpg|thumb|''The Wrath of the Ents'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]

Finding himself in a precarious position, Saruman could only hope to acquire the Ring or convince Sauron of his loyalty. Therefore he implemented an aggressive strategy of attacking Rohan, endeavouring to kill the King's son [[Théodred]], sending spies to waylay [[Frodo Baggins]] on his flight from the Shire, and dispatching raiding parties on likely routes a company of the Ring might take to Gondor. Ironically, one of these parties captured [[Peregrin Took]] and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and transported them to [[Fangorn Forest]] in time to mobilise the [[Ents]]. Gandalf also suspected Saruman had found (and destroyed) the remains of [[Isildur]], who had worn the Ring before it had been lost.

Saruman's Shire network failed to capture Frodo Baggins, Gandalf rallied Rohan to victory, [[Éomer]] stopped his brutal, but only partially successful raiding party, and control of Isengard was lost to the Ents. Aware he was utterly defeated, Saruman briefly considered repenting for his deeds, but at the last moment could not go through with it. Whether he had hope he could escape, whether he was too proud to surrender to Gandalf, or whether he thought his master would pardon him, Saruman refused to leave the confines of his fortress. Saruman made a final attempt to woo Théoden and Gandalf to his cause but failed: his staff was broken and he was expelled from the Order of the Istari.

Left out of the final stages of the War of the Ring and unable to be of any use to Sauron, he eventually managed to convince his captors, the Ents, to let him leave Isengard, as apparently the magic of his voice still remained.

[[File:Valera Lutfullina - Nasty End.jpg|thumb|200px|right|"Nasty End" by [[:Category:Art by Valera Lutfullina|Valera Lutfullina]]]]

On their way to northern [[Dunland]], on [[28 August]]<ref name="chief">{{App|Chief}}</ref> they were confronted by Gandalf, [[Celeborn]], Galadriel and the Hobbits, but they passed as travelling beggars as Saruman kicked Gríma to move on, and he exclaimed how he hated his lord. Gandalf told Gríma that he was free to leave him but he did not reply. As Saruman was considered powerless, there was little concern for his escape.<ref name="Partings">{{RK|Partings}}</ref> On [[22 September]]<ref name="chief" /> they entered to the Shire, which his ally [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]] (undisturbed by events elsewhere) had brought under control. He established himself in [[Hobbiton]] and spent his final days as a small-time thug lord whom his [[ruffians]] called Sharkey, imposing a terror regime to avenge himself upon the peaceful Halflings. But even this operation fell apart after Frodo and [[Samwise Gamgee]] returned; he was eventually betrayed and killed by his own agent Gríma on [[3 November]], {{TA|3019}}.

Saruman, who was a Maia, had lost his shape with his "death". As a discorporate spirit, he turned westward, but a wind came from the [[West]] and pushed him away. Apparently his spirit was left naked, powerless, and wandering in Middle-earth, not unlike Sauron after the One Ring was destroyed.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Gregor Roffalski - Curunír.jpg|thumb|''Curunír'' by [[:Category:Images by Gregor Roffalski|Gregor Roffalski]]]]
In appearance, Saruman was as an old man with black hair. At the end of the Third Age, his hair and beard had turned mostly white — he had only black hairs about his lips and ears. He was tall, his face was long, and his eyes were deep and dark.<ref name="Voice"/> He would appear in a white cloak, a habit he later changed into a cloak that changed colours as he moved.

He was not actually a [[Men|Man]], or even an Elf (as Men often suspected), but a Maia clothed in flesh — an Istar (see ''Origins'' above). As such, he was immortal and extremely powerful, yet had limits on how far these powers could be used. His two most salient powers were his knowledge and his voice. Saruman was, in a very real way, the junior brother of Sauron both having been Maia of Aulë, Valar of Smithcraft, in the very beginnings of time. The parallels between Sauron and Saruman in both character and actions are many.

===Powers===
Knowledge of the "deep arts" (or magic, such as it is in Middle-earth) was of particular interest to Saruman, especially when relating to power such as the Rings of Power and the far-seeing ''palantíri''. He was also deeply learned in ancient lore regarding powerful kingdoms such as [[Númenor]], [[Gondor]], and [[Moria]]. 

His voice and speech were extremely convincing, more powerful than mere rhetoric. When he focused this power on a person or a group of people, he could sway their hearts, plant fears and sow lies as he pleased. According to the stature of the listener, this spell could last as long as the speech did, or it could take root in them and last forever. Saruman's voice was so powerful that he was able to convince the Witch-king that he knew nothing of the One-Ring or the Shire.<ref>{{Cite DTP|UT 3.04.01.013}}</ref> His voice was not hypnotic, however, rather it was persuasive; and the real danger the voice posed to the listener was not them falling into a trance, but agreeing with it.<ref>{{Cite DTP|LR 3.10.045}}</ref>

Aside from his voice, Saruman has other subtle abilities such as giving great speed and motivation to his orcs at a distance and setting his will against all those in his dominion that might oppose him. Aragorn takes note of this ability while tracking the party of orcs holding Merry and Pippin hostage. Saruman also seems to be able to move around totally unheard by others, as there are numerous examples of him using this ability. Several examples include his sneaking up on Aragorn, [[Gimli]] and [[Legolas]]'s camp in [[The Riders of Rohan]], his wholly unheard entrance in [[The Voice of Saruman]] and his quiet but sudden appearance to the hobbits in [[The Scouring of the Shire]]. 

Other powers include knowledge of machinery and chemistry, probably separable from explicit magic (for instance, the "blasting fire" employed by his Uruk-hai army in the battle of [[Helm's Deep]], was some kind of chemical explosive). Machinery and engines characterised both his fortified Isengard and his altered Shire arenas of influence. In this, he sought to emulate, or even surpass his ally, Sauron. This inclination was constitutional in them both from the very beginning.

His science also extended to biological areas. He is believed to have crossbred Men and Orcs, creating a new race of Orcs unafraid of daylight, the dreaded Uruk-hai, a major improvement on Sauron's thralls who hated daylight. His mannish spies in Bree were said to have Orc blood, giving them heightened senses over ordinary men. He also employed scavenger birds in his service, although this might also be attributed to [[Radagast]] the Brown, ordering them to report to Orthanc, Saruman's stronghold.

Being regarded as more powerful than Gandalf (at least before Gandalf's "rebirth"), it's fair to assume he would also wield explicit magic similar to Gandalf, such as artificial light, locking spells, creating fire, etc.

Saruman, walking on the same ruinous path as Sauron, attempted to forge for himself a Ring of Power. This he wore during the War of the Ring which he revealed when he called himself "Saruman the [[Ring-maker]]".<ref name="FRCouncil" /> He had great knowledge and lore of the magic rings created by Sauron and by the Elven-smiths, though at this time the full art of ring-making was lost and known only to Sauron and so Saruman's knowledge of the craft was incomplete. It is assumed that Saruman's Ring was the equivalent of one of the lesser rings in power and any details of this power are not mentioned. It is also assumed that it too lost its power, if it had any, when the One Ring was destroyed, since Saruman's craft of ring-making was still based on Sauron's. When Gandalf was given Narya, the Ring of Fire, Saruman learned of the gift and resented it. This may be another reason why Saruman desired to have a ring of his own.

===Personality===
Saruman resembled Gandalf not only in appearance, but originally also somewhat in deportment, but unlike Gandalf, Saruman was proud, even haughty, and in this he was more akin to Sauron. He saw himself as the most powerful of the Istari, expressing clear contempt for Radagast the Brown, patronising tolerance of the Wise and Elves, and sheer disdain for lesser Men. Saruman was no fool (though he saw Radagast as one); he realised Gandalf's power, and eventually came to see him as an equal, and later as a superior, much to his distress. He became jealous of Gandalf, eventually convincing himself that Gandalf was scheming against him, which justified his own scheming against Gandalf and the rest of the White Council, and the Free Peoples of Middle-earth as well. Saruman's ultimate agenda, in the end, was not very different at all from Sauron's, in that he himself ultimately sought to become a tyrant of Middle-earth; regardless if by his new master's side or (more preferably) on his own - if he attained the One Ring First. 

Saruman likely was true to his mission in the beginning, and actually believed in working to stop the return of the Darkness, but his pride and later arrogance (as well as his jealousy towards Gandalf and domination by Sauron) turned him into a traitor to the cause he had once served. Saruman's betrayal was not sudden, but slowly grew over time as Sauron used Saruman's lust for power, admiration of strength and envy as tools of control, until at last Saruman had convinced himself that he could not have taken any other path and that it was too late now to repent. To the last the corrupted Wizard only believed in his own counsel and the deceptive words of the Dark Lord. These false beliefs kept Saruman from taking his last chance at redemption, and because he must have realised this after Gandalf's truly generous terms he only became more bitter and filled with the rage of failure, blaming Gandalf more than anyone else for his downfall.

==Politics==
===Men===
Saruman "went mostly among men". He always sought power, and it lay in the hands of the kingdoms of Men.

No records speak of his earliest journeys into the east; after his return he became a servant of Gondor, receiving the keys to Orthanc from Beren as its warden. When Gondor weakened, he claimed Orthanc for his own without any formal declaration (or objection from Gondor), yet remained nominally an ally of Gondor and of Rohan.<ref name="AppEorl" /> 

When he turned to treachery, Saruman employed men mainly from Dunland, and agents from other lands, turning old grudges into fuel for new hatred. The Dunlendings were enticed with the old stories that they had once lived in [[Calenardhon]] before the ''Strawheads''. The Dunlendings became his soldiers and it also seems probable that he used some of them to create [[Half-orcs]].

Gríma Wormtongue played a vital role in Saruman's plans: with Saruman's counsel Gríma began to weaken the king, estranging him from his other counsellors and even his own kin, until Gríma had in effect become the leader of Rohan.

===Elves=== 
Saruman was once on good terms with the Elves, and was voted in as the leader of the White Council, a group of Elves and Istari united against Sauron. 

Saruman knew that Gandalf had been given the third Elvish ring Narya by Círdan the Shipwright. This nurtured his jealousy of Gandalf and his resentment towards the Elves. 

Saruman had little use for, or interest in, the Elves, who were declining and their lands were few and secretive; although they wielded marvellous powers and two Rings of Power, they were not useful nor accessible for Saruman's ambitions. Also, they succumbed less easily than other races to manipulation. 

Even though Isengard lay very close to [[Lothlórien]], Saruman had very little or no contact with it. Saruman never trusted Galadriel and he accused her of scheming for Gandalf at his expense.<ref name="Partings" />

===Orcs===
Saruman drew his original strength of Orcs from tribes in the [[Misty Mountains]], and perhaps from Moria Orcs. He made use of [[Wargs|Warg]]-mounted Orcs for raids against Rohan.

He also bred [[Orcs of Isengard|Orcs]] in the pits of Isengard, eventually creating crossbreeds of Orcs and Men (probably Dunlendings or [[Bree-men]]) This programme apparently also involved feeding these greater Orcs Man-flesh as a treat.

His Uruk-hai legions displayed great discipline and fierce loyalty, in addition to the other improvements such as height, strength, endurance and resistance to sunlight. There also appears to have been middle stages between Men and the Uruk-hai, Men with varying degrees of Orkish appearance such as [[Half-orcs]] and [[Goblin-men]]. These were reported by Pippin and Merry to have been part of Saruman's regular army, but were not Uruk-hai, since the hobbits would have recognised these from their earlier capture. 

Saruman's servants called him "[[Sharkey]]" both in Isengard and later in the Shire.<ref name="Scouring" />

===Ents/Trees===
Saruman made contact with the Ents in Fangorn Forest shortly after he settled in Isengard. The oldest of the Ents, [[Treebeard]] received him and gave him free access to the forest.<ref name="Treebeard">{{TT|Treebeard}}</ref>

Saruman also consulted with Treebeard, learning much old lore that the Ents would have remembered from ancient times. Saruman did not return this favour, but only listened.<ref name="Treebeard" />

The Ents saw Saruman's treachery early, and became very concerned, primarily with Saruman's Orcs felling trees on the edge of Fangorn for use in the furnaces of Isengard and sometimes for no reason at all. 

The Ents also appear to have had a sense of order, how things should be, that Saruman encroached upon. The crossbreeding of Men and Orcs particularly alarmed them, out of proportion to other concerns enemies of Saruman might have had. Also alarming was the pure fact of his treachery — the Istari were supposed to have a special responsibility. 

Saruman used the Ents and the Fangorn forest without concern for the consequences. He clearly misjudged the Ents' abilities and will to act. This might not have been as incautious as it seemed, since major contributing factors to the Ent's actions were advice and requests from Gandalf, and concern about the rising power of Sauron (and their wish to support the front-line troops of the war, Rohan and Gondor). 

Saruman clearly had the ability to understand the minds of the Ents when he found it useful. He managed to talk Treebeard into setting him free from Orthanc by pushing just the right buttons — Ents dislike the concept of caging up any creature.

===Hobbits===
The race of Hobbits and their lands seemed too insignificant to interest Saruman: until he took notice of Gandalf's special concern for them. Studying Gandalf made him focus gradually more and more on the Hobbits and The Shire. For a period he actually travelled there in secret, mapping out the lands. Gandalf was aware of this, but at this point only amused.

He began smoking pipe-weed (a habit of the Hobbits that Gandalf had picked up), also in secret. His demand for tobacco opened up trading between The Shire and Isengard, and the power his money could wield there and the corruption it could cause began to fascinate him. Some of his agents went in secret, and some were known to Gandalf and the [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]].

His anger towards the Hobbits may possibly stem from the attention Gandalf showed them. It certainly strengthened immensely when he discovered that the Hobbits had "conspired" with Gandalf to keep the One Ring from him.

This, and the sudden urgency caused by the Ringwraiths' hunt for the Ring-bearer from The Shire to Rivendell, made him increase his activity in the area, leading to a build-up of power that would lead to virtual conquest of The Shire. 

He might also later have blamed the ruin of Isengard by the Ents on Peregrin Took and Meriadoc Brandybuck, who clearly catalysed events. 

This all came together when Saruman escaped from the Ents and retired to The Shire and his thug regime in place there. It appears he immediately switched the focus of this operation to wanton destruction: pollution, murder, fire, chopping down trees for no reason, a last blow against Hobbits and Gandalf.

At his final utter defeat by [[Battle of Bywater|a Hobbit uprising]], his life was spared even when he tried to assassinate Frodo Baggins. At this moment he actually conceded a short-lived respect to Frodo.

===Valar/Maiar/Wizards=== 
Saruman was supposedly eager to go to Middle-earth, against Manwë's counsel. After his 'death' he was apparently barred from returning to Valinor, and therefore was denied reincarnation and condemned to waft away and disappear like so much smoke.<ref name="Scouring">{{FR|Scouring}}, p. 1020</ref> In his corrupt state, Saruman sought power and the imposing of order in Middle-earth by any means necessary, even if it meant betraying the mission he was entrusted with and throwing in his lot with Sauron.

Sauron, in origin a Maia of Aulë like Saruman, awed and frightened him. During the height of his arrogance, Saruman thought he could contend with Sauron, but in the end he found himself meddling with a spirit of far greater power and knowledge than himself. Caught peering into the ''palantír'' he was seduced by Sauron to his allegiance, no longer opposing (and perhaps even desiring) his victory. The Wizard sought to become the quasi-equal lieutenant to Sauron and receive his favour in triumph, yet he was proved to be a duplicitous ally by actively coveting the One Ring. After the Escape of Gandalf, Saruman understood the only paths ahead of him were to: show Sauron his loyalty by crippling Rohan, hoping to at the very least be spared, or claim the Ring first; otherwise he would come to ruin and torment. 

Saruman grudgingly brought with him Radagast as a companion from Valinor, at the request of Yavanna, yet still managed to arrive alone, and first. Shortly after, he went into the East with the two Blue Wizards, and later returned alone. There he may have wrought many great works to diminish the influence of the Enemy or searched for lore to help him in his schemes.

Radagast, even though Saruman scorned him, served both Gandalf and Saruman very usefully (and wholly unintentionally, as he admitted "he had just the wit to play the part I set him", that of persuading Gandalf to come to Isengard).<ref>{{FR|Council}}, p. 258</ref> Radagast also sent birds to Saruman and Gandalf to report the different happenings in Middle-earth. 

Saruman had always been jealous of Gandalf, and knew that he was keeping secrets from him, such as his suspicion about Bilbo's ring and Narya, secret. Gandalf also suspected Saruman of plotting to gain the One Ring for himself, and hinted at this at a meeting of the White Council. Gandalf blew nine small smoke rings and one great one that wavered a bit, seeming almost palpable, and yet blew away, symbolising (almost prophetic of) Saruman's failure in achieving the One. In general, Saruman must have viewed Gandalf as his only peer, and as such to be feared and treated with (although not necessarily shown) respect. He always kept a watchful eye open for Gandalf's doings, and actually picked up the habit of smoking pipe-weed by sending out spies tailing Gandalf to the Shire. After revealing his fealty to Mordor and his desire for the Ring, Saruman offered Gandalf the chance to join with Sauron, or perhaps get the One for themselves. Ultimately, certain that Gandalf could be forced to tell of the Ring's whereabouts or that at least Sauron would prevail, he came to underestimate Gandalf and think little of his interventions.

Nevertheless, Saruman exercised more power than Gandalf, even with the ring Narya, as became clear when he placed Gandalf under arrest at the pinnacle of Orthanc. The text does not make it clear whether Saruman lost power or whether Gandalf gained power, but when Gandalf returned as "Gandalf [[the White]]", he could summon Saruman at his will, forcibly keep him in his presence, and finally break Saruman's staff (with whatever implications that might have had for Saruman's powers). 

Despite his apparent disdain for the Grey Pilgrim, Saruman several times came very close to setting aside his pride and asking Gandalf for pity and help. The closest call came when the Ringwraiths (on their way to the Shire) arrived at Isengard while Gandalf still remained in captivity there. Saruman, realising he might have already lost Sauron's trust, actually went to seek Gandalf's pardon, only to find his erstwhile captive missing from the top of Orthanc.

===Animals===
Saruman had control over many birds, probably having been taught to tame them by Radagast. [[Crebain]] spied for him and brought him news.<ref>{{FR|South}}</ref> In addition, the Orcs Saruman took in his armies had amongst them wild [[Wolves]] and even [[Wargs]], a sort of demonic cousin of the former.

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the earlier versions of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Saruman was sketched merely as a fawning servant of [[Sauron]], while the army he musters is not in rivalry of [[Mordor]]'s but from the beginning in his new master's employ. In other drafts, the treacherous [[Wizards|Wizard]] hands [[Gandalf]] over to the evil [[Giants|Giant]] [[Treebeard]] or betrays him to the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]].<ref name="FRCouncil" />

Saruman's older names in these drafts were Sarumond and Saramund,<ref name="rc">{{HM|RC}}, p. xxiii</ref> containing the English term ''mund'' "hand".

==Inspiration==
Saruman was invented and introduced in the story in order to explain [[Gandalf]]'s absence in the first part of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', replacing [[Treebeard]] as the [[Wizards|Wizard]]'s captor.<ref name="rc" />

===Films===
'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:[[Fraser Kerr]] provided the voice of Saruman. From early on in the production, it was decided that "Saruman" and "[[Sauron]]" sounded too much alike, and might confuse viewers. On concept art, Saruman is called Ruman,<ref>[http://www.ralphbakshi.com/gallery/displayimage.php?album=5&pos=69 1978 - The Lord of the Rings Gallery] at [http://www.ralphbakshi.com Ralphbakshi.com] (accessed 26 March 2011)</ref> but prior to recording, this was changed to Aruman. However, during recording, it was again changed, to "Saruman". Because of this late change, several instances of "Aruman" remain in the finished film.

'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''
:Saruman was played by [[Christopher Lee]]. Saruman's depiction in the series is more akin to the early drafts: he is a more committed vassal of Sauron; still, he is seemingly not above cheating his master, instructing [[Lurtz]] to bring him the Hobbits carrying "something of great value" (the [[The One Ring|One Ring]]). In the films, his corruption by Sauron is directly portrayed to have come about through his use of one of the ''[[Palantíri]]'' found in the tower of [[Orthanc]], through which Sauron fueled the lust for power and accompanying arrogance and greed already festering in Saruman's heart. The films did not include the [[Scouring of the Shire]], so Saruman's last appearance was in [[Isengard]], during his encounter with [[Gandalf]] and Théoden. In the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (extended edition)|extended edition of ''The Return of the King'']], [[Gríma]] stabs Saruman in the back, causing him to fall on a spiked wheel below the tower of Orthanc.

'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:'''
:Christopher Lee reprised his role as Saruman, although the character does not appear in the book.<ref name="TelegraphCasting">{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/8311016/Christopher-Lee-will-star-in-the-Hobbit-prequel.html|articlename=Christopher Lee will star in the Hobbit prequel|dated=08-Feb-2011|website=[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/ The Telegraph]|accessed=21-Dec-2011}}</ref> He appears as part of the [[White Council]] alongside Gandalf, [[Galadriel]], and [[Elrond]]. He is sceptical about the appearance of a [[Sauron#Sauron's Return|Necromancer]] in [[Dol Guldur]]. However, when he participates in the attack on Dol Guldur, he sees for himself that Sauron has indeed returned. After the skirmish, he appears shaken by the display of Sauron's power, but claims he will take it upon himself to keep an eye on the Dark Lord and pretends to care for Lady Galadriel's weakened state.

'''2024: ''[[The War of the Rohirrim]]'':''' 
:Christopher Lee posthumously voices Saruman through an archival recording. Saruman appears at the end of the film, introduced to the newly crowned king, [[Fréaláf Hildeson]], as the newly appointed master of Isengard, and he assures Fréaláf that Rohan has Isengard's support.

===Television===
'''1993: ''[[Hobitit]]'':'''
:Saruman was played by actor Mikko Kivinen. He appears only in the "Vanha metsä" ("Old Forest") episode.

===Radio series===
'''1955: [[The Lord of the Rings (1955 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1955 radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of Saruman is provided by [[Robert Farquharson]].

'''1979: [[The Lord of the Rings (1979 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1979 radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of Saruman is provided by [[James Arrington]].

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:''' 
:[[Peter Howell]] played Saruman. Because the series follows a chronological timeline rather than the flashbacks of the books, Saruman's betrayal is brought out much sooner than in the book. Excerpts from "[[The Hunt for the Ring]]" are dramatised to flesh out Gandalf's escape from Isengard, and the [[Nazgûl]]'s pursuit. The hobbits do not meet him on the road back to Rivendell. In the final episode, Saruman's death at the hands of Wormtongue at [[Bag End]] is included.

'''1992: [[Der Herr der Ringe (1992 German radio series)|''Der Herr der Ringe'' (1992 German radio series)]]:'''
:Saruman is played by Manfred Steffen.

'''2001-2003: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of Saruman is provided by Andrej Hryc. Saruman appears in all three series (seasons) of this adaptation, with his most prominent appearances in the episodes covering ''The Two Towers''.

===Games===
'''2003: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' (video game)]]:'''
:Though Christopher Lee provided the voice of Saruman for many scenes, the only visual appearance of the Wizard of from re-used movie clips, his voice is played over several of Gandalf's actions.

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring]]'':'''
:Saruman is one of the "Hero" units of the Servants of Sauron, the game also depicts his creation of the Uruk-hai.

'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'':'''
:Saruman is the main "Hero" unit of the Isengard faction, the evil campaign follows his despoilment of both Isengard and the [[Fangorn Forest]], war on [[Rohan]] and later conquest of the outlying lands.

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:Saruman is still the main "Hero" unit of the Isengard faction but plays no role in the storyline.

'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Rise of Isengard]]'':'''
:Though frequently referred to in-game since 2007, Saruman made no visual appearance until 2011 and the ''Rise of Isengard'' expansion. Many quests in the game display the stretch of the [[White Hand]] - Saruman's minions are present in the Shire as early as {{TA|3018}}, as well as [[Bree-land]], [[Lone-lands]], [[Eregion]], [[Enedwaith]], [[Dunland]], [[Gap of Rohan]], outskirts of the Fangorn Forest and even [[Moria]].
:In the storyline of ''Rise of Isengard'' Saruman first appears buying the loyalties of the [[Dunlendings|Dunlending]] clans, bringing with him riches and maintaining a friendly appearance. He also still keeps his affairs in Rohan private, to the point that when a [[Rohirrim]] questions the desolation of [[Nan Curunír|''Nan Curunír'']] and the presence of [[Trolls]] in Isengard, the Wizard manages to use his voice to convince him that it was all for the good cause. At one point, traitorous Dunlendings capture the player and send him to Saruman as a gift - once again the Wizard maintains a friendly and noble appearance, trying to discern the location of The Ring, before the player escapes.
:A major storyline is derived from a single line in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', where Saruman calls himself "Ring-forger". Long having researched the [[Rings of Power]], Saruman sends his minions to pillage what remains of Ring-Forges of Eregion, looking for any knowledge of ancient [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain|Elven smiths]] that have remained here. Using that lore, he constructs a massive Ring-Forge under Isengard, where he creates five lesser rings and a master one to command them. He keeps the master ring to himself and gives the other to his most trusted lieutenants, though none of the mortals are prepared for it and are turned into monstrosities. A large force of players defeats them one by one, reclaiming lesser rings and later use those rings to turn upon the master one. In the ensuing fight Saruman's ring is destroyed shortly before the [[Battle of the Hornburg|Battle of Hornburg]], and with it the lesser ones lose their power.

'''2014: [[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]:'''
:Voiced by [[Roger Jackson]], Saruman appears in this game as a non-playable character. The game's protagonist, [[Talion]], finds various artefacts that reveal that Saruman's spies are active within the borders of Mordor in the years between ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. It is later revealed that Saruman was controlling Queen Marwen of the [[Nurnen]] to hinder Sauron while bringing about the destruction of the men of [[Nurn]].
