'''Will Whitfoot''' was the [[Mayor of Michel Delving]] during the [[War of the Ring]].

==History==
Whitfoot was elected Mayor at the [[Free Fair]] late in the [[Third Age]], at least as late as {{SR|1413}}.<ref group=note>The date is not given by [[Tolkien]], but is suggested as possible by [[Robert Foster]]. Since the Free Fair is septennial, Will must have been Mayor since the last Fair before {{TA|3020}} (3020-7={{TA|3013|n}}). However, as we are not told that was his first term, it's possible that he might already been serving since {{TA|3006}} or even earlier. See {{HM|Guide}}, p. 428, entry "Will Whitfoot".</ref>

He was renowned as being the fattest hobbit in the [[Westfarthing]], and was affectionately referred to as "Flourdumpling" after he emerged from the collapse of the [[Town Hole]] covered in chalk. [[Peregrin Took]] later caused a great deal of laughter at the [[Prancing Pony]] when he related that incident to the [[Bree-folk]].<ref>{{FR|I9}}</ref> 

He was one of the first victims of the new rule of [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]] and [[Sharkey]]. He went to protest against Lotho's felling of trees, but was apprehended by [[Ruffians]] on his way to [[Bag End]]. He was locked up in the [[Lockholes]], and Lotho usurped his title.<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref> He was freed after the [[Battle of Bywater]], but was at first unfit for duty as Mayor, so [[Frodo Baggins]] served as Deputy Mayor.<ref>{{RK|Havens}}</ref> He was officially restored as Mayor on the next Free Fair, on [[Midyear's Day]] of {{SR|1420}}.<ref name="Later">{{App|Later}}</ref>

Will Whitfoot resigned in {{SR|1427}}, and was succeeded by [[Samwise Gamgee]].<ref name="Later"/>

==Etymology==
The name "Whitfoot" is derived from "White foot".<ref>{{HM|N}}</ref>
