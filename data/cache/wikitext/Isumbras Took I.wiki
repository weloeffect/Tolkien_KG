'''Isumbras Took''' was a the thirteenth [[Thain]] of [[the Shire]].

==History==
Isumbras was elected Thain in {{SR|740}},<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> after [[Gorhendad Oldbuck]] relocated to [[Buckland]].<ref>{{FR|I5}}</ref> From then on, the Thain was a title held by the [[Took Family]].<ref>{{App|Took}}</ref>

==Etymology==
"Isumbras" is of French and [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] origin and means "iron-arm". It comes from the French ''bras'' meaning "arm", and the Anglo-Saxon and Middle High German word ''[[isen]]'' which means "iron".<ref>[[Jim Allan]], ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', "Giving of Names"</ref>

[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] likely got the name from ''[[wikipedia:Sir Isumbras|Sir Isumbras]]'', an English medieval romance about a man who suffers a lifetime of hardship but who finds happiness in his latter years.
