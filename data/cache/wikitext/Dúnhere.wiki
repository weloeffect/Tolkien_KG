'''Dúnhere''' was the chieftain of the folk of [[Harrowdale]], and a valiant captain who fought in the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]] and the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].

==History==
Dúnhere was a nephew of [[Erkenbrand]].<ref>{{UT|11a}}, note 13</ref> He was the chieftain of the folk of [[Harrowdale]] and the lord of Harrowdale.<ref name=Muster>{{RK|Muster}}</ref>

He served under [[Grimbold]] in the [[Battles of the Fords of Isen]]. Grimbold placed all the riders for whom horses were available under the command of Dúnhere to cover the retreat of his forces to the south in the night after the [[Second Battle of the Fords of Isen]].<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref>

Dúnhere did not accompany [[Gandalf]] and Erkenbrand to the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], but went to [[Edoras]] instead. [[Gandalf]] counselled him and the other captains to assemble the riders of Rohan in Harrowdale and to await King [[Théoden]] there, rather than in the open fields around Edoras, and to light as few fires as possible. Several days later, [[Théoden]] and the rest of the riders mustered there for the ride to [[Minas Tirith]].<ref name=Muster/>

Dúnhere was slain at the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. He was remembered in the [[Song of the Mounds of Mundburg]].<ref>{{RK|Battle}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Dúnhere'' means "hill warrior" in [[Old English]], consisting of ''[[Wiktionary:dun#Old English|dūn]]'' ("hill") + ''[[Wiktionary:here#Old English|here]]'' ("army, host").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 571</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2015: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Dúnhere is the Lord of [[Dunharrow]] and a nearby small village of [[Underharrow]]. He left his wife Ellen Fremedon in charge before departing with [[Erkenbrand]] for the Fords. The player sees Dúnhere shortly before the [[battle of Helm's Deep]] but not does get a chance to interact with him. They do not meet properly until the [[Druadan Forest]] on the day before the Rohirrim army arrives to [[Minas Tirith]]. Dúnhere is slain by an arrow during the [[battle of the Pelennor Fields]].
