==Gollum==
When he heard from his agent that [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0399193/ John Hubbard] wanted to hear him as the voice of an animated character, Serkis originally felt dismayed. When told it was Gollum, it changed little: he had read ''[[The Hobbit]]'' when he was eight, but nothing else. Not until his (later) wife Lorraine convinced him to go to the audition did he actually think of doing it. 

He recorded a demo, in which he portrayed Gollum full of self-pity and guilt, and he based the gulping swallow sound "gollum" on his cat Diz coughing up a furball. 

At the advice of [[Fran Walsh]], he kept a diary, and this diary was later edited to become ''[[Gollum: How We Made Movie Magic]]''. It details his casting, the shooting, the additional motion capture, and the voice dubbing pick-ups. 

Serkis spent a total of five years in [[New Zealand]], and did extra work later in London. He dubbed most of his lines as Gollum there, and also provided an eerie voice for the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]]. Together with [[Jim Dunk]], he also voiced most of the [[Uruk-hai]] in [[Uglúk]]'s troop.

==Quotes==
{{quote|They're only scorned because they're into something popular. But it's just the same as supporting a football team or being madly into Picasso or Brahms. And it's certainly a lot more fun than chess.| Andy Serkis on [[Tolkien fandom]], [http://tinyurl.com/6lxkxr Interview]}}
{{quote|This must be totally bizarre to them. I mean, at least when I look up at them I see [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], and I just play off them, but when they look at me, all they must see is a man in a gimp suit, with a face that makes Jim Carrey's look relaxed and a voice that sounds like a cat being sick.|Andy Serkis on filming with [[Elijah Wood]] and [[Sean Astin]], ''[[Gollum: How We Made Movie Magic]]''.}}
