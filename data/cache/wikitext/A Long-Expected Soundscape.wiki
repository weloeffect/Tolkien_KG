'''A Long-Expected Soundscape''' is an audio project created by Jordan Rannells, designed as a 3D audio dramatization of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]].'' It can also be used as a chapter-by-chapter accompaniment as people read the books. It can also be synchronized with the audiobooks read by [[Andy Serkis]] and [[Rob Inglis]]. '''A Long-Expected Soundscape''' encompasses layers of sound FX, ambient nature environmental sounds, and an original score.

The track titles match the titles of the book.
