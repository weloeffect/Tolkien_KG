'''Old Noakes''' was a [[hobbits|Hobbit]] from [[Bywater]]. 
==History==
Noakes was a regular at the [[Ivy Bush]], and a friend of [[Gaffer Gamgee|the Gaffer]]'s. He was present at his drink just before [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]]. Asking the Gaffer about [[Frodo Baggins]], he thought that he must be more than a half [[Brandybuck Family|a Brandybuck]], openly wondering why [[Drogo Baggins|anyone]] should look for [[Primula Brandybuck|a wife]] in [[Buckland]].<ref>{{FR|Party}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Noake(s) or Noke(s) is a real-life English surname, derived probably from the place-name No(a)ke, etymologized as ''atten oke'' "at the oak".<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 761</ref>
