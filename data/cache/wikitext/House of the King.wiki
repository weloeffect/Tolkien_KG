The '''house of the King''' was one of the [[twelve houses of the Gondothlim]], the kindreds of the elven city of [[Gondolin]]. Their story is recounted in an early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. 

==History==
The folk of this house were under the personal command of King [[Turgon]] of [[Gondolin]]. They dressed in white, gold and red, and their emblem combined the [[moon]], the [[sun]] and the [[scarlet heart]].<ref name=Gondolin>{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|172}} 

During the [[Fall of Gondolin]], Turgon watched most of the battle from [[Tower of the King|his tower]],<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|180}} while his folk were held in reserve in the [[Square of the Palace]], remaining fresh in order to defend the king.<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|183}} There they remained untouched until the remnants of all the other kindreds gathered at the Square, but after [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs]] was slain by [[Ecthelion|Ecthelion of the Fountain]], the King came down and joined his folk against the [[Orcs]]. Their attack was so strong that they retook much of the Square and even slew two score [[Balrogs]]. They forced one of the terrible [[Fire-drakes]] into the [[Fountain of the King]], and there it perished, though the water did also. Yet many of them were killed by the heat, the serpents, the enemy, and one another, for the steam that rose from the fountain obscured their view. A body of them saved the king, and there was a rally beneath [[Glingol]] and [[Bansil]].<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|184}} Under those trees, Turgon proclaimed the fall of Gondolin and ordered the Gondothlim to follow his son-by-marriage, [[Tuor]], and evacuate the city. Tuor obeyed, but the men of the royal house said: ''"Here we will stay if Turgon goes not forth"''. They did not budge a foot, gathering around the base of the king's tower.<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|185}} No more is said of this house, but they probably perished with Turgon when the tower was beset and knocked down.<ref name=Gondolin/>{{rp|187}}

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the later version of the ''[[Quenta Noldorinwa]]'', there is only a glimpse of Turgon's folk: here is mentioned "the defence of the tower of Turgon by the men of his household, until the tower was overthrown".<ref>{{SM|Q16}}, p. 144</ref> Notice that this was the text used by [[Christopher Tolkien]] for the [[Of Tuor and the Fall of Gondolin|twenty-third chapter]] of his edition of ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.
