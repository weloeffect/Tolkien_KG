'''Folca''' ({{TA|2804}} – {{TA|2864}}, aged 60 years) was the thirteenth [[King of Rohan]].<ref name=Folca>{{App|Mark}}, ''Second Line'', entry 2804-64 13. ''Folca'', p. 1069</ref>

==History==
Folca was the son of King [[Walda]], who was born in a time when his country was still plagued by [[Orcs]]<ref name=Walda>{{App|Mark}}, ''Second Line'', entry 2780-2851 12. ''Walda'', p. 1069</ref> who had invaded Rohan after the [[War of Dwarves and Orcs]].<ref>{{App|Mark}}, ''Second Line'', entry 2752-2842 11. ''Brytta'', p. 1068</ref> At the time of his grandfather [[Brytta]]'s death it was believed that Rohan had been freed of the Orcs. However, some Orcs remained, and in {{TA|2851|n}} after ruling just nine years Walda and all his companions were killed by Orcs when they rode from [[Dunharrow]] on mountain paths.<ref name=Walda/>

Folca was a great hunter, but he swore not to hunt wild beasts as long as there were Orcs left in Rohan. During his life all orc-holds in Rohan were destroyed.<ref name=Folca/>

After Rohan had been cleared of Orcs, Folca went to the [[Firienholt|Firienwood]] to hunt the great [[Boar of Everholt]]. He managed to kill the boar, but suffered a mortal wound from the beast's tusks.<ref name=Folca/> He was buried in the fourth mound on the east-side of the Barrow-field<ref>{{RK|Partings}}, p. 977</ref> on the left side of the road that approached Edoras<ref>{{TT|King}}, p. 507</ref> from the north-west.<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref> Folca  was succeeded by his son [[Folcwine]].<ref>{{App|Mark}}, ''Second Line'', entry 2830-2903 14. ''Folcwine'', p. 1069</ref>

==Etymology==
''Folca'' is derived from [[Old English]] ''folc'', which means "folk" or "people".<ref>{{HM|RC}}. p. 644</ref>
