'''Fréaláf Hildeson''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2726|n}} – {{TA|2798|n}}, aged 72 years) was the tenth [[King of Rohan]], and the first King of the second line. 

==History==
Fréaláf was the son of [[Hild]], and thus the sister-son of [[Helm|Helm Hammerhand]]. When [[Rohan]] was invaded by the [[Dunlendings]] led by [[Wulf]] in {{TA|2758}}, Fréaláf was among the [[Rohirrim]] who took refuge in [[Dunharrow]]. However King Helm and his sons were killed in the invasion and the siege of the [[Hornburg]] in {{TA|2759|n}}, and Fréaláf was his heir.

Early in the spring Fréaláf led a daring surprise raid against the Dunlendings that recaptured [[Edoras]] and managed to reclaim it. With aid from [[Gondor]], he eventually drove the [[Dunlendings]] back across both the rivers [[Isen]] and [[Adorn]], freeing all of Rohan.<ref name="Eorl">{{App|Eorl}}</ref>  Those Dunlendings who had occupied [[Isengard]] were starved until they capitulated and left the fortress.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, Appendix (ii)</ref>

At his coronation the [[Wizard]] [[Saruman]] suddenly appeared after years of absence. Saruman offered Fréaláf his support and friendship which Fréaláf accepted, as Rohan was just recovering from the war and the [[Long Winter]]. On Fréaláf's advice, [[Beren (Steward of Gondor)|Beren]], [[Ruling Steward|Steward]] of [[Gondor]], lent Saruman the keys to [[Orthanc]], giving him Isengard to dwell in on the condition that he must protect it from another conquest by the Dunlendings.

He ruled for 39 years, and was succeeded by his son [[Brytta|Brytta Léofa]] at his death in 2798.<ref name="Eorl"/>

==Etymology==
''Fréaláf'' is an [[Old English]] name. It means "surviving lord" and consists of ''fréa'' ("lord") and ''laf'' ("leaving").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 643</ref>
