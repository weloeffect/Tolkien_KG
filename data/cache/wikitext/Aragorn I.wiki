'''Aragorn I''' ({{TA|2227}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 196</ref> - {{TA|2327|n}},<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 100) was the son of [[Aravir]], and fifth [[Chieftain of the Dúnedain]].

==History==
Little is known of his life as it was during the [[Watchful Peace]], other than that he succeeded his father when Aravir died in 2319. It is likely that his short rule was uneventful, with small battles to free the lands of evil. 

Indeed, after having ruled as Chieftain for only eight years, his life was cut short in {{TA|2327}}, when he was killed by wild [[wolves]] in [[Eriador]] (which were always a peril in that land). He was succeeded by his son [[Araglas]].<ref name="North"/><ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

==Etymology==
{{seealso|Aragorn#Etymology}}
Aragorn's name is [[Sindarin]], and means "Revered King", from ''[[ara]]'', a prefix for royalty, and ''gorn'' "revered".<ref>{{PE|17}}</ref>
