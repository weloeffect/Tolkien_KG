'''Lugdush''' was an [[Orcs|Orc]], and apparently an [[Uruk-hai|Uruk]], in the service of [[Saruman]]. He was a member of [[Uglúk]]'s raiding band that captured [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] beneath [[Amon Hen]], and drove them westwards to the eaves of [[Fangorn Forest]]. It was there that Lugdush met his end, at the hands of [[Éomer]]'s [[Rohirrim]].<ref>{{TT|III3}}</ref>

==Etymology==
It's possible that his name contains the [[Orcish]] element ''lug-'' ("fortress, lock-up, prison"<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 79</ref>) seen in the name for the [[Dark Tower]], ''Lugburz''.<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 241</ref>{{references}}
