'''Milo Burrows''' was a hobbit of [[the Shire]]. 

==History==
Milo was a grandson of [[Gorbadoc Brandybuck]] of [[Buckland]], who married into the [[Baggins Family]] when he wedded [[Peony Baggins|Peony]], and a nephew of both Bilbo and [[Frodo Baggins]]. They had four children - [[Mosco Burrows|Mosco]], [[Moro Burrows|Moro]], [[Myrtle Burrows|Myrtle]] and [[Minto Burrows|Minto]] - and all of the family was present at Bilbo's famous [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|Birthday Party]].<ref>{{App|Baggins}}</ref> 

Milo was known for his habit of failing to reply to letters, and because of this he was one of those that found a specially selected gift waiting for him in [[Bag End]], after Bilbo's departure: a golden inkpot and pen.<ref>{{FR|I1}}</ref>
