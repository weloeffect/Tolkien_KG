'''At the Green Dragon''' is the ninth scene of [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (extended edition)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (extended edition)]]. This scene was not featured in the theatrical release of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.

==Synopsis==
[[Frodo]] and [[Sam]] are at the [[Green Dragon]] inn in [[Bywater]]. [[Merry]] and [[Pippin]] are singing as well. Two older hobbits discuss rumors of strange creatures being seen in the [[Shire]] and fear the outbreak of a war. Sam pines after [[Rosie Cotton]]. Soon, the tavern closes and Frodo heads back to [[Bag End]].

==Differences==

The lyrics of Merry and Pippin's drinking song are adapted from two songs in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'': [[Ho! Ho! Ho! To the Bottle I Go]] from the chapter [[A Short Cut to Mushrooms]] and [[The Bath Song]] from [[A Conspiracy Unmasked]].

This scene could be interpreted as a very loose adaptation of a conversation in [[The Shadow of the Past|Chapter 2]] of the ''The Fellowship of the Ring''. The book does depict unrest in the Shire as dwarves and other beings flee the growing power of [[Sauron]].
