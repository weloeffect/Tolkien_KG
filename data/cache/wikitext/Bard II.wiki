'''Bard II''' was the son of [[Brand]] and heir to the [[Kingdom of Dale]].

==History==
During the [[War of the Ring]] his father was slain in the [[Battle of Dale]], and Bard with many [[Men of Dale]] and [[Dwarves of Erebor]] were forced back to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] by [[Easterlings]]. There he was besieged with his ally [[Thorin Stonehelm|Thorin III Stonehelm]] for several days. 

When news came from the south of the destruction of [[Sauron]], Bard and Thorin emerged from the Lonely Mountain and broke the siege.  Later he sent an ambassador to the crowning of King [[Aragorn|Elessar]] and thereafter his kingdom enjoyed the protection of the [[King of the West]].<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>
