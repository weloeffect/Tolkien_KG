'''Gróin''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2671|n}} - {{TA|2923|n}}, 252 years old) was a Dwarf of the [[Longbeards]].

==History==
Gróin was an important figure in the royal genealogies of the [[Dwarves]], Gróin was the grandson of [[Borin]], the younger son of King [[Náin II]], and so could claim direct descent from [[Durin|Durin the Deathless]] himself. In his turn, Gróin was the younger brother of [[Fundin]], father to [[Óin]] and [[Glóin]], and uncle to [[Balin]] and [[Dwalin]], all four of whom travelled on the [[Quest of Erebor]].<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>

Through his son Glóin, he was also grandfather to [[Gimli|Gimli Elf-friend]] of the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Company of the Ring]]. For all his genealogical importance, though, we know almost nothing of his life. His dates of birth and death, though, show us that he was alive at the time of [[Smaug]]'s [[Sack of Erebor]], and the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]] twenty-nine years later. It is likely that he was present at both these events.

==Etymology==
[[Jim Allan]] has suggested that ''Gróin'' (like ''[[Grór#Etymology|Grór]]'') is derived from [[Old Norse]] ''gróa'' ("to grow"), thus meaning "Growing-one".<ref>[[Jim Allan]], "Giving of Names", in ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', p. 225</ref>
