The '''Great Plague''', also known as the '''Dark Plague''', was a deadly plague that spread out of the [[Rhûn|east]] into [[Rhovanion]], [[Gondor]], and [[Eriador]] during the [[Third Age]]. The mortality rate of the epidemic possibly numbered in the hundreds of thousands as it killed untold numbers of people and animals.<ref name="south"/>

== History ==
[[File:Sage - Great Plague.png|thumb|left|The effects of the plague; more intense color shows worse effect (based on interpretation in the ''[[Atlas of Middle-earth]]'').]]

The Great Plague began beyond [[Mordor]] in [[Rhûn]]. It was believed by historians to have allegedly been caused by [[Sauron]] as the plague coincided with a [[Shadow]] deepening in [[Mirkwood]], foretelling his return in the unguarded [[Mordor]] and the reappearance of evil things.<ref name="south"/>

During the cold winter of {{TA|1635}}, the plague was brought by dark winds to [[Rhovanion]]. The [[Northmen]] suffered great casualties since they were less skilled in the art of healing than [[Gondor]] was. After the plague had passed, more than half of the folk of Rhovanion had been killed along with their horses.<ref>{{UT|Northmen}}</ref> The plague also hit the enemies of Gondor, who otherwise could easily have overwhelmed the weakened kingdom. Though this didn't affect [[Sauron]], as he could wait.<ref name="south"/>

The plague first reached [[Gondor]] in {{TA|1636}}, just a couple of years after King [[Minardil]] had been killed at [[Pelargir]] by the [[Corsairs of Umbar]]. It was devastating in Gondor; [[Calenardhon]] and [[Osgiliath]] were especially hit hard, with Calenardhon being nearly completely abandoned<ref>{{UT|Palantiri}}</ref> and Osgiliath suffering the highest casualties outside of [[Rhovanion]]. Many fled the city and removed to [[Ithilien]] and [[Anórien]], and [[Minas Anor]] became the [[King's House|King's seat]]. The casualties were so high that "[[Minas Ithil]] was emptied of its people"<ref>{{S|V}}, p. 296</ref> and the fortresses guarding [[Mordor]] were abandoned as the troops were recalled.<ref name="south"/> The new king, [[Telemnar]], was killed along with his children, many others of the [[Dúnedain]], and the [[White Tree of Gondor]].<ref name=ta>{{App|TA}}</ref> Coming two centuries after the [[Kin-strife]], this further destroyed the people of Gondor.<ref name="south">{{App|South}}</ref>

From there the plague spread west and then north, desolating many of the lands in [[Eriador]].<ref name=ta/> [[Dunland]] suffered less than most, due to having little contact with other regions.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref> However, the plague gained strength as it went north, and [[Cardolan]], [[Minhiriath]] in particular, was hit especially hard. The joint garrison of the North and South Kingdoms at [[Tharbad]] ceased to exist.<ref>{{UT|6d}}</ref> The last of the Dúnedain of Cardolan died on the [[Barrow-downs]], and evil spirits from [[Angmar]] and [[Rhudaur]] entered the realm.<ref name="north">{{App|North}}</ref>

While [[The Shire]] suffered greatly,<ref name=ta/> the plague lessened as it passed northward until the northern part of [[Arthedain]] was scarcely affected,<ref name="north"/> still being capable of defending [[Fornost Erain]] from Angmar.

The plague marked the beginning of the desolation of [[Eriador]],<ref name=ta/> where the population of [[Men]] continued to decline for the rest of the [[Age]].<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #59</ref> The exact date that the plague ended is not known, but for the next two centuries, Gondor, as well as its allies and enemies, did little but try to regain strength.<ref name="south"/>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In an early draft, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] states that the plague came from the [[Harad|south]] in addition to the east. In a rejected sentence in this version, the plague never passed the  [[Brandywine River]] into the Shire.<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, "The Northern Line of Arnor: the Isildurioni", entry for Argeleb II</ref>

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
'''2015: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The Great Plague is revealed to be an evil of [[Sauron]], created by his chief poisoner Lhaereth the Stained. Various versions of it were tested in [[Rhûn]] before a suitable variant was unleashed onto the lands in the west. However, despite the devastation it brought, the plague was deemed a failure by Sauron for not being deadly enough, and Lhaereth fell out of his favor for many years hence. It is revealed that the [[Rangers of the North]] could heal those affected by the plague with [[Athelas|Kingsfoil]]. After the downfall of Sauron, the player works with two Rangers to stop Lhaereth from unleashing a new and improved variant of the Great Plague.
