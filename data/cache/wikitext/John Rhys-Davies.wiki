==Quotes==
{{quote|There is an energetic ferocity in Gimli that the film needs. It's often these minor characters who really have to impart a sense of energy and dynamism to a film so that the heroes can actually take their time to respond and be thoughtful and reflective.|John Rhys-Davies, Southland Times, October 12th, 2000}}
