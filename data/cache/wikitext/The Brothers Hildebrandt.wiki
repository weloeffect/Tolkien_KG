'''The Brothers Hildebrandt''' were a duo of fantasy artists consisting of the twin brothers '''Greg Hildebrandt''' ([[23 January|January 23]], [[1939]] - [[October 31]], [[2024]]) and '''Tim Hildebrandt''' (January 23, [[1939]] – [[11 June|June 11]], [[2006]]).

The brothers have been recognized artists in the world of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]-inspired art. Other art includes the original poster art of ''[http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Art_of_the_Brothers_Hildebrandt Star Wars]'' and over a hundred ''[http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Hildebrandt_Brothers/Gallery Marvel Masterpieces]'', including ''Swimsuit Specials''. 

They created reference photographs prior to painting many of their pieces and both preferred to work on Masonite rather than Canvas.<ref>[https://steemit.com/blog/@inber/hildebrandt-brothers-tolkien-calendar-chapter-two-my-stories-about-illustrators-tom-bombadil Hildebrandt brothers Tolkien calendar - chapter two, my stories about illustrators:) Tom Bombadil]</ref>

Until Tim's death, the twins painted together, or in shifts, dependent of the time they had for a piece of art. After a struggle with diabetes, Tim passed away on [[11 June|June 11]], [[2006]].

After seeing [[The J.R.R. Tolkien Calendar 1975|a Tolkien calendar]] with [[Tim Kirk]]'s art, they responded to a call for artists by [[Ballantine Books|Ballantine]]. Their art was well-liked, and they were commissioned to illustrate the [[1976 J.R.R. Tolkien Calendar|1976 Ballantine calendar]]. 

More calendars followed: [[1977 J.R.R. Tolkien Calendar|1977]], [[1978 J.R.R. Tolkien Calendar|1978]] - and they sold a record one million calendars. They moved their scope to other large projects, but kept producing Tolkien artwork. In [[2001]], ''[[Greg and Tim Hildebrandt: The Tolkien Years]]'' was published by Greg's son, Gregory Jr. Following the release of this collection, Ballantine began to reissue their popular Tolkien Calendars starting in [[The Brothers Hildebrandt 2002 Calendar|2002]].
