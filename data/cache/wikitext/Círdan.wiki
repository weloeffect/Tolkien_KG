'''Círdan''' was one of the highest and most noble of the [[Sindar]],<ref name="Cirdan" /> lord of the [[Falas]] during the [[First Age]], and Master of the [[Grey Havens]] through the [[Second Age|Second]], [[Third Age|Third]], and [[Fourth Age]]. 

He was one of the wisest and most foresighted of the [[Elves]], and by the [[Second Age]], one of the oldest named [[Elves]] in [[Middle-earth]] to remain so throughout that age and into the [[Fourth Age]] as well.

He was also gifted [[Narya]], one of the [[Three Rings]], by [[Celebrimbor]] until he surrendered it to [[Gandalf]]. As the Lord of the Havens, he oversaw the departure of the Elves of Middle-earth to the West and eventually sought the [[Last Ship]] with his kinsman [[Celeborn]].{{fact}}

==History==
===First Age===
====Early life====
Círdan, born '''Nōwē''',<ref name="Cirdan" /> was kin of both [[Elwë]] and [[Olwë]], the kings of the [[Teleri]].<ref name="Cirdan" /> Of shipbuilding, whether by their first homes at [[Cuiviénen]] or when the [[Teleri]] dwelt by the [[Sea of Rhûn]], Nōwē was always the foremost and most skilled in the craft.<ref name="LastWritingsN" /> During the push westward, seeking to go to [[Valinor]], Nōwē and his followers kept going where most of his kin fell away throughout the journey.{{fact}}

Despite Nōwē's great eagerness to see the [[light of Valinor]] (his "greatest desire"),<ref name="Cirdan" /> he loyally searched for [[Elwë]] upon his disappearance. Because of this, the [[Teleri]] missed the first trip on [[Tol Eressëa]] to [[Valinor]], on which went their kin, the [[Noldor]] and the [[Vanyar]]. They took for their king [[Olwë]], and while waiting for [[Ulmo]] to return for them, Nōwē headed the art of making and sailing ships, growing impatient. From this profession he took the name "'''Círdan'''" which means "shipwright" in [[Sindarin]]. The [[Teleri]] also developed a great friendship with [[Ossë]]. At the same time, although most of the Teleri had given up, Círdan sought [[Elwë]] longer and harder than most of his kin, partly because of his love for him and his allegiance.<ref name="Cirdan" />

Because of this, Círdan came to the shores too late during the second embarking of Eressëa.<ref name="Cirdan" /> He came to the sands to find them departed, and as he stood forlorn he saw far-off a glimmer of light upon Eressëa as it vanished into the West over [[Belegaer]]. But into his heart came a message from the [[Valar]] which warned him that his ship could not endure the voyage, nor would any ship for many years, until the time when his work would be of utmost worth, remembered in song. Círdan answered in obeyance, and saw a vision of [[Vingilot|a ship]].<ref name="Cirdan" />

====Lord of the Falas====
=====Foundation=====
[[File:Peter Xavier Price - Cirdan, Lord of the Falathrim.jpg|225px|thumb|left|''Cirdan, Lord of the Falathrim'' by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]]
Círdan therefore remained with those Teleri who had chosen to stay east of the Sea for love of Ossë, and became their lord. The folk became known as the [[Falathrim]], "''people of the foaming shore''", and dwelt in the [[Falas]] by the sea. There they built many ships, and the mighty [[Havens of the Falas]], and found pearls which they sent to their king, [[Thingol]] of [[Doriath]], who was known as Elwë.<ref name="Sindar">{{S|Sindar}}</ref>

When [[Morgoth]] broke forth in the [[First Battle]] in {{YT|1497}}, Círdan was cut off and unable to come to Thingol's aid. Further, although Thingol prevailed with the help of the [[Laiquendi]], the Green-elves of [[Ossiriand]], the Falathrim were driven to the very edge of the sea, where they were besieged for some months, until the [[Return of the Noldor]] from Aman, when [[Fëanor]] struck at [[Morgoth]] from the north. The siege of the Falas was abandoned as the [[Orcs]] were ordered northward to help their master, where they were all destroyed by [[Celegorm]] and his forces, and the Falas was saved.<ref name="Sindar" /><ref name="return">{{S|Return}}</ref>

=====Wars of the Noldor=====
Círdan attended the [[Mereth Aderthad]] with many of his people, where he swore oaths of friendship with the Noldor.<ref name="return" /> Between Círdan and [[Finrod Felagund]], [[King of Nargothrond]], there was friendship and alliance, and with the aid of the [[Noldor]] the havens of [[Brithombar]] and [[Eglarest]] were built anew.<ref name="Belerian">{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

When the tales began spreading (sown by [[Morgoth]]) of the [[Kinslaying of Alqualondë]], Círdan, being very wise even at that time, was greatly troubled, feeling that these rumors sprouted from great malice. Knowing the jealousy and dissention among the Noldor, he guessed that the malice was that of the kinslayers. Therefore he dutifully sent messages to his overlord Thingol, telling him all that he had heard. This resulted in Thingol banning the speaking of [[Quenya]] and greater strife between the Sindar and the Noldor.<ref>{{S|Noldor}}</ref>

Círdan made up for his lack of participation in the [[Wars of Beleriand|wars of the Noldor]] with his role in the [[Second Assault on Hithlum]], coming to the timely aid of [[Fingon]] when he was most needed. The ships of Círdan sailed up the [[Firth of Drengist]] in great stength and then struck the unsuspecting [[Orcs]] from the west, giving victory to the Elves.<ref name="Fingolfin">{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

Many years later, in {{FA|472}}, after the disastrous [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], many fugitives came for shelter in Círdan's havens. The Falathrim mariners harassed the orcs in guerilla attacks from the sea. But it was only a matter of time before [[Morgoth]] attacked. Then came the disastrous [[Fall of the Falas]]. Though both [[Brithombar]] and [[Eglarest]] were strong, with mighty walls, both fell one at a time due to the impressive array of siege-masters Morgoth had in his train. Although Círdan's people fought valiantly, the walls were broken and most of the Falathrim killed or enslaved. [[Barad Nimras]] was cast down, and the Falas laid to waste. But Círdan and some of his followers escaped by sea, and he took with him the young [[Gil-galad]], one of the last of the princes of the Noldor. They came to the [[Isle of Balar]] and founded a new refuge, but kept a foothold at the [[Mouths of Sirion]], keeping ships hidden in the reeds there.<ref name="Fifth">{{S|Fifth}}</ref>

====Refuge in Balar====
[[Turgon]], the King of [[Gondolin]], receiving the dreadful news, requested that Círdan send mariners to seek [[Valinor]] and the aid of the [[Valar]]. Círdan built seven swift ships, and sent them westward. None returned, save for only [[Voronwë|one mariner]] of the [[Gondolindrim]] who was also his kinsman.<ref name="Tuor">{{UT|1}}</ref> The way to the West was closed.<ref name="Fifth" />

Eventually Círdan served as messenger, when [[Ulmo]] delivered him a message for [[Orodreth]], the King of [[Nargothrond]], warning of the doom of Nargothrond, and ordering him to shut his gates and cast down the bridge. The warning went unheeded, resulting in the [[Fall of Nargothrond]] in {{FA|495}}.{{fact}}

After news came to Balar of the [[Fall of Gondolin]], [[Gil-galad]] was proclaimed [[High King of the Noldor]]. Círdan soon after became a fast friend of the young half-elf [[Eärendil]] son of [[Tuor]] and [[Idril]], who had grown up essentially under his shadow, and was apprenticed to him. Círdan aided Eärendil in building the ship [[Vingilot]], giving him advice and help. Círdan doubtless remembered his vision, and this ship was indeed a fulfillment of it.<ref name="Cirdan" />

Círdan and Gil-galad came with their ships from Balar too late to prevent the disastrous [[Third Kinslaying]], when the [[Mouths of Sirion|Havens of Sirion]] were ambushed and many fell. But Eärendil was not there, rather on a voyage, and the [[Silmaril]] of [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] had been spirited away by [[Elwing]] his wife. Thus, wielding the Silmaril, Eärendil came to [[Valinor]] and found the forgiveness of the [[Valar]].<ref name="Earendil">{{S|Earendil}}</ref> From that time on, Círdan was given foresight surpassing that of any of the Elves,<ref name="Cirdan" /> perhaps some special grace of the Valar for his deeds in this world-changing episode (like the return of [[Glorfindel]], who also contributed significantly).{{fact}}

After the [[War of Wrath]], Círdan, heeding the bidding of the Valar long ago, once more obediently abstained from finding his heart's desire and going West, but with a small following remained in [[Middle-earth]].

===Second Age===
The continents were shifted, but Círdan still took up his abode by the sea, at the [[Grey Havens]], which the Elves built in the newly-formed [[Gulf of Lune]] whence the [[Eldar]] could sail the [[Straight Road]], but most of them were unwilling at first to forsake the lands they fought in and preferred to linger there.<ref name="rings">{{S|Rings}}</ref>

At the very beginning of the [[Second Age]], Círdan was instrumental in devising and overseeing the construction of the boats that were used to transport the remnants of the [[Edain]] to their new land, which would later become the realm of [[Númenor]].<ref name="Edain">{{NM|P3xiii}}, p. 339</ref>

Círdan personally elected the Elven captains and helmsmen who were in charge of transporting the Edain to Númenor, and since those boats were small, it took a great number of such boats to transfer all of the Edain and their possessions - a process that took at least 50 years, and which only ended when the Valar instructed Círdan to cease any future migration of Men to the island.<ref name="Edain" />

Many centuries later, in {{SA|600}}, Círdan welcomed the friendly and then-unfallen [[Númenóreans]], making friends with [[Vëantur]], chief of the mariners of [[Tar-Elendil]], and later teaching [[Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion]] his grandson of ships (both management and construction) and seaside architecture,<ref name="Wife">{{UT|Wife}}</ref> doubtless being the foremost authority on both.{{fact}}

Círdan advised against the creation of the [[Rings of Power]] when [[Sauron|Annatar]] came, but, like Galadriel, his counsel went unheeded in the midst of the ambition of the [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain]]. Nevertheless, when the [[Three Rings]]  were hidden, Celebrimbor had appointed him to inherit one of them and so, Círdan received [[Narya]], the Ring of Fire.<ref name="rings" /> [[Sauron]], having revealed himself in the [[Sack of Eregion|destruction of Eregion]] and empowered by [[the One Ring]] he had forged, [[sack of Eregion|invaded]] [[Eriador]] in the same blow; however, he dared not attempt to take Círdan's [[Mithlond]] or [[Lindon]], fearing they were too strong because they had the help of the [[Númenóreans]].<ref name="rings" />

Círdan joined the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]], and fought alongside [[Gil-galad]]. Many fell there, including [[Gil-galad]] and [[Elendil]]. After the battle, with Elrond, he urged [[Isildur]], Elendil's heir, to throw the captured One Ring into [[Orodruin]], where it would be unmade, but Isildur refused.<ref name="rings" /><ref name="Council">{{FR|Council}}</ref> 

===Third Age===
{{blockquote|Take this ring, Master… for your labours will be heavy; but it will support you in the weariness that you have taken upon yourself. For this is the Ring of Fire, and with it you may rekindle hearts in a world that grows chill. But as for me, my heart is with the [[Belegaer|Sea]], and I will dwell by the grey shores until the [[Last Ship|last ship]] sails. I will await you.| Círdan to Gandalf, ''[[Appendix B]]''}}

[[File:Alystraea - Cirdan.jpg|250px|thumb|right|''Cirdan'' by [[:Category:Images by Alystraea|Alystraea]]]]
After the [[War of the Last Alliance]] and the death of Gil-galad, Círdan remained the Lord of the Havens.<ref name="rings" /> For more than a thousand years they went undisturbed,<ref name="AppB2">{{App|B2}}</ref> but at around {{TA|1050}}, a shadow began to lengthen. It was at this time the [[Istari]], sent by the [[Valar]], came. Círdan was the most foresighted of all Elves in Middle-earth, and he alone knew the true purpose of the Istari.<ref name="AppB2" /> He also saw deep into the future of Gandalf, and gave him [[Narya]], his greatest possession and one of the most secret and sought-after treasures in the world.<ref name="rings" />

Throughout the [[Angmar War]], the Elves of Lindon under Círdan supported [[Arnor]]. They assisted King [[Arveleg I|Arveleg]] and the men of [[Cardolan]] drive off the [[Hill-men]] from the [[Weather Hills]]. Later, with Círdan’s help, Arveleg's young son, [[Araphor]], drove [[Angmar]]'s armies from [[Fornost]] and the [[North Downs]]. Combining forces with [[Rivendell]], and the [[Galadhrim]] who joined them from beyond the [[Misty Mountains]], they subdued Angmar for some time.<ref name="eriador">{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

In {{TA|1975}}, Círdan sent Elven sailors from Lindon on a ship to [[Forochel]] to rescue the lost king [[Arvedui]]. The crew endured a perilous journey, but Arvedui rashly attempted to return that winter, and all aboard perished. The next year, Círdan and the Elves of Lindon [[Host of the West (Arnor)|joined]] with the remnants of [[Arnor]] in the victorious [[Battle of Fornost]].<ref name="eriador" /><ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref> Later, Círdan took control of the abandoned [[palantíri|Elendil Stone]] on [[Emyn Beraid]], which could gaze into the [[Tol Eressëa|lost west]] and was without link to the other ''[[palantíri]]''.<ref name="Palantiri">{{UT|Palantiri}}</ref>
[[File:Peter Pracownik - Ten of Cups (LOTR).jpg|thumb|135px|right|Círdan remains in Middle-earth - Art by [[Peter Pracownik]]]]
Nothing more is mentioned of his actions until the [[War of the Ring]] in {{TA|3018}} and later in {{TA|3021|n}}. [[Galdor of the Havens|Galdor]] was his messenger to [[Rivendell]] and attended the [[Council of Elrond]], speaking with authority on his lord's behalf.<ref name="Council" />

The last mention of Círdan came with the end of the Third Age. When the Ringbearers came to Mithlond, Círdan greeted them before the gates. Although [[Gandalf]], [[Galadriel]], and [[Elrond]] passed west on the [[White Ship|ship]] he had built for them, Círdan seems to have remained for a time.{{fact}}

===Later history===
{{Main|Last Ship}}
Círdan maintained the haven at least into the early [[Fourth Age]], but it was recognized that eventually, its purpose would reach an end when no more Eldar wished to cross the [[Sea]]. At that time, Círdan would abandon the Grey Havens and finally travel the [[Straight Road]] himself.<ref name="eriador" /> On some unknown date, he sailed west aboard the [[Last Ship]] with his kinsman [[Celeborn]], but when he did so, he took with him the last living memory of the [[Elder Days]] in [[Middle-earth]].<ref name="prologue" />

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Cirdan.mp3|Ardamir}}
''Círdan'' is a [[Sindarin]] name. It means "Shipbuilder"<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 27</ref><ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries '''KIR-''' and '''TAN-'''</ref> or "Shipwright".<ref>{{PM|Last}}, "Círdan", p. 385</ref>

The [[Quenya]] cognate was '''''Ciryatan''''' (pron. {{IPA|[ˈkirʲatan]}}).<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entry "kir-''<nowiki/>''</ref>

==Other names==
Círdan's original name was '''''Nōwē'''''. According to [[Paul Strack]], it was a [[Primitive Elvish]] name, but its meaning is unclear.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2331717483.html|articlename=✶ ''Nōwē'' pn.|website=Eldamo|accessed=10 October 2023}}</ref>

He was also called '''''Cirdan the Shipwright''''',<ref name="Aman">{{AA|70}}, p. 85</ref> as well as '''''Cirdan of Lune'''''<ref name="Lune" /><ref name="Moon" /> (in both instances, without accent over the letter ''i'', though).

==Appearance==
In the last years of the Third Age, Círdan appeared old save for his eyes which "''were keen as stars''"; he also had a long beard.<ref name="Havens">{{RK|Havens}}, p. 1030</ref> Likely, he had grown a beard since having reached his [[Elven life cycle#"Cycles of life" and aging|third cycle of life]].<ref>{{VT|41b}}, p. 9</ref>

==Significance==
[[File:David Greset - Cirdan the Carpenter.jpg|130px|thumb|left|''Cirdan the Carpenter'' by [[:Category:Images by David Greset|David Greset]]]]
Círdan had a profound effect upon the course of Middle-earth history. He was a loyal servant and friend of [[Elwë]], sacrificing his heart's desire in search of him.<ref name="Cirdan" />

This loyalty and sense of duty shows up numerous times over the course of history, including his second sacrifice in his submission to the [[Valar]],<ref name="Cirdan" /> and his sending of troubling and potentially destructive rumors to his overlord Thingol.

He was also the most foresighted of the Elves, a consequence of the gift from the Valar.<ref name="Cirdan" /><ref name="AppB2" /> He conceivably saved Elven civilization with the founding of the havens at the [[Mouths of Sirion]],<ref name="Fifth" /> and with the fostering of both [[Gil-galad]] and [[Eärendil]].<ref name="Earendil" /> His precious gift of [[Narya]] to [[Gandalf]] was also timely and valuable.<ref name="AppB2" /> He was clearly favored by [[Ulmo]], seen by the number of messages passed through him.

==Other versions of the legendarium==
===''The Lord of the Rings'' drafts===
The character of Círdan is a fairly late addition to [[Tolkien]]'s [[legendarium]], with his first appearance in the drafts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (dating to the early [[1940]]s) being in an outline of what would become the eleventh chapter, ''[[The Palantír]]'', of the first book in ''[[The Two Towers]]''.<ref name="Wright">{{WR|1|VI}}, pp. 76-7</ref>

The name ''Círdan'' in this outline was spelled as ''Cirdan'', and in one other instance as ''Kirdan''.<ref name="Wright" />

Nonetheless, in a draft for the chapter ''[[Many Partings]]'', the term ''Círdan'' is used.<ref>{{SD|Partings}}, p. 67</ref>

===''The Etymologies''===
However, Círdan's first appearance in the legendarium as a whole seems to be in ''[[The Etymologies]]'' (dating from the late [[1930]]s), where his name was instead given as ''C(e)irdan'' ("shipbuilder" in [[Noldorin]]), with the ''(e)'' probably indicating a development from the Noldorin word ''[[ceir]]'' ("ship"). The name ''Ceirdan'' was itself changed from an earlier form ''Certhan''.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry '''TAN-''', p. 390</ref>

===Later legendarium===
In a late text called ''[[The Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor]]'' (c. [[1969]]), there appears a passage in which Tolkien briefly considered Círdan as being one of the Noldor,<ref name="Weird">{{NM|P3xxii}}, pp. 387-8</ref> in a text explaining the origin of the name ''[[Belfalas]]'':

{{blockquote|There appears, however, in the beginning of the Second Age, to have been a group of Sindar who went south. They were a remnant, it seems, of the people of Doriath, who harboured still their grudge against the Noldor and left the Grey Havens because these and all the ships there were commanded by '''Círdan (a Noldo)'''.|''[[The Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor]]'', ''"Belfalas"'' <ref name=Weird/>}}

However, [[Carl Hostetter]] later comments, quoting [[Christopher Tolkien]]'s own commentary on the text:

{{blockquote|The manuscript page ends mid-sentence, and without reaching an explanation of the element ''Bel-''. Christopher Tolkien writes: "It was perhaps a purely experimental extension of the history, at once abandoned; but the assertion that Círdan was a Noldo is very strange. This runs clean counter to the entire tradition concerning him — yet it is essential to the idea sketched in this passage. Possibly it was his realization of this that led my father to abandon it in mid-sentence."|''[[The Rivers and Beacon-hills of Gondor]]'', "Commentary on the text ''Belfalas''" <ref name=Weird/>}}

At no other point in the legendarium was Círdan ever considered a Noldo.
