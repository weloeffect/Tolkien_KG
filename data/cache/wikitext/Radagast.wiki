'''Radagast the Brown''', also known as '''Hrávandil''' and '''Aiwendil''', was a [[Maia]] who was sent  to [[Middle-earth]] as
one of the [[Five Guardians|Guardians]] to protect the [[Elves]] against [[Morgoth]] at the beginning of the [[First Age]] and later as one of the [[Wizards]] to contest the will of [[Sauron]] in the [[Third Age]]. Chosen for his later mission by the Valië [[Yavanna]], he had a strong affinity for animals. Radagast dwelt, for a time, at [[Rhosgobel]] on the western eaves of [[Mirkwood]], near the [[Gladden Fields]] and the [[Anduin|Great River]] in the Third Age.

==History==
[[File:Jef Murray - Mage of Rhosgobel.jpg|thumb|left|''Mage of Rhosgobel'' by [[Jef Murray]]]]
The [[Maia]] Aiwendil was an [[Ainu]] who existed before [[Time]], and one of the [[spirits]] who descended to [[Arda]] in order to serve the [[Valar]].<ref>{{S|Vala}}</ref> Aiwendil was associated with the Valië [[Yavanna]], the Queen of earth.<ref name="IstariTables">{{UT|Istari}}, tables relating the Istari to the Valar</ref>

In the beginning of the [[First Age]], after the Vala [[Oromë]] discovered the primeval [[Elves]] at [[Cuiviénen]], Aiwendil was sent by the Valar as one of five other great spirits of the Maiar as a [[Five Guardians|Guardian]] to Cuiviénen to protect the Elves from the forces of [[Melkor]]. He was known there by the name ''Hrávandil''. It is unclear in which shape he came there, how long he remained or if he accompanied the [[Eldar]] on the [[Great Journey]].<ref>{{NM|Dates}}, TEXT 1, p. 95</ref>

After the defeat of [[Morgoth]], the Valar grew concerned about the growing power of [[Sauron]] in [[Middle-earth]]. Manwë summoned a council of the [[Valar]], and it was decided that they would send Maiar as emissaries to Middle-earth to aid the [[Free Peoples]]. [[Aulë]] chose [[Saruman|Curumo]] and Manwë chose [[Gandalf|Olórin]]. Yavanna subsequently begged Curumo to take Aiwendil with him,<ref>{{UT|Istari}}, narrative of a council of the Valar</ref> Curumo was obliged to do so to please Yavanna.<ref>{{UT|Istari}}, page of jottings belonging to the same period</ref> The Valar forbade them to match Sauron's power with power or to use force or fear to dominate the Elves and [[Men]]<ref>{{App|TA}}, introduction to the Tale of Years of the Third Age, p. 1085</ref>, such as to reveal themselves in majestic forms or open displays of power<ref name="UTIstari" />. Instead, they were asked to advise and persuade Elves and Men and were sent in weak and humble real bodies that resembled old [[Men]]. As a consequence, they could experience fear, pain, weariness, hunger, thirst and could be killed. However, due to their spirits they aged only slowly.<ref name="UTIstari" />

In c. {{TA|1000}}, Aiwendil who was clothed in earthen brown, Curumo, and Olórin arrived upon the shores of Middle-earth, having the form of old [[Men]], whom the peoples called [[Wizards]].<ref name="UTIstari"/>

===Travels in Middle-earth===
When the Wizards took their mission they roamed Middle-earth, but Radagast was never much of a traveller.<ref name="CouncilP256">{{FR|Council}}, p. 256</ref> There is not much to be told about his early journeys, but by the late [[Third Age]] he eventually settled down and dwelt, for a time at least, at [[Rhosgobel]] near the borders of [[Mirkwood]]<ref name="CouncilP256"/> near its southern end,<ref name="Queer">{{H|Queer}}</ref> probably on its western side south of the [[Gladden Fields]] and opposite of the [[East Bight]]<ref>{{TI|MII}}, in the middle of map square L13, p. 305</ref>. He received his name Radagast from the [[Men of the Vales of Anduin]].<ref name="IstariNote4">{{UT|Istari}}, note 4</ref> Living on the western borders of Mirkwood, it can be assumed that the Wizard held watch against the [[Shadow]] of [[Dol Guldur]] that slowly engulfed the forest. It is likely that he became acquainted with the inhabitants of that region. He was friends with animals, especially birds, including the [[eagles|Great Eagles]].<ref>{{FR|Council}}, pp. 257 and 261</ref> Although the neighboring [[Beorn]] was unsociable, he used to see him from time to time, and he considered Radagast "not a bad fellow" for a Wizard.<ref name="Queer" />

In {{TA|2851}}, the [[White Council]] met once more and, after that, Saruman began to search near the [[Gladden Fields]] for the [[One Ring]].<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2851, p. 1088</ref> Radagast decided to aid his search with birds and beasts who acted as spies hoping that Saruman's actions would help watch and hinder Sauron. Radagast did this in good faith, knowing nothing of Saruman's real ambitions to keep the Ring for himself.<ref name="SRings">{{S|Rings}}</ref>

[[File:Angelo Montanini - Radagast.jpg|thumb|''Radagast'' by [[Angelo Montanini]]]]
By the time of the [[War of the Ring]] Radagast did not dwell any more in Rhosgobel. In summer {{TA|3018}} Saruman told Radagast that he was willing to help Gandalf, and sent the Brown Wizard to seek him out at once. Radagast did not know much of [[Eriador]] but sought for [[the Shire]], knowing that he would find Gandalf nearby.<ref name="FRCouncil">{{FR|Council}}, pp. 256-7</ref>

Indeed, on [[Mid-year's Day|Midsummer's Day]],<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3018, June Mid-year's Day, p. 1091</ref> Radagast was sitting on the side of the [[Greenway]] with his horse near [[Bree]] when Gandalf found him on his way to the village. Radagast warned Gandalf that the [[Nazgûl]] were abroad, disguised as riders in black, and that they were seeking news of [[the Shire]]. He also gave him Saruman's invitation and agreed to help Gandalf by getting beasts and birds to send news to [[Orthanc]]. With that he rode away back towards Mirkwood.<ref name="FRCouncil"/>

By sending Gandalf to Orthanc, Radagast unwittingly had him captured. Saruman's message proved to be a trap for Gandalf who was imprisoned in Orthanc, but still he did not believe that Radagast was also a part of Saruman's plans. Indeed, it was thanks to Radagast that Gandalf was able to escape from the pinnacle of Orthanc upon the wings of [[Gwaihir]].<ref>{{FR|Council}}, pp. 257-61</ref>

Radagast's actions during and after the rest of the War are not recorded. After the [[Council of Elrond]], many scouts were sent out from [[Rivendell]] to many different locations. Some passed over the [[Misty Mountains]] and eventually came to [[Rhosgobel]], but they found that Radagast was not there.<ref name="FRSouth">{{FR|South}}, p. 274</ref>

==Characteristics==
Radagast was associated with the [[Valar|Vala]] [[Yavanna]],<ref name="IstariTables">{{UT|Istari}}, tables relating the Istari to the Valar</ref> who loved plants<ref>{{S|IIb}}</ref> and had planted the seeds for plants in [[Arda]]<ref>{{S|Days}}</ref>. He was perhaps a member of the "people" of Yavanna.<ref name="IstariTables" />

Radagast had much less power and wisdom than [[Saruman]] or [[Gandalf]].<ref>{{UT|Istari}}, note about the Istari from 1972</ref> Gandalf esteemed him as "a worthy Wizard"<ref name="CouncilP257">{{FR|Council}}, p. 257</ref>, but Saruman scorningly gave him the bynames "'''the Bird-tamer'''", "'''the Simple'''" and "'''the Fool'''"<ref name="CouncilP258">{{FR|Council}}, p. 258</ref>.

Radagast was "a master of shapes and changes of hue".<ref name="CouncilP257" /> He fell in love with the beasts and birds of Middle-earth<ref>{{UT|Istari}}, essay on the Istari</ref> and knew much about herbs and animals<ref name="CouncilP257" />. Beasts and birds were his friends.<ref name="CouncilP257" /> Gandalf, however, held greater knowledge of birds and beasts than Radagast, as well as greater respect and affection received from them. Radagast found beasts and birds easier to deal with and interacted very little with [[Elves]] or [[Men]].<ref>{{NM|Descriptions}}, Gandalf, p. 193</ref><ref name="RC.245">{{HM|RC}}, p. 245</ref>

Radagast only had short, curling, light brown hair on his chin (instead of a full beard) when he appeared in the body of a man in the [[Third Age]].<ref name="Beards" />

==Etymology==
In a very late note written by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] in [[1972]] the name is said to be derived from the [[Men of the Vales of Anduin]] and that its meaning is "not now clearly interpretable".<ref name="IstariNote4" />

In a manuscript written by Tolkien in [[1954]], the name ''Radagast'' is said to be "in the tongue of Númenor of old" and to mean "tender of beasts".<ref name="UTIstari"/> [[John D. Rateliff]] suggests that it is possible that Tolkien did not mean classical [[Adûnaic]], but [[Westron]], which was descended from Adûnaic.<ref name=HHO>{{HM|HHO}}, pp. 278, 291</ref>

John D. Rateliff and [[Douglas A. Anderson]] suggest the name of the [[Gothic]] chieftain ''[[Wikipedia:Radagaisus|Radagaisus]]'', whose name (as noted by [[David Salo]]) is rendered ''Rhadagast'' in some works from the 18th and 19th century (e.g., ''King Alfred's Anglo-Saxon Version of Boethius' De Consolatione Philosophiae'', translated by J.S. Cardale in 1829) as a source of inspiration. They also suggest the name of the Slavic god [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radegast_%28god%29 ''Radegast''] (mentioned by the eleventh-century german historian Adam of Bremen's Gesta Hamburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum and nineteenth-century german writer Jacob Grimm in Teutonic Mythology) or ''Redigast''.<ref name=HHO/><ref>{{HM|AH}}, p. 167</ref><ref name=RC>{{HM|RC}}, pp. 240-241</ref> John D. Rateliff also suggests that it may be an [[Old English]] name, which means "Spirit of the Road" and consistings of the components ''rad'' ("road") and ''gast'' ("spirit", "angel", "human being"). John D. Rateliff suggests that the name of the Gothic king is the most convincing source of inspiration, because of J.R.R. Tolkien's interest in the Gothic language and his knowledge of Gothic history.<ref name=HHO/> [[Tom Shippey]] mentions that Edward Gibbon's ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'' stayed in Tolkien's mind and that ''Radagaisus'' is included in its index.<ref>[[Tom Shippey]], ''The Road to Middle-earth'', Appendix A Tolkien's Sources: The True Tradition, 3rd edition, p. 396</ref>

Mark Fisher suggests the old [[Old English]] name ''rudugást'' ("red-brown spirit") from ''rudu'' ("red" or "red brown")<ref>{{webcite|author=Joseph Bosworth|articleurl=https://bosworthtoller.com/26011|articlename=rudu|website=Bowsworth Toller's Anglo-Saxon Dictionary online|accessed=09 December 2024}}</ref> and ''gást'' ("spirit")<ref>{{webcite|author=Joseph Bosworth|articleurl=https://bosworthtoller.com/13319|articlename=GÁST|website=Bowsworth Toller's Anglo-Saxon Dictionary online|accessed=09 December 2024}}</ref> as a source for the name Radgast.<ref>{{webcite|author=Mark Fisher|articleurl=https://www.glyphweb.com/arda/r/radagast.php|articlename=Radagast|website=The Encyclopedia of Arda|accessed=09 December 2024}}</ref>

[[Jason Fisher]] suggests the [[Old Norse]] word ''ráðgast'' ("to take counsel") as a source for the name Radagast.<ref>{{webcite|author=Jason Fisher|articleurl=http://lingwe.blogspot.com/2007/12/thinking-about-radagast.html|articlename=Thinking about Radagast|website=Lingwë|accessed=09 December 2024}}</ref>

==Other names==
{{Pronounce|Quenya - Aiwendil.mp3|Gilgamesh}}
The name ''Aiwendil'' is [[Quenya]] for "Lover of Birds".<ref>{{UT|13a}}, note 6</ref> It is obviously derived from ''[[aiwë]]'' ("a small bird") + ''[[-ndil]]'' ("devoted to").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 241</ref>

Another Quenya name was ''Hrávandil'', used when he was sent to [[Cuiviénen]] with the other [[Five Guardians|Guardians]], which according to [[Carl Hostetter]] most likely means "Wild beast friend", from ''hravan'' ("wild beast") and ''-ndil'' ("friend").<ref>{{NM|Dates}}, Notes, note 7, p. 102</ref>

As one of the [[Wizards]] sent to [[Middle-earth]], he was known as "Radagast '''the Brown'''".<ref name="CouncilP256" /><ref name="CouncilP258" /> It is possible that he received this byname, because of the earthen brown colour of the clothes that he wore when he arrived in Middle-earth in c. {{TA|1000}}. The bynames of Saruman and Gandalf, "the White"<ref>{{FR|Shadow}}, p. 48</ref><ref name="CouncilP258" /> and "the Grey"<ref>{{FR|Council}}, p. 254</ref>, respectively,<ref name="CouncilP258" /> matched the colour of their clothes and the other two Wizards who wore sea-blue clothes were called "the Blue Wizards"<ref name="UTIstari"/>.

[[Saruman]], when talking to [[Gandalf]], mocked Radagast by calling him "Radagast the Bird-tamer", "Radagast the Simple", and "Radagast the Fool".<ref name="CouncilP258" />

==Other versions of the legendarium==
From the first drafts of ''The Hobbit'', [[Gandalf|Bladorthin]] identifies Radagast as a fellow wizard and as his "cousin". [[John D. Rateliff]] notes that, at this stage in the development of [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien's]] [[legendarium]] there was no reason why a wizard could not have a cousin. Rateliff also suggests that it is likely that Tolkien considered explaining Gandalf's absence (following the departure of Thorin and Company from Beorn's house) by saying that he went to visit Radagast (who lived close by) to plan the attack on the [[Sauron|Necromancer]].<ref name="HHMedwed">{{HH|Medwed}}, "(vi) Radagast"</ref>

Early in the process of writing ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', it is clear that [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] envisaged some role for Radagast in the tale.<ref>{{RS|New}}, p. 379;{{RS|Elrond}}, p. 397</ref> He eventually decided that he would use Radagast as the means of getting Gandalf to Isengard.<ref name="TIC1.130-140">{{TI|C1}}, pp. 130-140</ref>

Initially Gandalf describes Radagast as his "cousin",<ref>{{TI|C1}}, p. 131</ref> as he did in ''[[The Hobbit]]'',<ref name="Queer" /> but in a subsequent draft he becomes his "kinsman".<ref>{{TI|C2}}, p. 149</ref> In the final version Gandalf merely says that Radagast is "one of my order".<ref name="FRCouncil"/>

Tolkien initially called him "Radagast '''the Grey'''", but in pencil he changed this to "Brown" and subsequently Saruman refers to him as "Radagast the Brown".<ref name="TIC1.130-140"/>

When Tolkien finished writing the story up till Moria, he made notes on the future story development; therein he considered Gandalf evicting Saruman from Isengard and handing it over to Radagast after the fall of Mordor.<ref>{{TI|Story}}, p. 212</ref>

===Films===
'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:Radagast is entirely omitted. Without Radagast's involvement, [[Gandalf]] goes to [[Isengard]] of his own accord (because he wanted counsel from [[Saruman]]) and is able to escape from the pinnacle of [[Orthanc]] by speaking to a moth who sends for the help of the [[Eagles]].

'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''
:Although Radagast is only briefly mentioned in ''The Hobbit'', Radagast features in ''The Hobbit'' films and is played by [[Sylvester McCoy]].<ref name="IMCasting">{{webcite|author=[[Ian McKellen]]|articleurl=http://www.mckellen.com/cinema/hobbit-movie/110510.htm|articlename=2 Elves and another wizard|dated=10-May-2011|website=[http://www.mckellen.com/ Ian McKellen's website]|accessed=23-Dec-2011}}</ref> He is highly eccentric and somewhat absent-minded, and also uses a sled pulled by several large [[rabbits]] (which he refers to as '[[Rhosgobel]] Rabbits') as his main means of transportation.

:After discovering that a shadow has fallen on [[Mirkwood|Greenwood the Great]] (having had to heal his hedgehog friend [[Sebastian]] because of its power), Radagast enters [[Dol Guldur]] and is attacked by the [[Witch-king]]. He finds that the fortress is occupied by a [[Sauron#Sauron's Return|Necromancer]] and travels to inform Gandalf. He finds [[Thorin and Company]] just west of [[Rivendell]] and hands Gandalf a [[Morgul-knife|morgul blade]]. He draws a pack of [[Wargs]] and their [[Orcs|Orc]] riders away on his rabbit-pulled sled so that Thorin and Company can flee in safety.

'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''
:Radagast briefly appears, investigating the [[High Fells of Rhudaur|High Fells]] with Gandalf, and accompanying him to Dol Guldur. Gandalf then dispatches him to send news of what they've found to [[Galadriel]], while Gandalf enters the fortress ruins alone.

'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''
:Radagast first appears when he comes in Dol Guldur during the [[Attack on Dol Guldur|attack]] by the [[White Council]] to take the weakened Gandalf to safety. After they escape, Gandalf requests a horse, takes Radagast's staff and also commands him to summon 'bird and beast' for the impending [[Battle of Five Armies|battle]]. He arrives with the Eagles late in the battle along with [[Beorn]]. They demolish the Orc forces and effectively help end the Battle of Five Armies.

===Radio series===
'''1981: ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|BBC Radio's The Lord of the Ring]]'':'''
:[[Donald Gee]] provided the voice of Radagast. He is introduced much earlier than in the book because his meeting with Gandalf is given chronologically.

'''2001: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of Radagast the Brown is provided by Vlado Černý. He appears briefly in a flashback scene, when Gandalf is recounting his meeting with Radagast, and his subsequent visit to Saruman, imprisonment and eventual escape from Orthanc.
