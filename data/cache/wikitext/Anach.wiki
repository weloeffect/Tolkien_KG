The '''Pass of Anach''' (from ''[[an]]'' = "long") was a long and narrow pass that ran down out of the highlands of [[Dorthonion]], cutting south-west between the near-impassable mountains of the [[Crissaegrim]] and [[Ered Gorgoroth]]. Towards its southern end, where it opened into the land of [[Dimbar]], were the springs of the River [[Mindeb]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>

In the later years of the [[First Age]], Dorthonion fell under [[Morgoth]]'s control, and with it the Pass of Anach. His [[Orcs]] began to use it as a way down from the highlands, building a road through the valley to reach and harass the lands beyond.<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref> Ultimately they succeeded in conquering not only [[Dimbar]], but also the regions to the east that ran along the borders of [[Doriath]].
