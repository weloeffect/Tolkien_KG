==First stanza==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
:Grim was the world and grey last night;
::The moon and stars were fled,
:The hall was dark without song or light.
::The fires were fallen dead.
:The wind in the trees was like to the sea,
::And over the mountains' teeth
:It whistled bitter-cold and free,
::As a sword leapt from its sheath.<ref name=collectedpoems/></poem>

''Noel'' was published together with the poem ''[[Shadow-Bride|The Shadow Man]]'' in the [[Annual of Our Lady's School (1936)|''Annual'' of Our Lady's School]] in [[1936]]. According to [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]], who discovered the poem in [[2013]], it is a "directly [[Christianity|Christian]] poem, celebrating the birth of [[Christ]]".<ref name=name/>

In [[2024]], the poem was re-published in September as entry 148 of ''[[The Collected Poems of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', where Hammond and Scull likened the poem's mood to "an English winter" and compared it to Christina Rossetti's 'A Christmas Carol' from 1872.<ref name="collectedpoems">{{CP|148}}</ref>
