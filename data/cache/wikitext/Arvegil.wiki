'''Arvegil''' ({{TA|1553}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 194</ref> - {{TA|1743|n}},<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 190) was the eleventh king of [[Arthedain]], succeeding his father, [[Argeleb II]], upon his death in 1670.
==History==
During his father's reign, Arvegil saw events that would shape the history of [[Middle-earth]], including the foundation of [[the Shire]]. He was eighty-three years old (no great age for one of the [[Dúnedain]]) when the [[Great Plague]] came out of the south and ravaged [[Eriador]], but the seat of the Kings at [[Fornost]] in the north was little affected.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

Arvegil lived for one hundred and ninety years, longer than any of his descendants until [[Aragorn]].<ref>{{PM|Ai}}</ref> By the standards of his own ancestors, though, this was an early death. Of all the northern Kings before Arvegil - excepting those slain in battle - only two had lived less than two hundred years: his father [[Argeleb II]] and his grandfather [[Araphor]].

Arvegil ruled [[Arthedain]] for seventy-three years, and was succeeded by his son, who ruled as [[Arveleg II]], upon his death in {{TA|1743|n}}.<ref name="North"/>

== Etymology ==
''Arvegil'' is a [[Sindarin]] name. Its meaning its not glossed, but the Association Tolkiendil suggests that ''Arvegil'' means "Royal Sword" and is a combination of ''[[ara|ar(a)-]]'' ("royal", "noble", "high") and a [[lenition|lenited]] form ''vegil'' of ''megil'' ("sword").<ref>{{webcite|author=Association Tolkiendil|articleurl=https://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/compound_sindarin_names|articlename=Compound Sindarin Names in Middle-earth|website=Tolkiendil|accessed=03 February 2022}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In post-1966 revisions of [[Appendix A]], Aragorn's year of death is amended from Fo.A. 100 to {{FoA|120}}, making him 210 years old (which age is explicitly confirmed in post-1993 printings). The reference to him being the longest-lived of his line since Arvegil is not changed, even though with this change in the chronology, Aragorn would be older than Arvegil.
