== Musical Characteristics ==
Summoning is known for their epic-style, Tolkien-related atmospheric black metal style, with emphasis on keyboards.  Their trademark sound is characterized by:
* Very minimalistic guitars often low in the mix
*  Programmed and heavily reverberated drums giving a very cavernous feel to the rhythm
* Multi-layered synthesizer and keyboard melodies mimicking orchestral instruments which often dominates the rest of the mix.
* Vocals performed in a traditional black metal fashion, however they are often heavily reverberated, giving a very epic and roomy sound to the songs.
* The band often makes use of audio samples, particularly from the ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' radio play.
