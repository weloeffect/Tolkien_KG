'''Gerontius Took''' ({{SR|1190}} - {{SR|1320|n}}, died aged 130), also known as '''The Old Took''', was a renowned [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] and twenty-sixth [[Thain]] of [[the Shire]].

==History==
Gerontius was the only son of [[Fortinbras Took I|Fortinbras I]]. He married [[Adamanta Chubb]], who gave birth to twelve children: [[Isengrim Took III|Isengrim III]], [[Hildigard Took|Hildigard]], [[Isumbras Took IV|Isumbras IV]], [[Hildigrim Took|Hildigrim]], [[Isembold Took|Isembold]], [[Hildifons Took|Hildifons]], [[Isembard Took|Isembard]], [[Hildibrand Took|Hildibrand]], [[Belladonna Took|Belladonna]], [[Donnamira Took|Donnamira]], [[Mirabella Took|Mirabella]] and [[Isengar Took|Isengar]].

After the death of his father in {{SR|1248|n}}, Gerontius became the twenty-sixth [[Thain]] of [[the Shire]].<ref>{{App|Took}}</ref> He was a friend of [[Gandalf]], who gave him a pair of magic diamond studs<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref> and performed firework tricks during Gerontius' [[Mid-year's Day|midsummer]]-eve parties.<ref>{{H|6}}</ref><ref group="note">Midsummer-eve obviously refers to 1 [[Lithe]].</ref>

Gerontius Took reached the impressive age of 130, which made him the oldest [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] until his grandson [[Bilbo Baggins]] celebrated his 131st Birthday.<ref>{{RK|Havens}}</ref> He also held the record of most offspring, until [[Samwise Gamgee]] bested him with [[Tolman Gardner|Tom]]'s birth in {{SR|1442}}.<ref>{{App|Gamgee}}</ref>

==Etymology==
He was called ''The Old Took'' not because of his age, but because of his numerous younger relatives.<ref name="RC">{{HM|RC}}, p. 54</ref>

''[[Wikipedia:Gerontius|Gerontius]]'' is a Latin name, which means "Old-man". It is derived from Greek ''Geróntios''. The element ''géron'' is Greek for "old". ''Gerontius'' was a popular name in the Late Roman Empire and is rendered as ''[[Wikipedia:Geraint|Geraint]]'' in [[Welsh]].<ref>{{HM|IE}}, The Giving of Names, p. 191</ref> ''Geraint'' is found as a royal name in ''The [[Wikipedia:Mabinogion|Mabinogion]]'' and in Tennyson's ''[[Wikipedia:Geraint and Enid#Geraint and Enid|Geraint and Enid]]''.<ref>[[Mark T. Hooker]], [[Tolkien and Welsh]], p. 133</ref>

''Gerontius'' is one of the very few Greco-Latin names appearing in Hobbit lore.

==Inspiration==
In [[Letter to Mr and Mrs Kloos|a letter to Mr. and Mrs. Kloos]], Tolkien stated that when he wrote ''[[The Hobbit]]'', he had imagined Bilbo's grandfather to be old, because both of his grandparents were around a hundred years old when they died.<ref name="RC"/>
