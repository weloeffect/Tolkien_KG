'''Bagshot Row''' was the row of [[Hobbit-holes]] that were delved into [[Hobbiton Hill]] beneath [[Bag End]]. The [[Gamgee Family]] lived at Number 3, Bagshot Row.<ref>{{FR|I1}}</ref> Their neighbour was [[Daddy Twofoot]].<ref group=note>It is not mentioned whether he lived at Number 2 or Number 4.</ref> The dwellings had gardens and earthwalls made of the earth removed during the excavation of Bag End.<ref name=nom/>

During the [[War of the Ring]] and the occupation of [[the Shire]], [[Saruman]] had it torn up, and it had become a yawning sand and gravel pit.  After the [[Battle of Bywater]] the destruction was replaced by a new row called, simply, [[New Row]] (in the town of [[Bywater]] it became a joke to refer to it as Sharkey's End).<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>
==Etymology==
It was so named because the earth removed in excavating Bag End was ''shot'' over the edge of the sudden fall in the hillside onto the ground.<ref name=nom>{{HM|N}}, p. 765</ref>
==Portrayal in adaptations==
