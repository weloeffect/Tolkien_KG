The '''House of Fingolfin''' were the descendants and followers of [[Fingolfin]], second son of [[Finwë]]. They held the [[High King of the Noldor|High Kingship of the Noldor]] during the late [[First Age]].

==History==
Fingolfin was accounted [[High King of the Noldor]] after [[Maedhros]] bestowed the Kingship to him, in gratitude for his son [[Fingon]] rescuing him from [[Thangorodrim]] and as compensation for the acts of [[Fëanor|his father]] against him.<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref>

During the early years of the [[Exile of the Noldor]], the House of Fingolfin held the lands to the northwest of [[Beleriand]]: [[Hithlum]], [[Nevrast]] and [[Gondolin]]. Of these, the city of Gondolin held until {{FA|510}}, but Hithlum was overrun by [[Morgoth]] in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], where Fingon was slain (Fingolfin had already met his end in the [[Dagor Bragollach]]).<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref> The remnant of the House, including Fingon's son [[Gil-galad|Ereinion Gil-galad]], were succoured by [[Círdan]] in the [[Grey Havens]].

After the Nirnaeth, [[Tuor]] son of [[Huor]] was sent as a messenger to [[Turgon]] in [[Gondolin]], and there wedded Turgon's daughter [[Idril]]. Thus was the blood of [[Men]] introduced into the House, and the descendants of their line were named half-elven, given the choice of whether they were to considered [[Men]] or [[Elves]].<ref>{{cite DTP|S QS.24.015}}</ref>All these descendants chose to be considered among the [[Firstborn]], except [[Elrond]]'s brother [[Elros]] (who became the first King of [[Númenor]] and was a direct ancestor of [[Aragorn|Aragorn Elessar]]), and Elrond's daughter [[Arwen]] (Queen to Aragorn at the end of the [[Third Age]]).

After the [[Fall of Gondolin]], the survivors of the House lived as exiles at the [[Mouths of Sirion]] or in the [[Falas]], until [[Eärendil]], descendant of Fingolfin's second son Turgon, sailed into the West to seek the aid of the [[Valar]], who overthrew Morgoth in the [[War of Wrath]] in c. {{FA|583}}.<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref>

The House of Fingolfin was probably no more as an entity; the only known descendants were the two [[Half-elven]] sons of [[Eärendil]]; [[Elrond]] and [[Elros]], the patriarch of the [[Men|Mannish]] [[House of Elros]] and the [[Kings of Númenor]].

==Other versions of the legendarium==
The last High King of the Noldor, Ereinion Gil-galad, remained in Middle-earth. Despite having been listed as the son of Fingon in the published ''Silmarillion'', Christopher Tolkien later commented that it would have been better if he would have left Gil-Galad's parentage obscure in the published ''Silmarillion''.<ref>{{PM|XI5}}</ref>
