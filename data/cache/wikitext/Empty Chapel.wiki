== Poem excerpt ==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
:Lo, war is in your nostrils and your heart
:And burning with just anger as of old
:Though stunted in dark places far from God
:Though cheated and deluded and oppressed
:Arise you, O ye blind and dumb to war
:Come open your eyes and glorify your God
:Come sing a hymn of honour to your Queen.<ref name=collectedpoems/></poem>

== Background ==
Sometime "between late [[July]] and early [[September]]" of [[1915]], Tolkien likely attempted to write a poem about his early experience of army life. He wrote it in one of his poetry notebooks on four pages between ''[[The Swallow, and the Traveller on the Plains]]'' and ''[[A Song of Aryador|The Pines of Aryador]]''.<ref>{{CP|36}}, p. 225</ref>

In [[2024]], the most significant of the fragments were published in September as entry 36 of ''[[The Collected Poems of J.R.R. Tolkien]]''.<ref name=collectedpoems/> According to an interview conducted by Dalya Alberge of The Guardian, [[Christina Scull]], one of the editors of the collection, found the poem to be "very affecting".<ref name=interview>{{webcite|author=Dalya Alberge|articleurl=https://www.theguardian.com/books/article/2024/aug/24/beyond-bilbo-jrr-tolkiens-long-lost-poetry-to-be-published|articlename=Beyond Bilbo: JRR Tolkien’s long-lost poetry to be published|dated=24 August 2024|website=Guardian|accessed=29 August 2024}}</ref>

In the introduction to ''The Collected Poems of J.R.R. Tolkien'', ''Empty Chapel'' is described as "a haunting work with a Pre-Raphaelite air" to it.<ref name=collectedpoemsintro>{{CP|Introduction}}</ref> In their Addenda and Corrigenda, Hammond and Scull associated the mood of the poem "with Arthurian poetry and Pre-Raphaelite art", but choose not to write this in ''[[The Collected Poems of J.R.R. Tolkien]]''.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Christina Scull]] and [[Wayne G. Hammond]]|articleurl=https://www.hammondandscull.com/addenda/collected_poems_by_date.html|articlename=Addenda and Corrigenda to ''The Collected Poems of J.R.R.

On [[8 October]], Joe Hoffman noted in his blog that lines 3-9 of fragment D seem to echo [[Wikipedia:Wilfred Owen|Wilfred Owen]]'s ''[[Wikipedia:Dulce et Decorum Est|Dulce et Decorum Est]]''.<ref name=blog>{{webcite|author=Joe Hoffman|articleurl=https://www.idiosophy.com/2024/10/tolkiens-empty-chapel/|articlename=Tolkien's Empty Chapel|dated=8 October 2024|website=[https://www.idiosophy.com/ Idiosophy]|accessed=4 November 2024}}</ref>
