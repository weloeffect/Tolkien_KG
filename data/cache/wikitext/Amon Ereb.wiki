'''Amon Ereb''' ([[Sindarin|S]]. "Lonely Hill"), sometimes just '''Ereb''', was the broad, shallow-sided hill that dominated the southern plains of [[East Beleriand]].<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

==History==
The hill was the highest point in that region and the easternmost hill of [[Andram]], but was standing alone. Within sight of the [[Gelion]], it had tremendous strategic importance, because it guarded the eastern passage around the Long Wall of the Andram into the southern parts of [[East Beleriand]] and the northern [[Taur-im-Duinath]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>

It was here that [[Denethor (Nando)|Denethor]] of the [[Nandor]] met his end in the [[First Battle]].<ref>{{S|Sindar}}</ref> Much later, [[Caranthir]] fortified it to guard his escape into the south after the [[Dagor Bragollach]] in {{FA|455}}<ref>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> and the Fëanorions withdrew there after [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] in {{FA|472}}.<ref>{{WJ|11}}</ref> But only after that, in {{FA|540}},<ref>{{WJ|Years}}, p. 345</ref> [[Morgoth]] captured the hill driving the last remaining Sons of Fëanor, [[Maedhros]] and [[Maglor]], to retreat further south to the [[Isle of Balar]].<ref name="AB">{{LR|AB}}, entry for the year of the Sun 340 [540], p. 143</ref>

===Fate===
[[File:Didier Willis - Mount Dolmed and Amon Ereb.png|thumb|Collage of maps showing where Amon Ereb would be (if surviving the submersion of [[Beleriand]]).]]
A small circle appears in [[Forlindon]] on Tolkien's early draft map for ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name=Isengard>{{HM|TI}}</ref>{{rp|302}} Christopher Tolkien cannot explain this feature<ref name=Isengard />{{rp|301}} and notes that in his own 1943 redrawn map, the circular area is no longer present.<ref name=Isengard />{{rp|322}} It is possible to create a collage of the Beleriand and the Eriador maps to show the small circular area on the Third Age map coinciding with the location of Amon Ereb.<ref>See notably the maps reconstructed by [[Charles Noad]], "A Note on the Geography of the First Age" in ''[[Amon Hen (journal)|Amon Hen]]'' no. [[Amon Hen 38|38]], April 1979, reprinted in ''[[Mallorn (journal)|Mallorn]]'' no. [[Mallorn 27|27]], September 1990, p. 40; [[Ronald Kyrmse]], "The Geographical Relation between Beleriand and Eriador" in ''[[Mallorn (journal)|Mallorn]]'' no. [[Mallorn 26|26]], September 1989, pp. 25–27; [[Didier Willis]], "Du Beleriand aux confins de Rhûn" (French) in ''[[Tolkien, le façonnement d'un monde]]'' (2014), vol. 2, pp. 197-212.</ref> Noad suggests that Amon Ereb may have been once thought to have survived the submersion of Beleriand, although there is no textual evidence for it, and other Tolkienists such as [[Karen Fonstad]] have reconciled the two maps in a different way.<ref>[[Karen Wynn Fonstad]], ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'', p. 37</ref> 

==Etymology==
''Amon Ereb'' is [[Sindarin]] "Lonely Hill", from ''[[amon]]'' "hill" + ''[[ereb]]'' "isolated, lonely".

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''

In MERP, Amon Ereb does indeed survive the destruction of [[Beleriand]].
