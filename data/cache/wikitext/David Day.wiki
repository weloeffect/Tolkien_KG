'''David Day''' is a Canadian author who has written a number of books, many of them are [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]-related. Primarily known for his reference books, starting with ''[[A Tolkien Bestiary]]'' in [[1978]], Day's books have sold over 3 million copies, and have been published in over 120 different editions in over 20 languages.<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.abcbookworld.com/view_author.php?id=489|articlename=DAY, David|website=[http://www.abcbookworld.com/ ABC Bookworld]|accessed=21 January 2015}}</ref>

Despite the selling numbers, Day is notable for his tendency to fabricate false or inaccurate information in his writings, and his books have been repeatedly criticized by the Tolkien community.<!-- concrete evidences will be gradually listed in the future -->

Day rejects the charge of inaccuracy, though he accepts that his reference books have been repackaged and reprinted by publishers under different titles.<ref name="Website">{{webcite|website=[http://www.daviddaybooks.com/ David Day's site]|articleurl=http://www.daviddaybooks.com/about2.html|articlename=Books to read|accessed=5 May 2021}}</ref>

==Reputation within the Tolkien community==
[[The Tolkien Society]] does not recommend any of Day's books in their suggested readings (preferring [[Robert Foster]]'s ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'' instead)<ref>{{webcite|website=TS|articleurl=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/author/books-about-tolkien/|articlename=Books about Tolkien|accessed=21 January 2015}}</ref> whilst [[David Bratman]], editor of the ''[[Tolkien Studies (journal)|Tolkien Studies]]'' journal, makes the same suggestion that David Day's books are "Not Recommended".<ref>{{webcite|website=[https://www.dbratman.net/ David Bratman's Home Page]|articleurl=https://www.dbratman.net/tolkien_bib.html|articlename=Recommended books on Tolkien|accessed=21 January 2015}}</ref> Troels Forchammer noted in his blog that "''Day is infamous in Tolkien circles for his creative re-interpretation of Tolkien's work''"<ref>{{webcite|website=[http://parmarkenta.blogspot.co.uk Parma-kenta]|articleurl=http://parmarkenta.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/tolkien-transactions-xxxiii.html|articlename=Tolkien Transactions XXXIII|dated=1 February 2013|accessed=21 January 2015}}</ref> whilst [[Michael Martinez]] made the sterner observation that "''In Tolkien scholarship the worst insult one could deliver at any point for many years was equivalent to 'That sounds like something David Day wrote'.''"<ref>{{webcite|website=[http://blog.tolkien-studies.com/ Tolkien Studies Blog]|articleurl=http://blog.tolkien-studies.com/2007/03/07/why-wikipedia-content-cannot-be-trusted/|articlename=Why Wikipedia Content Cannot Be Trusted|dated=7 March 2007|accessed=21 January 2015}}</ref>

Tolkien Meta-FAQ author Steuard Jensen said about ''[[A Tolkien Bestiary]]'' that "''it is not wise to rely on this book for information on Tolkien's vision of Middle-earth''" and that "''it is important to be aware that a considerable number of other details in those vivid descriptions were invented by Day himself with little or no justification in the texts, and that these extrapolations are not distinguished from the justified facts in any way''".<ref name="FAQ">{{webcite|website=FAQ|articleurl=http://tolkien.slimy.com/essays/DayBooks.html|articlename=Notes on David Day's Tolkien Books|accessed=21 January 2015}}</ref> In particular, ''[[A Tolkien Bestiary]]'' (and its derivative ''[[Tolkien: The Illustrated Encyclopedia]]'') has been specifically criticised for its entries on [[Beren]], [[Giants]], [[long-worms]], [[Sauron]], [[Telcontar]]i.<ref name="FAQ" />

Most of the criticism have been to the encyclopedia style books. More recently ''The Battles of Tolkien'' has been described saying:

{{blockquote|One of the surprises to me is that this book contains genuinely new content; this isn’t just a rehashing of previous books. And the factual pieces of information on the battles and the characters are accurate: it was a pleasant surprise to me to find none of the painfully obvious errors that were common throughout the previous two books. Similarly, the chronologies – save for one inconsistency on the War of Wrath – were also accurate.|[[Shaun Gunner|Gunner, Shaun]]. "Review: ''The Battles of Tolkien''" in ''[[Amon Hen]]'' [[Amon Hen 267|267]]}}  
Having acknowledged that the book contains fewer factual errors than earlier books by Day, the reviewer describes it as "not a work of reference, but an attempt at analysis" and describing the analysis as "a bunch of clichéd theories that failed to stretch beyond a child pointing at things and exclaiming 'This is like that!'."

==A problematic map of Arda==
''[[A Tolkien Bestiary]]'' (1979) and later works includes a (unfortunately widespread) map that intentionally gives an overall view of all the lands over all the ages in a composite image. It include the Lamps, the Trees Of The Valar, Númenor, Beleriand, and the Undying Lands which never existed all at the same time. The map is criticized for differences from Tolkien's own maps such as "Map V" from the [[Ambarkanta maps|''Ambarkanta'' maps]].<ref>{{webcite|author=Stentor Danielson|website=[http://scholar.valpo.edu/journaloftolkienresearch/ Journal of Tolkien Research]|articleurl=http://scholar.valpo.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&context=journaloftolkienresearch|articlename=Extending Arda: Mapping beyond the Lord of the Rings and Silmarillion|accessed=21 January 2015}}</ref>

''[[Tolkien: The Illustrated Encyclopedia]]'' has Geography section called "The Evolution of Arda" that has 8 maps that does show the evolution of the world map throughout the ages.

The Tolkien community generally steers readers away from the Composite map and instead towards ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'' by [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] (1981, revised 1991).

==Oxonmoot controversy==
David Day attended [[Oxonmoot 2004]] yet failed to pay for his attendance. In the minutes of [[The Tolkien Society]] committee meeting held on 30 October 2004 it states that:

{{blockquote|Chris ''<nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Chris Crawshaw]], Chairman]'' has also written to David Day to ask him to pay his registration for Oxonmoot.  She was instructed by the meeting to keep badgering him about this, since he seems to feel his 'celebrity' status exempts him from such mundane details|[[Amon Hen 191|''Amon Hen'' 191]], p. 19}}

Four months later in the minutes of a committee meeting held on the 26th February 2005 it is recorded:

{{blockquote|Since David Day has still not paid his registration for Oxonmoot, it was agreed that he should be blacklisted for future events.|[[Amon Hen 193|''Amon Hen'' 193]], p. 17}}

There are no other recorded incidents of [[The Tolkien Society]] blacklisting individuals from attending their events.
