Hob was a two-feathered [[Shirriff]]. Before the War of the Ring, he had watched [[Buckland]]'s [[Buckland Gate|Hay Gate]]. He was well acquainted with the [[Brandybuck Family]].

During [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins]]'s reign over the Shire, the Shirriffs were reorganized. Hob was old, and one of several shirriffs who were to guard the new fence at the [[Brandywine Bridge]] under the command of [[Bill Ferny]].

When [[Frodo Baggins]] and his [[Travellers|companions]] returned from their adventure, they found Hob at the gate who forbade them to enter the fence gate. After they chased off Ferny, Hob informed them of the changes in their homeland.<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>
