'''Fundin''' was a [[Dwarves|dwarf]] of the royal line of [[Durin's folk]], the great-grandson of King [[Náin II]]. He was the son of [[Farin]] and the older brother of [[Gróin]]. 

==History==
Fundin was most likely born in the [[Lonely Mountain]] and went into exile with his people after the attack by the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Smaug]]. He fathered two sons, [[Balin]] and [[Dwalin]].

Fundin was killed beneath the [[East-gate of Moria]] in the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]], the final conflict of the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]]: He was part of the first assault of the vanguard that was thrown back with loss, and was driven into a wood by lake [[Mirrormere]]. 

He was slain there along with his kinsman [[Frerin]], and many others. After the battle his body was burned on a wooden pyre along with the rest of the [[Burned Dwarves|dead]].<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>

Years later, his sons, as members of [[Thorin and Company]], were involved with the [[Quest of Erebor|regaining of Lonely Mountain]]. [[Roäc]] recognised Balin as the son of Fundin.<ref>{{H|Gathering}}</ref>
