'''Dís''' (born [[Third Age]] {{TA|2760|n}}) was a [[Dwarf-women|female]] [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] of the royal line of [[Durin's folk]].

==History==
Dís was the daughter of King [[Thráin|Thráin II]] and younger sister of [[Thorin]] and [[Frerin]]. Like her brothers, she was born in [[Lonely Mountain]] and was driven into exile in {{TA|2770}} when the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Smaug]] sacked the kingdom. She was the mother of [[Fíli]] and [[Kíli]]. 

Although female Dwarves were rarely seen by outsiders, or mentioned in Dwarven records, Dís was an exceptional case: her sons were killed heroically defending their mortally wounded uncle Thorin in the [[Battle of Five Armies]].<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[Jim Allan]] has suggested that ''Dís'' is derived from [[Old Norse]] ''-dís'' ("sister") found in many Nordic names (such as ''Herdís'', ''Hjördís'', etc).<ref>[[Jim Allan]], "Giving of Names", in ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', p. 225</ref>
