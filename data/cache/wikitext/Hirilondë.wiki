'''Hirilondë''', the "Haven-finder", was a ship built by [[Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion]] and the [[Guild of Venturers]] in the shipyards of [[Rómenna]], a seaport in [[Númenor]]. People wondered at its great size and called it '''Turuphanto''', the 'Wooden Whale'.<ref name=wife>{{UT|Wife}}</ref>

Aldarion sailed with it to [[Middle-earth]] for the first time in {{SA|877}} and returned after five years, {{SA|882}}.<ref name=notes>{{UT|4a}}</ref>

There was a custom among the [[Númenóreans]]: when one of their ships set sail over the sea, a woman, usually a relative to the captain, placed a branch of [[oiolairë]] as the [[Green Bough of Return]] at the prow, but [[Erendis]], Aldarion's wife, refused to either set the bough or send one for Hirilondë. Instead, the wife of his captain at that time placed one on the ship.<ref name=wife/>

After Aldarion became [[King of Númenor]] and left towards Middle-earth once again, in {{SA|883}}, there was no Green Bough of Return on Hirilondë's prow. There stood the image of an [[eagle]] with golden beak and jewelled eyes, given to him by [[Círdan]] during his previous journeys to the [[Grey Havens]].<ref name="Wife">{{UT|Wife}}, ''The Further Course of the Narrative''</ref>
