==Reception==
Some weeks before its release, the [[Tolkien Estate]] released a statement wishing to make clear that they '''"did not approve of, authorise or participate in the making of this film"'', and that they ''"do not endorse it or its content in any way"''.<ref>{{webcite|author=Aliso Flood|articleurl=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/23/tolkien-estate-disavows-forthcoming-film-starring-nicholas-hoult|articlename=Tolkien estate disavows forthcoming film starring Nicholas Hoult|dated=23 April 2019|website=[http://www.theguardian.com The Guardian]|accessed=}}</ref>

The film received mixed reviews upon release, having a rating of 50% critic score and 71% audience score on review aggregator [[wikipedia:Rotten Tomatoes|Rotten Tomatoes]],<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tolkien |articlename=''Tolkien'' (2019) |website=Rotten Tomatoes |accessed=28 June 2023}}</ref> and an average rating of 6.8/10 on [[wikipedia:IMDb|IMDb]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3361792/ Tolkien], IMDb (accessed 28 June 2023)</ref>

Among Tolkien scholars, it is agreed that the film is hardly historically accurate.<ref name=tolkcast>[https://www.tolkcast.de/episode/010-das-special-tolkien-ein-biopic-kein-dokumentarfilm 010 Das Special: Tolkien: Ein Biopic, kein Dokumentarfilm] (german, Episode 10 of [[TolkCast]]) (accessed 28 June 2023)</ref><ref name=doug>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZZg-n3ARPI&t=1317s&ab_channel=TolkienTalk Interview with Douglas A.

Un comentario] (blog entry) (accessed 28 June 2023)</ref> [[Douglas A. Anderson]] said that he hopes "''that film passes into its deserved oblivion quickly''".<ref name=doug /> [[Eduardo Segura]] found it "''epidermic and easy to forget''".<ref name=edu /> [[Marcel Bülles]] highlighted the fact, that even though the film doesn't represent the chronology and events of Tolkien's life accurately, "''the mood, the atmosphere, it's just right''".<ref name=tolkcast /> Upon seeing the film, [[John Garth]] humorously remarked "''Dang, I have to rewrite [[Tolkien and the Great War|my book]] now''".<ref name=tolkcast />

Another criticism held at the film was the apparent absence of Tolkien's [[christianity]], despite it impacting his work.<ref>{{webcite |articleurl=https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/paul-batura-disney-tolkien-christian |articlename=Paul Batura: Disney ignores Tolkien's Christian faith in new drama |author=Paul Batura |website=Fox "News"|dated=12 May 2019 |accessed=27 October 2022}}</ref>
