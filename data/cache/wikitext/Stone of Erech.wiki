The '''Stone of Erech''' or the '''Black Stone'''<ref>{{RK|Debate}}, pp. 874, 876</ref> was a great black stone shaped like a globe, which was as high as a man, although its lower half was buried in the ground at the top of the [[Hill of Erech]].<ref name=Company>{{RK|Company}}, p. 789</ref>

== History ==
According to the lore of [[Númenor]] it had been brought out of the ruin of Númenor and had been set at the Hill of Erech by [[Isildur]] at his landing<ref name=Company/> as a symbol of his overlordship and a place of meeting<ref>{{HM|RC}}, 1996 Index, "a tryst-stone (symbol of Isildur's overlordship)", p. 530</ref> for the establishment of a covenant<ref>{{L|297}}, "Isildur set the covenant-stone"</ref> between the [[Men of the Mountains]] and the realm of [[Gondor]].<ref name=Oath>{{RK|Company}}, p. 782</ref> It is possible that the Stone of Erech was one of the heirlooms or many things "of beauty and power" or "of virtue and wonder" that the Númenoreans had created in the days of their wisdom that [[Elendil]], the father of Isildur, had loaded onto ships that were anchored off the east coast of Númenor for a possible evacuation of the [[Faithful]] from Númenor.<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> Near the end of the [[Second Age]], in the beginning of the realm of Gondor the [[King of the Dead|King of the Mountains]] swore allegiance to Isildur at the stone. After [[Sauron]] had returned and become powerful Isildur summoned the Men of the Mountains to fulfill their oath to fight with Gondor in the upcoming [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|war]] with Sauron. However, they refused, because they had worshipped Sauron during the [[Dark Years]]. As a consequence, Isildur cursed the King of the Mountains and his [[Oathbreakers|people]] to find no rest until their oath was fulfilled and said to the king that he would be the last king of his people. The Men of the Mountains fled and hid in secret locations in the mountains, did not have contact with other people and slowly dwindled. After their death their spirits found no rest and spread terror near the Hill of Erech and all places where they had lived.<ref name=Oath/>

The dead spirits of the Men of the Mountains haunted the [[Paths of the Dead|caverns]] beneath the [[Dwimorberg]] and their [[wraiths]] appeared in the valley of [[Harrowdale]] that lay in the mountain's shadow in times of trouble and coming death and caused the local people to lock themselves in their houses in fear.<ref>{{RK|Muster}}, p. 797</ref> They believed that the Stone had fallen from the sky.<ref name="Grey">{{RK|V2}}</ref> The wraiths of the dead also filled the population near the Hill of Erech with fear, who knew that the host of the wraiths was led by the [[King of the Dead]].<ref name=Company/>
		 	
In the time of King [[Arvedui]] of [[Arthedain]] a prophecy was made regarding the arising of the dead during the [[War of the Ring]]. In this prophecy the Stone of Erech was mentioned:<ref name=Prophecy>{{RK|Company}}, p. 781</ref>

When the [[Grey Company]] came to [[Rohan]] the sons of [[Elrond]] brought with them a reminder of these words from their father to [[Aragorn]], who acted upon these words to brave the Paths of the Dead.<ref name=Prophecy/>

During the [[War of the Ring]], on 8 March {{TA|3019}}<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019, March 8, p. 1093</ref> Isildur's Heir, [[Aragorn]] passed through the Paths of the Dead with the [[Grey Company]] and commanded the Dead who lingered there to let them pass and to come to the Stone of Erech. The Dead followed him through the Paths of the Dead and the [[Blackroot Vale]] south of the White Mountains to the Stone of Erech. There Aragorn commanded the Oathbreakers to follow him to [[Pelargir]] and announced that he would hold the oath fulfilled when all the servants of Sauron have been removed from this land.<ref>{{RK|Company}}, pp. 787-9</ref> The Dead fulfilled their oath and drove away the allies of Sauron through fear at the fords over the river [[Gilrain]] at [[Linhir]] on 11 March<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019, March 11, p. 1093</ref> and at [[Pelargir]] on 13 March.<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019, March 13, p. 1093</ref> In return for their aid, at the shore of the river [[Anduin]] at Pelargir, Aragorn held their oath as fulfilled, commanded them to never again trouble the valleys, to depart and to be at rest.<ref>{{RK|Debate}}, pp. 874-6</ref>

== Etymology ==
The name ''Erech'', like many names in Gondor, is of forgotten [[Mannish]] [[pre-Númenórean]] origin.<ref>{{App|Men}}, p. 1129</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In early manuscripts the Stone of Erech seems to be a [[Palantíri|Palantír]], because Aragorn says that that there are other Stones in this ancient land and that one is at Erech after he had looked into the Stone (i.e. the Palantír) of Orthanc.<ref>{{WR|3|IV}}, pp. 300-2, 304, 309 (note 10)</ref> In later manuscripts, a ring-wall existed around the Stone of Erech and a tower with a Palantír stood next to it.<ref>{{WR|3|XII}}, pp. 397, 410</ref> The last of these later manuscripts mentions that the Stone of Erech was brought from Númenor before its fall when its ships came to the western coasts of Middle-earth.<ref>{{WR|3|XII}}, p. 410</ref>

:The Stone of Erech is named '''Orossar''' and is reimagined as one of the seven ''Vandassari'' (''Oath-stones'' in [[Quenya]]) brought from Númenor. They are the "seven stones" from the rhyme spoken by [[Gandalf]], while the [[Palantíri]] are revealed to be the "seven stars". The stones had in them the power that made the oaths sworn in their presence more potent, and thus they were divided much like the palantíri (three to [[Arnor]] and four to [[Gondor]]) to make pacts friendship with the non-[[Dúnedain]] peoples of [[Middle-earth]].
