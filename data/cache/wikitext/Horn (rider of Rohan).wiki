==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2012: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Riders of Rohan]]'':'''
:Horn is a prominent character in the game and accompanies the player throughout all of their travels in Riddermark. 

:Horn's ultimate fate depends on a decision made by the player much earlier in the game. During the summoning of the [[Grey Company]], Halros can be persuaded to either journey south to the aid of [[Aragorn]] or stay and perform the very task that Aragorn instructed him to do. If Halros stays in the Shire, Horn dies in the [[battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. However, if Halros is persuaded to go south, he shields Horn from the mortal blow at the cost of his own life. Horrified by the death around him and the sacrifice of a man he didn't even know, Horn loses his will to go on and abandons his duty. He forsakes his name and, now a broken man, leaves into paths unknown, telling the player to report him as dead.
