The '''Battle of the Peak''' was [[Gandalf|Gandalf's]] name for his climactic battle with the [[Balrogs|Balrog]] known as [[Durin's Bane]], on the peak of the mountain called [[Celebdil|Silvertine]].

Gandalf pursued the Balrog from the deepests dungeons of [[Moria]] to [[Durin's Tower]], climbing through the whole [[Endless Stair]].<ref name="White">{{TT|III5}}, p. 502</ref> On the peak they fought for three days and two nights from [[23 January|23]] to [[25 January]] {{TA|3019}}.<ref>{{App|Great}}, p. 1092</ref> During the battle, the Tower was destroyed and the entrance to the Stair was blocked. In the end, the Balrog was cast down and it broke the mountain-side as it fell. Gandalf himself died following this ordeal, but was later sent back to [[Middle-earth]] with even greater powers as Gandalf the White.<ref name="White"/>
