}}'''Ostoher''' ({{TA|222}}<ref name="Elendil">{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> – {{TA|492|n}},<ref>{{App|South}}</ref> aged 270) was the seventh [[King of Gondor]].

==History==
In {{TA|420}}, Ostoher rebuilt and enlarged [[Minas Anor]].<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> Upon completion, he made Minas Anor his summer residence, which became the tradition of his successors.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

Later, in {{TA|490}}, [[Gondor]] was invaded for the first time by [[Easterlings]].  Since Ostoher had become an old man his son [[Tarostar]] worked to defeat this threat.  Tarostar succeeded, but not until {{TA|500}}, years after Ostoher's death.<ref name="TA"/>

==Etymology==
''Ostoher'' is [[Quenya]]. Its meaning is not glossed, but Paul Strack explains that it seems to mean "City Lord" and seems to be a compound of [[osto]] ("city", "fortress") and [[heru]] ("lord").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-2433255139.html|articlename=Q.
