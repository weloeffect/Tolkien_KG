The '''Barrow-wights''' were a kind of [[undead]]-like creatures, dead bones animated by [[evil spirits]].<ref name="LotR">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''passim''</ref>

==History and Characteristics==
[[File:Richard Svensson - The Adventures of Tom Bombadil part 4.jpg|thumb|''The Adventures of Tom Bombadil part 4'' by Richard Svensson]]
The Barrow-wights were evil spirits, although their true nature is unknown; it is not known if they were perverted [[Maiar]] ([[Úmaiar]]) or [[Fëa and hröa|spirits]] of [[Orcs]], fallen [[Avari]], or evil Men. 

The [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]] sent them to the [[Barrow-downs]], in order to prevent a resurrection of the destroyed [[Dúnedain]] kingdom of [[Cardolan]]. Some of them occupied the cairn of the [[last prince of Cardolan]].<ref name="Eriador" /><ref>{{HM|RC}}, "Fog on the Barrow-downs", pp. 144-5; Index, 'Cardolan, [[Last prince of Cardolan|last prince of]]'</ref> The spirits stirred the dead bones in the mounds and haunted them.<ref name="Eriador">{{App|Eriador}}</ref><ref name="Elendil">{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 194</ref><ref name="I7">{{FR|I7}}</ref>

The Barrow-wights appeared as shadowy figures with a pale, icy light gleaming from what would be their eyes. They could speak, with deep, hollow and cold voices, and likewise their touch was icy.<ref name="Barrow" /><ref name="AB1" /> They were furthermore infamous for carrying rattling gold rings on their bony fingers.<ref name="I7" /><ref name="AB2">{{AB|2}}</ref>

According to [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] verse, [[Tom Bombadil]] escaped a Barrow-wight on some occasion, using his enchanting incantations.<ref name="AB1" /> Perhaps his authority was sourced by the inherent power he had on this region of the world, not the spirits themselves.

During the [[War of the Ring]] ([[September]] {{TA|3018|n}}) the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] entered Cardolan around September 24. Their chief, the [[Witch-king]], moved to [[Andrath]] and visited the Barrow-downs, where he stayed for three days in order to rouse the Barrow-wights. According to the rare manuscript ''[[The Hunt for the Ring|The Hunt for the Ring: Time Scheme - Black Riders]]'', the [[Witch King]] empowered the Barrow-wights and slew the [[Ranger]]s in order to trap the [[Ring]]-bearer - a strategy that would almost work; he left on September 27.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, "Fog on the Barrow-downs", p. 145-6</ref><ref name="RC">{{HM|RC}}, "Flight to the Ford", p. 180</ref><ref>{{UT|Other}}</ref> 

[[Frodo Baggins]] and company were trapped in the [[Barrow-downs]] by the [[magic|spells]] of the Barrow-wights, and were nearly slain by the creatures.<ref name="Barrow">{{FR|I8}}</ref> They were saved in the last minute by Tom, who seemed to have had complete authority over them.

==Other names==

According to [[Elrond]], the [[Elves]] knew the Barrow-wights by many names.<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref> While these names are not recorded (except for the general denomination "evil spirits"), the creatures were also called "'''Barrow-dwellers'''" in Hobbit lore.<ref name="AB1">{{AB|1}}</ref> Often, they were also referred to by the shortened form "'''Wights'''".<ref name="LotR" /><ref>The use of a capital "W" for the short form was noted by {{webcite|author=Jerome Colburn|articleurl=https://tolkienlistsearch.herokuapp.com/message/5e9c35dd6beb162366dc0f94|articlename=Re: tolkienian english (197.11)|dated=2002-11-24|website=[[Elfling]]|accessed=2022-09-23}}; compare "''They are Elvish wights''", in {{RK|Company}}</ref>

*Etymology: ''[[Barrows|barrow]]'' + ''[[wights|wight]]''

==Other versions of the legendarium==
Due to his inspiration from ''Hrómundar saga Gripssonar'', during the writing of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (see ''[[The History of The Lord of the Rings]]'') Tolkien at first foresaw a link between the wights and the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraith]]s, initially describing the Black Riders as horsed Wights, but the suggestion that they were the same kind of creatures was dropped in the published work. In the final work there remained a link between them: the wights were now spirits sent by the Witch-king.

==Other writings==
The character Tídwald, appearing in [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s poem "[[The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth|The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm's Son]]", accuses Torhthelm of fancying "''barrow-wights and bogeys''".<ref>{{HB|II}}</ref>
