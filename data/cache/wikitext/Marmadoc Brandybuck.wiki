'''Marmadoc "Masterful" Brandybuck''' was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of [[the Shire]].

==History==
Marmadoc was the son of [[Madoc Brandybuck]] and [[Hanna Goldworthy]]. He married [[Adaldrida Bolger]] and had four children; two sons, [[Gorbadoc Brandybuck|Gorbadoc]] and [[Orgulas Brandybuck|Orgulas]], and two daughters.<ref>{{App|Brandybuck}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The meaning of the name ''Marmadoc'' is unknown. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] noted that the names of the Bucklanders had a vaguely [[Celtic]] style.<ref name="Translation">{{App|Translation}}, p. 1135</ref>

[[Jim Allan]] suggests that the name was inspired by the name ''Marmaduke'', spelled ''Marmaduc'' in medieval times, which is derived from Irish ''Maelmadoc'' ("Servant-(of)-Maedoc"). It is possible that this is a reference to the first name of his father, [[Madoc Brandybuck]], and that the first name of his grandfather [[Gormadoc Brandybuck]] is in turn a reference to the first name of Madoc Brandybuck.<ref>{{HM|IE}}, "Giving of Names", p. 203</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In an earlier version of the family tree for the [[Brandybucks]], his name was ''Marmaduc''.<ref>{{PM|Trees}}, Brandybuck of Buckland, BR 5</ref>
