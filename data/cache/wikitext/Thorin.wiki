'''Thorin II''', also known as '''Thorin Oakenshield''', was the [[Kings of Durin's Folk|King of Durin's Folk]] from {{TA|2850}} until his death in {{TA|2941}}, being the son of [[Thráin|Thráin II]], grandson of [[Thrór]] and older brother to [[Frerin]] and [[Dís]]. Thorin led [[Durin's Folk]] of the [[Blue Mountains]] during their time in exile. In {{TA|2941}} he led the [[Quest of Erebor|quest]] for [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] accompanied by twelve [[Dwarves]], [[Bilbo Baggins]], and [[Gandalf|Gandalf the Grey]]; he briefly became [[King under the Mountain]] until he perished following the [[Battle of Five Armies]].<ref>{{App|A3}}; {{UT|9}}; {{H|10}}; {{App|B2}}</ref>

==History==
===Youth and exile===
Thorin was born in {{TA|2746}}, presumably in the Lonely Mountain where his grandfather, [[Thrór]], was King under the Mountain. Thorin was still a youngster (aged c. 24), by Dwarves' reckoning, when the dragon [[Smaug]] descended upon the mountain of Erebor in flames. Smaug left the mannish town of [[Dale]] in ruins and killed many dwarves who were inside the mountain. Thrór and Thráin (Thorin's father) escaped using a secret [[Back Door]]. Meanwhile Thorin was one of the few Dwarves who were not inside the mountain at the time. Thus the surviving [[Dwarves of Erebor]] were driven into exile and Thrór, Thráin, and Thorin fled south and ended up to [[Dunland]].<ref name="AppA3" /><ref name="H1" />

===War of the Dwarves and Orcs===
Disillusioned, Thorin's grandfather Thrór wandered to the [[Great Gates|Eastern gate]] of [[Moria]], the old mansion of the [[Longbeards]], now infested by [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains|Orcs]]. He entered it and ended up murdered and desecrated by the Orc [[Azog]]. These news were brought by his companion [[Nár]] to Thráin, thus the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]] began.<ref name="AppA3" />
[[File:Mikel Janin - Battle of Azanulbizar.jpeg|left|thumb|''Battle of Azanulbizar'' by [[:Category:Images by Mikel Janin|Mikel Janin]]]]
The war was fought long and hard between the two races, ultimately ending in a pyrrhic Dwarven victory at the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] in {{TA|2799}}. Both Thráin and Thorin were wounded during this battle and [[Frerin]] (Thorin's brother) was killed. When his shield broke, he cut a bough from an oak tree to block the blows of his foes.<ref>{{App|A3}}, note 46.</ref> Despite victory no Dwarf dared to re-enter [[Moria]] out of fear of [[Durin's Bane]].<ref name="App|A3">{{App|A3}}; {{App|B2}}</ref>

In memory of this, Thorin swore to always bear a plain shield of oak with no device until he should be hailed king,<ref>{{PM|Aiv}}</ref> and thus he earned the epithet '''Oakenshield'''.

===Return into exile===
[[File:Charles Burggraf - We will get it back.jpg|thumb|right|left|''"We will get it back"'' by [[:Category:Images by Charles Burggraf|Charles Burggraf]]]]
Thráin, Thorin, and the other survivors of [[Durin's Folk]] left Azanulbizar and returned to [[Dunland]]. However they soon began to wander [[Eriador]] before settling at last in the [[Blue Mountains]]. Here they prospered in their own fashion, forging iron objects and increasing their numbers (albeit, due to a scarceness of [[Dwarf-women]], very slowly, and by wandering Longbeards who heard of his dwelling). Nonetheless they all still longed to return to the Lonely Mountain.<ref name="AppA3" />

By this time Thráin was in possession of [[Ring of Thrór|the last]] of the [[Seven Rings]] of power. It is possible that as [[Sauron]]'s power grew so too did the ring's influence over Thráin. His burning desire for gold and to return to the Lonely Mountain became too great and in {{TA|2841}} he set out to return. Thorin, then aged ninety-five, was never to see his father again, as Sauron captured and imprisoned Thráin in [[Dol Guldur]]. Thus it was that around Thráin 's disappearance and death ({{TA|2850}}) Thorin became the [[Kings of Durin's Folk|King of Durin's Folk]]. Thorin and his people were content living in the [[Blue Mountains]] and [[Eriador]] but as the years waned Thorin's desire to return to Erebor grew.<ref name="App|A3" />

===Quest for Erebor===
<!--Insert basic storyline of The Hobbit-->
====A new hope====
{{quote|Listen to me, Thorin Oakenshield! [...] If this hobbit goes with you, you will succeed. If not, you will fail. A foresight is on me, and I am warning you.|[[Gandalf]]<ref name="UT9">{{UT|9}}</ref>}}
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Gandalf and Thorin.jpg|thumb|''Gandalf and Thorin'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
The fortunes of the House of Durin changed when Thorin met [[Gandalf]] by chance in {{TA|2941}}.<ref group="note">Different accounts dispute the exact location of this first meeting. One source states that it occurred at an Inn in [[Bree]]. Whilst another states that Thorin started talking to Gandalf when he overtook him on the road.</ref> They then proceeded to go to [[Thorin's Halls]]. There they discussed their tales and Gandalf formulated a plan. Gandalf knew that Sauron could have potentially used Smaug with devastating effect. Therefore both he and Thorin had a shared interest in removing Smaug. Gandalf wanted Thorin and a company of dwarves to travel to the Lonely Mountain taking [[Bilbo Baggins]] with them. Gandalf's instinct was that the [[Quest of Erebor]] would only be successful if Bilbo accompanied them.

Therefore Gandalf invited Thorin and other Dwarves to [[Hobbiton]] of [[the Shire]], instructing them to look for a [[Smials|smial]] whose door was marked with the sign of the thief (as the dwarves had gotten it into their head that Bilbo was a thief). Thus Thorin found himself in [[Bag End]], where they perused the hobbit's hospitality. However, Thorin and the dwarves were not convinced; it was not until Gandalf revealed [[Thrór's Map]] and key that Thorin was convinced that the quest would be profitable to him. Even after the "[[An Unexpected Party|Unexpected Party]]" Gandalf only persuaded Thorin to take Bilbo on the morning that they set off.<ref>{{App|A3}}; {{UT|9}}</ref>

Thus it was that in {{TA|2941}} Thorin set off for the Lonely Mountain with Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, [[Fíli]], [[Kíli]], [[Balin]], [[Dwalin]], [[Dori]], [[Nori]], [[Ori]], [[Óin]], [[Glóin]], [[Bifur]], [[Bofur]], and [[Bombur]]. A short time into the journey the adventurers found a Troll's cave. Here they found a hoard of treasure which included blades made in the ancient city of [[Gondolin]]. Bilbo found a knife that he named [[Sting]], Gandalf acquired [[Glamdring]] and meanwhile Thorin found [[Orcrist]].<ref name="H2"></ref> Whilst [[Thorin and Company]] were in [[Rivendell]] [[Elrond]] read the inscriptions on the blades and informed them of their sword's histories. He also read the [[moon-letters]] on Thrór's map; it read "''stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks [...] and the setting sun with the last light of [[Durin's Day]] will shine upon the keyhole.''"<ref>{{H|3}}</ref>

====Return of the King under the Mountain====
[[File:David T. Wenzel - Thorin in Esgaroth.jpg|thumb|left|''Thorin in Esgaroth'' by [[David T. Wenzel]]]]
Upon reaching [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]], the closest settlement to the Lonely Mountain, Thorin was greeted warmly and the men of Lake-town hailed the return of the [[King under the Mountain]].<ref name="H10">{{H|10}}</ref> They soon reached the Lonely Mountain itself and "''with the last light of Durin's Day''" they found the secret side-door, using the key to open it.<ref>{{H|11}}</ref> Thorin sent Bilbo in to carry out his duty as their 'esteemed burglar'. This enraged Smaug who sought to destroy the burglar and take out his vengeance on the [[Lake-men]].<ref>{{H|12}}</ref> The dragon was slain by [[Bard]] who pierced an un-armoured spot on the dragon's underside <ref>{{H|14}}</ref> with a [[Black Arrow]].

Upon hearing the news of the death of Smaug, Thorin fortified the main entrance to the mountain. Hosts of [[Elves of Mirkwood|Wood-elves]] and Lake-men approached the mountain led by the [[Thranduil|Elvenking]] and Bard respectively. Thorin refused to consider Bard's claim to a share in the treasure until the Elven-host had withdrawn. Refusing to send away the Elves, Bard pronounced the mountain under siege until Thorin would give them their part of the treasure. Then Thorin sent for his cousin, [[Dáin Ironfoot]], who brought more than five-hundred Dwarves from the [[Iron Hills]].<ref>{{H|15}}; {{H|16}}</ref> Bilbo sought to bring an end to the dispute; to this end he secretly gave the [[Arkenstone]] to Bard and the Elvenking to use in making a deal with Thorin. When Thorin heard about Bilbo's actions he was furious and cast him out of the company.<ref>{{H|17}}</ref>

====Death====
[[File:Darrell Sweet - The Death of Thorin Oakenshield.jpg|thumb|right|''The Death of Thorin Oakenshield'' by [[Darrell Sweet]]]]
However, all disputes were cast aside when the army of [[Bolg]], Azog's son, suddenly attacked. Thus the three armies of [[Elves]], [[Men]], and [[Dwarves]] united against the two armies of [[Orcs|Goblins]] and [[Wargs]]: the [[Battle of Five Armies]] had begun. As the battle drew on, Thorin leapt from the front gate and rallied all Elves, Men, and Dwarves to him. The armies of the [[free peoples]] of [[Middle-earth]] emerged triumphant. Nonetheless [[Kíli]] and [[Fíli]] were killed and Thorin was gravely wounded. On his deathbed Thorin apologised to Bilbo for his angry words and deeds. He commended his good character, courage and friendship, saying that ''"if more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world."'' With that, he died. He was laid to rest deep within the Lonely Mountain. [[Bard]] of [[Dale]] placed the Arkenstone upon Thorin's chest, whilst the Elvenking laid Orcrist upon Thorin's tomb.<ref>{{H|17}}; {{H|18}}</ref>

==Characteristics==
===Appearance===
{{quote|It was Thorin, but you could only have told it by his golden chain, and by the colour of his now dirty and tattered sky-blue hood with its tarnished silver tassel.|''[[The Hobbit]]'', "[[Barrels Out of Bond]]"}}

Thorin had a white beard<ref name="History">{{HH|7iv}}</ref> and wore a sky-blue hood with a long silver tassel. Around his neck he wore a golden chain, upon which he attached his grandfather's key.<ref name="H1" /> He wore a belt of gold and jewels,<ref name="History" /> and his stockings were yellow. He was also said to be quite tall for a dwarf, though his height was otherwise negligible compared to other races.<ref name="H2"></ref>

===Personality===
{{quote|Thorin did not live to enjoy his triumph or his treasure. Pride and greed overcame him in spite of my warning.|[[Gandalf]]<ref name="UT9"/>}}

Thorin was capable of being stubborn, proud, and greedy. According to Gandalf he was, from the beginning, contemptuous about the notion that [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] should go with him on his long-desired adventure to the Lonely Mountain; he thought that Gandalf was trying to mock him and make him look foolish. Indeed, Thorin found it difficult to accept the advice of Gandalf at all, believing that he should have been drawing plans for war and battle rather than planning to use a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] as a burglar. He gradually came to respect the Hobbit's value to his quest as Bilbo again and again proved his stealth and courage. Thorin's most coveted prize was the [[Arkenstone]], something which Bilbo believed was not only the heart of the mountain but the heart of Thorin also.<ref>{{UT|9}}; {{H|17}}; {{H|18}}</ref>

Another one of his distinctive characteristics was that on important occasions he had the habit of going on "without telling any one there anything that was not known already".<ref name="H1" /> Once he referred to Fíli and Kíli as "sons of my father's daughter" rather than "nephews" or "sister-sons", for instance.<ref name="H10" />

===Weapons===
Thorin was a formidable swordsman, archer, and skilled military leader, capable of rallying Men, Elves and Dwarves to his side in the Battle of the Five Armies. He was the owner of the elven blade known as Orcrist, The Goblin Cleaver, a legendary sword from Gondolin that was said to have slain hundreds of goblins. When orcs or goblins were nearby, it glowed blue. He used this blade throughout the entire Quest of Erebor, but was taken from him during his capture in Mirkwood. It was then later laid on his tomb, after his death to warn Erebor of any oncoming dark forces that would dare try to take over the Mountain 

==Etymology==
Thorin's name is one from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. It means "Bold".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

The epithet "[[Oakenshield]]" also comes from the ''Dvergatal''. ''Eikinskjaldi'' means "Oakenshield", and it has long been considered the name of a Dwarf. However, because the name appears twice, both in Dúrinn's and Dválinn's line, it has also been suggested that it simply means "with an oaken shield".<ref>P.H. Salus, Taylor Beekman, "[http://pao.chadwyck.co.uk.proxy-ub.rug.nl/articles/displayItemPage.do?FormatType=fulltextimages&QueryType=articles&ResultsID=12E4F77F8FAA34BB2&ItemNumber=9&PageNumber=1 'Eikinskjaldi, Fjalarr', and 'Eggþer': Notes on Dwarves and Giants in the 'Völuspá'"], published in ''[[wikipedia:Neophilologus|Neophilologus]]'' Vol 53 (1969), Issue #1, pp. 76-81</ref>

Like many [[Dwarvish]] names, both Þorinn and Eikinskjaldi appear in the [[Norse]] poem [[Völuspá]], but there they are the names of two individual dwarves.<ref>{{HH|A3}}</ref>
	
[[Tolkien fandom|Fans]] have speculated that Tolkien may possibly have been inspired by a [[Wikipedia:Kvæði|Faroese ballad]], "[[Wikipedia:Regin|Regin]] Smiður", in which [[Wikipedia:Sigurd|Sigurd]] uses an oak tree branch as a weapon:<ref>{{webcite|author=Various|articleurl=http://www.lotrplaza.com/showthread.php?33053-Influence-of-the-Sigurd-legend-on-parts-of-The-Hobbit|articlename=Influence of the Sigurd legend on parts of ''The Hobbit''?|dated=|website=Plaza|accessed=14 March 2013}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In early manuscripts of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the name ''[[Gandalf]]'' was used by Tolkien for the character who later would be named "Thorin Oakenshield" in the published works.<ref>{{HH|Intro}}</ref>

The statement that Thráin II and his son Thorin settle in the South of Ered Luin beyond the Shire in the year 2802 was added to the entry for the year 2799 of the Third Age in Appendix B in the second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 715</ref>.

:Thorin's voice is provided by [[Hans Conried]]. Rather than remaining within Erebor until the Battle of Five Armies is nearly lost, he marched out with his companions to join the Dwarves of the Iron Hills in facing the allied armies of Mirkwood and Laketown. Upon witnessing the approach of the Goblin-Wolf army, Thorin abruptly addresses the elf king in friendly terms. The two then join forces with Bard and fight throughout the ensuing battle.

Thorin, however, does have streaks of gray in his black hair.

:In the prologue which flashes back to the [[Sack of Erebor]], Thorin is shown to be a natural leader, and is distressed when [[Thranduil]] and his army do not come to the Dwarves' aid. Later, during a flashback to the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] (referred to as the '''Battle of [[Moria]]''' in these films), his natural leadership is again on display, when rallying the troops after maiming [[Azog]] the Defiler ([[Dáin Ironfoot]], who killed Azog during this battle in the book, is not present at all).

:Thorin shows up later than expected at [[Bag End]]. He is thoroughly sceptical of [[Gandalf]]'s choice of [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] as the fourteenth member of the Company, but the [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] finally earns his approval after attempting to save him from Azog and his [[Orcs|Orc]] pack. After this ordeal, Gandalf revives him on the [[Carrock]].

:Prior to obtaining Orcrist, Thorin wields a Dwarven sword named Deathless.

'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''
:Thorin is captured by the [[Elves of Mirkwood]] along with all of the other Dwarves. He refuses to bargain with Thranduil on order to set them all free, still holding a grudge over the Elven-king not helping his people while [[Smaug]] destroyed their home.

:After the Dwarves are caught trying to steal weapons out of the armoury in [[Lake-town]], Thorin promises the people a share of the treasure if the Company is allowed to reclaim their kingdom. After Bilbo's audience with Smaug, he leads the Dwarves in a battle in an attempt to defeat the [[Dragons|Dragon]] by drowning him in molten gold. The plan fails, however, and Smaug instead heads off in a rage to Lake-town.

'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''
:While searching the treasure hoard inside the Mountain for the [[Arkenstone]], Thorin increasingly falls prey to Dragon sickness. He begins to be paranoid that the other Dwarves are scheming against him. He orders the other Dwarves to put up barricades to prevent anyone else from entering the Mountain, even as the [[Battle of Five Armies]] commences. He eventually overcomes his sickness and comes to his senses, leading the members of the Company into battle.

:On [[Ravenhill]], he attempts to take out the Orc army's leader, and old nemesis, Azog (with the help of [[Fíli]], [[Kíli]] and [[Dwalin]]). After his nephews are killed, Thorin takes on the Pale Orc one-on-one (and, in the process, gets [[Orcrist]] back from [[Legolas]]). He manages to get Azog to fall into a frozen lake, but the Orc stabs through the ice and mortally wounds him. With his last strength, Thorin plunges Orcrist into Azog's chest, finally killing him. Soon after, right before succumbing to his wounds, he makes amends with Bilbo, and dies right there on the lake.
