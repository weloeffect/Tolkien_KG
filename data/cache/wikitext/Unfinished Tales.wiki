'''''Unfinished Tales of Númenor and Middle-earth''''', or simply '''''Unfinished Tales''''', is a collection of stories and essays by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] that were never completed during his lifetime, but were edited by his son [[Christopher Tolkien]] and published in [[1980]].

Many of the tales within are retold in ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', albeit in modified forms; the work also contains a summary of the events of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' told from a less personal perspective.

==Overview==
Unlike ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', also published posthumously (in [[1977]]), for which the narrative fragments were modified to connect into a consistent and coherent work, the ''Unfinished Tales'' are presented as Tolkien left them, with little more than names changed (the author having had a confusing habit of trying out different names for a character while writing a draft). Thus some of these are incomplete stories, while others are collections of information about [[Middle-earth]]. Each tale is followed by a long series of notes explaining inconsistencies and obscure points.

As with ''The Silmarillion'', Christopher Tolkien edited and published ''Unfinished Tales'' before he had finished his study of the materials in his father's archive. ''Unfinished Tales'' provides more detailed information about characters, events and places mentioned only briefly in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Versions of such tales, including the origins of [[Gandalf]] and the other [[Istari]] (Wizards), the death of [[Isildur]] and the loss of the [[One Ring]] in the [[Gladden Fields]], and the founding of the kingdom of [[Rohan]], help expand knowledge about Middle-earth.

Of particular note is the tale of [[Tar-Aldarion]] and [[Erendis]], the only known story of [[Númenor]] before its fall. A map of Númenor, the only one Tolkien ever made, is included in the book.

The commercial success of ''Unfinished Tales'' demonstrated that the demand for Tolkien's stories several years after his death was not only still present but growing. Encouraged by the result, Christopher Tolkien embarked upon the more ambitious twelve-volume work entitled ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'' which encompasses nearly the entire corpus of his father's writings about Middle-earth.
