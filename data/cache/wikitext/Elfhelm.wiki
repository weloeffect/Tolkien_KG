'''Elfhelm''' was the marshal who governed the Riders and other armed men of the garrison of [[Edoras]] from {{TA|3012|n}} to {{TA|3019|n}}.<ref name="UTapp">{{UT|Isen}}, Appendix (i)</ref> He led his [[Éored]] during the [[War of the Ring]]. After the funeral of king [[Théoden]], he was made [[Marshal of the East-mark]] of [[Rohan]] by King [[Éomer]].<ref name="UTapp" />

==History==
In the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]] on [[25 February]] {{TA|3019}}, Elfhelm had been riding in haste from Edoras, leading four companies in answer to Théodred's summons. When he reached the junction of the horse-road and the [[Deeping-road|road]] down from the Deeping, his outriders reported that two [[wolf-riders]] had been seen abroad on the fields. Sensing that something was amiss, he did not turn aside to [[Helm's Deep]] for the night as he had intended but rode with all speed towards the [[Fords of Isen]]. And though his men and horses were weary, as he came in sight of the east banks, he ordered his companies to charge.<ref name="Isen">{{UT|Isen}}</ref> The king's son, [[Théodred]], was struck down by a great orc-man just as [[Grimbold]] reach him on a knoll east of the river. Grimbold himself was in mortal peril but Elfhelm, leading four companies of riders, charged in and saved his life. Together Elfhelm and Grimbold found that Théodred was still alive, but only long enough to speak his last words.

Prior to the [[Second Battle of the Fords of Isen]] on 2 March, the news of Théodred's death caused [[Erkenbrand]] of [[Westfold]] to assume command of the [[West-mark]]. He kept Grimbold in charge of the field. Elfhelm, of the [[Muster of Edoras]], remained independent, but coordinated his efforts with Grimbold. Elfhelm deemed the Fords to be a trap and set his companies to the east of the river to hold up the enemy's advance (that they would advance soon was an opinion shared by both men). Grimbold put foot-soldiers on both sides of the Fords with Théodred's remaining cavalry on the east bank.

When the Second Battle began [[Saruman]]'s forces heavily engaged the western forts and put troops of Uruks across the Fords. Grimbold had to retreat to the eastern bank of the Isen. At midnight Saruman's forces, now reinforced, attacked. Grimbold looked for aid from Elfhelm but none came; the greater part of Saruman's host came between Grimbold and Elfhelm and drove the latter eastwards.<ref name="Isen"/> At this point [[Gandalf]] appeared and gave orders that Elfhelm ride to Edoras.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, note 17</ref>

After the [[Battle of Helm's Deep]], at [[Harrowdale]], Elfhelm was assigned to lead the first ''éored'' of the Muster of the [[East-mark]].<ref name="UTapp"/> During the ride to [[Gondor]] the men of Elfhelm's command ignored [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] riding with [[Dernhelm]]. Eventually Elfhelm spoke to Merry after he tripped over him in the dark and told him that the drums he heard were those of the [[Woses]] in [[Drúadan Forest]]. After the ride through these woods Elfhelm described to the king and [[Éomer]] the lay of the land just before [[Minas Tirith]] since he had been there in days of peace. Just before the charge across the [[Pelennor Fields]] ([[25 March]] {{TA|3019|n}}) King Théoden placed Elfhelm and his command on the right.<ref>{{RK|V5}}</ref> After the initial charge, the right wing of the Rohirrim was closest to the walls of Minas Tirith and Elfhelm's riders tore into the [[Orcs]] about the siege-engines and drove their foes into the fire-pits.<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref>

After the [[Battle of Pelennor Fields]], Elfhelm led three thousand Rohirrim up towards the Drúadan Forest, to destroy the last foes left of Mordor's force that had crossed the [[Anduin]] and had been assigned to block the northward road.<ref>{{RK|V9}}</ref> These Orcs and [[Easterlings]] actually were leaving [[Anórien]] by the time Elfhelm's riders caught up with them and they fled to [[Cair Andros]].<ref>{{RK|V10}}</ref>

Elfhelm was one of the chief witnesses at the coronation of [[Aragorn]] on [[1 May]], {{TA|3019|n}}.<ref>{{RK|VI5}}</ref> King Éomer appointed Elfhelm to the new title [[Marshal of the East-mark]] that he created.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}, p. 470</ref>

'''2001-2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'':'''
:A [[Decipher]] card identifies a background character in Edoras from ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' as Elfhelm.

'''2012: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Elfhelm comes from the village of Faldham in the [[Eastemnet]]. Eflhelm himself first appears during the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]], arriving too late to save Prince Théodred's life. During the [[Second Battle of the Fords of Isen]] Eflhelm and his men are cut off from [[Erkenbrand]] and he orders a retreat. [[Grimbold]] refuses to follow him, continuing to fight on and defend Théodred's grave, and Elfhelm has no choice but to leave him behind, even though he feels terrible for it. After [[Gandalf]] found Elfhelm and ordered Elfhelm to ride to Edoras, he makes a brief stop in Grimbold's home town of [[Grimslade]] and, after making short work of Saruman's orcs harassing it, brings Grimbold's wife Hildith the news of her husband, apologizing for not doing more for him.
:Elfhelm is next met during the journey of the Rohirrim through the Druadan Forest. Elfhelm is aware not only that Merry Brandybuck is riding with one of his riders, but also that the rider [[Dernhelm]] is Lady Éowyn herself. After she refused to stay behind in [[Dunharrow]], Elfhelm kept her secret and gave her the sword of her cousin Théodred that he took from the Fords. It was that very sword that Éowyn used to slay the [[Witch-King]] of [[Angmar]], though it broke in doing the deed. Elfhelm is later present during the coronation of King Elessar.

'''2019:''' ''[[Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game|Middle-Earth Strategy Battle Game]]'':'''
:Elfhelm received rules and a model as part of the Gondor at War expansion to the Middle-Earth Strategy Battle Game, his rules focusing on his skill with a throwing spear.
