The '''Council of the Sceptre''' was the King's Council of [[Númenor]].

== History ==
The King's Council was comprised of the nobles and lords from each of the [[Númenor#Geography|six regions]] of [[Númenor]] who gathered to advise the [[King of Númenor|King]] on weighty matters of state. When the king proclaimed an [[King's Heir|heir]], they would become a member of the council so as to learn about the government of the land. In addition, the king has the ability to summon others to the council whenever a specific set of knowledge is needed. It was said that the [[Lord of Andúnië]] was the most prominent of the chief councillors of the kings.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}, Note 23</ref> In the early days of Númenor, the Councillors had no power save that of advice, but when the [[Shadow]] fell upon Númenor and the Kings clung to their lives even after their vigor of mind had left them, their power often passed to the members of the Council.
