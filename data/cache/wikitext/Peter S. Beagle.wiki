==Quotes==
{{quote|I did want to be involved in some sort of a Tolkien project and at that time it was the only game in town. The idea of doing it live 25 years ago was inconceivable|Peter S. Beagle on animation, ''[[Ringers: Lord of the Fans]]''}}
{{quote|As for [[Saul Zaentz]] and ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', I wrote and rewrote that script God knows how many times, eight or nine at least, for a consultant's fee with the understanding that when Part 2 came along I would be paid extra to compensate for the skimpy payment on Part 1. Well there never was a Part 2, and Saul Zaentz never felt morally obliged to live up to the promise he made.|Peter S. Beagle on Saul Zaentz, [http://tinyurl.com/55yemd Interview].}}
