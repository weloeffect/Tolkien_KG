'''Galador''' was the first [[Prince of Dol Amroth]].

==History==
According to legend, ''Galador'' was the son of [[Imrazôr]] [[the Númenórean]] and the Elf-maid [[Mithrellas]].<ref name="PM"/><ref name=Amroth/> The ancestors of the [[Princes of Dol Amroth]] were a family of the [[Faithful]] group of the [[Númenóreans]] who had left [[Númenor]] before its [[Downfall of Númenor|downfall]] and settled in the land of Belfalas with a stronghold upon a high promontory and had received the title "[[Prince]]" from [[Elendil]] with whom they were related. It is possible that this high promontory was named [[Dol Amroth]] after the drowning of [[Amroth]], the last [[King of Lórien]] who was lost in the sea trying to swim back to the shore of [[Belfalas]],<ref name=Amroth/> to remember Amroth.<ref name=UTNote>{{UT|8e}}, note 39</ref> ''Galador'' became known as the first [[Prince of Dol Amroth]].<ref name=PM/><ref name=Amroth/>

== Etymology ==
''Galador'' is probably a [[Sindarin]] name. Its meaning and components are not glossed, but it is perhaps a compound of ''[[galadh]]'' ("tree") and ''[[-dor]]'' ("lord", "king").<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-1232214213.html|articlename=S.
