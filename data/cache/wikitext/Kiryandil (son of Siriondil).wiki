'''Kiryandil''' was the father of [[Eärnil II]], according to a draft version of the ''[[Appendices]]''.<ref name=Man/>

In an early [[Manuscript A (The Southern Line)|manuscript]] of what would become the ''[[Appendix A]]'' of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Eärnil II was presented as the son of a man called Kiryandil, who was in turn the son of [[Siriondil (son of Calimmacil)|Siriondil]], son of [[Calimmacil|Kalimmakil]],<ref group=note>The forms ''Kalimmakil'' and ''Narmakil'' are earlier spellings of ''Calimmacil'' and ''Narmacil'', respectively.</ref> son of king [[Narmacil II|Narmakil II]].<ref name=Man>{{PM|Elendil}}, Commentary, ''The Southern Line of Gondor'', entry '''Eärnil II''', pp. 216-7</ref>

However, soon after, the character of Kiryandil disappeared completely, and Eärnil instead became the son of Siriondil, son of Kalimmakil, son of Narmakil II.<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, ''The Southern Line of Gondor: the Anárioni'', entry 32 '''Eärnil II''', p. 201</ref>

Ultimately, however, in the published version of the ''Appendix A'', the genealogy of Eärnil changed once again - there he is described as the son of Siriondil, son of Calimmacil, son of [[Arciryas]], a newly created character envisioned as the brother of king Narmacil II.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, p. 1050</ref>
