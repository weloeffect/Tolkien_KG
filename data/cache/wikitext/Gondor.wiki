'''Gondor''', or the '''South-kingdom''', was one of the two [[Kingdoms of the Dúnedain]] (the other being [[Arnor]] in the north) in the lands about the [[Mouths of Anduin]]. Initially the lesser of the [[Realms in Exile|Realms in-Exile]], Gondor survived to the end of the [[Third Age]], unlike [[Arnor]], and had an instrumental role in the [[War of the Ring]].

==History==
===Second Age===
====Foundation====
After the [[Downfall of Númenor]], the [[Exiles of Númenor]], led by [[Elendil]], established the [[Realms in Exile]] of [[Arnor]] and Gondor. Arriving at the [[Mouths of Anduin]], Elendil's sons, [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]], ascended the great river and founded the realm of Gondor.<ref name="rings">{{S|Rings}}</ref> 

In [[Númenor]]ean colonies and outposts, such as [[Belfalas]] and [[Pelargir]],<ref name="UTD">{{UT|Druedain}}</ref> there were many [[Faithful]], fully or partially of [[Númenórean]] blood, who descended from [[Númenor]] long before its [[Downfall of Numenor|Downfall]]. The colonists welcomed Elendil's sons and allied themselves with the founders of the [[Kingdoms of the Dúnedain]].<ref name="rings" /><ref name="languages">{{App|Men}}</ref> Elendil made the Faithful nobles (kin of Elendil) who ruled Belfalas "[[Princes of Dol Amroth|Princes]]".<ref name="Cirion">{{UT|Cirion}}</ref> There were also many men of mingled blood, descended from the [[Men of the Mountains|Men of]] the [[White Mountains]] during the [[Dark Years]].<ref name="Minas Tirith">{{RK|V1}}</ref> 

[[Image:Ted Nasmith - The White Tree.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''The White Tree'']]

At this early point in its history, Gondor was the lesser of the Kingdoms of the Dúnedain, with their conjoint [[King of Gondor|Kings]] subject to the [[High King (Dúnedain)|High King]] who ruled [[Arnor]] in the North. After their arrival and acceptance by the people, [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]] put themselves to the task of ordering their realm. Isildur took the area then known as [[Arnen]] (later [[Ithilien]])<ref>{{VT|42a}}, p. 17</ref> and built the tower of [[Minas Ithil]] near Mordor as a threat to the [[Mordor|Black Land]], and within its walls he planted a seedling of the [[Nimloth of Númenor|White Tree]] of [[Númenor]] that he had taken before its burning. [[Anárion]] raised the tower of [[Minas Anor]] on the other side of [[Anduin]]'s floodplain as a bulwark against the [[Wild Men]]. In between their cities, the brothers founded [[Osgiliath]], their capital, from which they jointly reigned; these three cities also housed three of the [[palantíri]], the Seeing Stones that the [[Faithful]] had taken with them from [[Númenor]], to maintain contact with [[Elendil]] and the other areas under their control.

Extraordinary knowledge of stonework was brought to the South-kingdom from [[Númenor]], and this skill was a vital part of the character of Gondor and its people. In the early years of the realm, the [[Gondorians]] worked to erect mighty cities and monuments throughout their new land.<ref name="rings" /> Their original capital at [[Osgiliath]] had great stone bridges spanned the [[Anduin]], as well as mighty houses and towers of stone.<ref name="rings" /> Other works marvellous and strong they built in the land in the days of their power, at the [[Argonath]], and at [[Aglarond]], and at [[Erech]]; and at [[Isengard]], they made the [[Orthanc|Pinnacle of Orthanc]] of unbreakable stone.<ref name="rings" /> Great roads that ran both north and south of the [[White Mountains]] traversed through the realm.<ref name="RotR" />

Gondor was, from the beginnning of its history, always more powerful and populous than its northern counterpart, [[Arnor]], in spite of its borders being impeded in the South and East.<ref name="Atani">{{PM|Atani}}</ref>

====War of the Last Alliance====
{{main|War of the Last Alliance}}
Gondor was at first unaware that [[Sauron]], who had been taken as a prisoner to [[Númenor]] before its destruction, had survived the disastrous [[Downfall of Númenor|Downfall]]. However, not long after the kingdom's cities were built, the awakening of the fires of [[Orodruin]] signalled his return. At that time, the [[Men of Gondor]] first called the mountain ''[[Amon Amarth]]'', or [[Mount Doom]].<ref>{{App|Numenor}}</ref>

Soon after, in {{SA|3429}}, [[Sauron]] launched an [[First Fall of Minas Ithil|attack on Minas Ithil]], which forced [[Isildur]] into a retreat. Sauron took the fortress and burned the [[White Tree of Gondor]] that had grown there, but Isildur saved one of its seedlings and took it and his family on a ship down the [[Anduin]]. He sailed to the north to confer with [[Elendil]] about these events while [[Anárion]] remained in Gondor and continued to hold [[Minas Anor]] and [[Osgiliath]].<ref>{{App|B1}}</ref> He also managed to push back [[Sauron]]'s forces to the mountain range of [[Ephel Dúath]], but Sauron began to gather reinforcements and the [[Men of Gondor]] knew that their realm was in great danger of being destroyed unless aid came.

[[Elendil]] reacted to the threat of Sauron by combining forces with [[Gil-galad]], the [[High King of the Noldor]], to make the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]]. Their armies marched south-east from [[Arnor]] and [[Lindon]]. Supported by the forces of Gondor, [[Lórinand]], the [[Woodland Realm]], and [[Khazad-dûm]], the [[Last Alliance|Alliance]] fought a great battle on the plain of [[Dagorlad]], north of [[Mordor]]. The [[Last Alliance]] was victorious, and entered [[Mordor]] itself, where they laid a siege on Sauron's Tower of [[Siege of Barad-dûr|Barad-dûr]] for seven years. During this time, [[Anárion]], joint [[King of Gondor]], was killed by a rock thrown from [[Barad-dûr]] that broke his helm. The siege ended when [[Sauron]] himself emerged from [[Barad-dûr]] to fight the [[Last Alliance|Alliance]]. [[Gil-galad]] and [[Elendil]] were slain in single combat, but [[Isildur]] cut the [[One Ring]] from Sauron's finger ending the war.<ref name="rings" />

===Third Age===
====Independence====
After the battle, [[Isildur]], former joint [[King of Gondor]] and heir to the [[High King (Dúnedain)|High Kingship]],  built a secret tomb for [[Elendil]] on the mountain [[Amon Anwar]]<ref name="Cirion" /> and placed the rule of Gondor in the hands of his brother's eldest eligible son, [[Meneldil]]. Isildur planted the seedling of the White Tree that he had saved in [[Minas Ithil]], and brought to Minas Anor, and it endured for several centuries. 

After these acts, Isildur left Gondor in {{TA|2}} with the intent of taking up the [[High King (Dúnedain)|High Kingship]] in [[Annúminas]]. He [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields|never arrived]].<ref name="rings" /><ref name="AppB2" /> [[Isildur]] had relinquished the rule of Gondor to his nephew [[Meneldil]] who became the first [[King of Gondor]] to rule in his own right and so, Gondor became an independent realm.<ref name="rings" /><ref name="AppB2" />

====Golden Age====
After the war, Gondor's power and wealth grew steadily (only interrupted by an [[Easterlings|Easterling]] invasion in {{TA|492}}). Its power would continue to grow into the 9th century of the [[Third Age]].  While the power of Gondor's sister kingdom [[Arnor]] peaked during the 9th century, when it broke into various successor states, Gondor's greatest glory was yet to come.
[[File:Steven White Jr. - Gondor TA1050.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gondor in {{TA|1050}}]]
Gondor's power reached its Golden Age under the four "[[Ship-kings]]": [[Tarannon Falastur]], [[Eärnil I]], [[Ciryandil]], and [[Hyarmendacil I]].

Tarannon was [[Captain of the Hosts]] and the first of the [[Ship-kings]] of Gondor, who extended Gondor far along the shores west and south of the [[Ethir Anduin]]. Commemorating his victories, Tarannon assumed the name "Falastur" when he took the crown.<ref name="AppGondor">{{App|Gondor}}</ref> Tarannon was also famous for his Queen, the "nefarious, solitary, and loveless" [[Berúthiel]].  Tarannon had built a house in [[Pelargir]] that rested upon arches sunk into the [[Anduin]], but the queen refused to live within the sound and smell of the sea.  She lived in the King's House in [[Osgiliath]] where she owned cats said to be able to spy upon men. Eventually Tarannon placed her upon a boat cast adrift at sea.<ref>{{UT|Istari}}, Note 7</ref>  He was then the first king to die without an heir, and was succeeded by his nephew, the second of the Ship-kings, [[Eärnil I]].<ref name="South" />

[[Eärnil I]] continued with the expansionist maritime policy of his predecessor by constructing a great navy and repairing the ancient haven of [[Pelargir]].<ref name="Elendil" /> But Gondor was not the supreme "Lord of the Coasts" as Tarannon boasted; the [[Haven of Umbar]] stood in their way of complete domination.  So in {{TA|933}}, [[Eärnil I]] defeated the forces of Umbar, seizing control of the seas and making Umbar a great harbour and fortress of Gondor. Even though Gondor's naval power was uncontested, [[Eärnil I]] was lost at sea and was never seen again. 

When he was lost at sea, he was succeeded by his son [[Ciryandil]], who continued his father's naval policies of building more ships. Ciryandil reigned over Gondor for seventy-nine years, and died in the defence of Umbar against the Haradrim, in Haradwaith, led by the lords exiled from Umbar.

When Ciryandil was slain, his son Ciryaher took up the Crown. After biding his time and building up his forces, he avenged his father, and defeated the kings of Harad, by land and by sea and   made  them   acknowledge  the   overlordship of Gondor in {{TA|1050}}. After this victory he took the name ''Hyarmendacil'', meaning "South-victor". In the reign of the powerful king Hyarmendacil I Gondor reached the height of its power. Hyarmendacil's reign brought Gondor to its greatest extent and power. For the rest of his one hundred and thirty-four year reign Gondor was at peace; the passes of [[Mordor]] were well guarded, and no one dared contest his power. During Hyarmendacil I's reign, Gondor's borders reached their furthest extent. The Kingdom extended east to the [[Sea of Rhûn]]; south to the [[Harnen]] and all the coast up to the cape of [[Umbar]]; as far north as [[Celebrant]]; and west towards [[Greyflood]]. Gondor would also enjoy several centuries of peace due to its military might. The [[Men of the Vales of Anduin]] as well as the Haradrim acknowledged its authority and overlordship, with the Kings of Harad paying homage.<ref name="AppGondor" /> Hyarmendacil I was the last of the [[Ship-kings]]. He was succeeded by his lazy son [[Atanatar II|Atanatar II Alcarin]].

====Decline====
The extent and power of the realm Atanatar had inherited earned him the title [[Alcarin]] ("Glorious") but he did little to maintain its strength, and nothing to expand its influence. Already during Atanatar's reign, then, Gondor began to stagnate. There is some evidence to suggest that [[Gandalf]] first visited Gondor during this period, earning the name ''[[Incánus]]'' from the [[Gondorians]]. Atanatar II ruled Gondor for seventy-seven years, during which the wealth and power created by his father slowly began to wane. Atanatar was succeeded by his eldest son, who ruled as [[Narmacil I]], but [[Narmacil]] had no children and was succeeded in turn by his brother, Atanatar's younger son [[Calmacil]].

After sixty-four years as [[Regent of Gondor|Regent]] under the old King [[Calmacil]], [[Minalcar]] took the throne in his own right. In memory of a great victory over the [[Easterlings]] he had won in his [[Regent of Gondor|Regency]], he became King in the name [[Rómendacil II]]. [[Rómendacil II]] built, on the northern approach to [[Nen Hithoel]], the giant pillars [[Argonath]] to mark the northern border of Gondor following his great victory over the [[Easterlings]] in {{TA|1248}}.<ref name="AppB2">{{App|B2}}</ref> He developed less tangible defences, too, working to cement a bond between Gondor and the [[Northmen]] who lived to the east. He went so far as to send his son [[Valacar]] to live among them, an act from which the evils of the [[Kin-strife]] would eventually develop. After Rómendacil II's reign, decadence spread under the kings of Gondor and a long period of decline began (although Gondor experienced several revivals). Three great calamities struck Gondor during the second millennium of the Third Age, which are held to be the chief reasons for its decline:  the [[Kin-strife]], the [[Great Plague]], and the invasion of the [[Wainriders]] (a tribe of Easterlings), one of series of conflicts in the [[Wainrider/Balchoth War]].  

=====Kin-strife=====
{{main|Kin-strife}}
In the 15th century a great civil war named the Kin-strife tore the nation apart.  The current King Eldacar was of mixed blood: his mother was of the Northmen.  Popular displeasure at this led to the overthrow of King Eldacar by Castamir, the admiral of all of Gondor's naval forces who possessed some royal blood. Eldacar's son was slain, and Eldacar fled north.  Castamir was afterwards known as [[Castamir|Castamir the Usurper]].  During his ten year rule he proved to be very cruel, and because of his love of his old fleet, he lavished attention on the coastal regions while the interior provinces were ignored and left to rot.  Eldacar then returned with an army of his Northmen kinsmen, and they were joined by armies of Gondorians from interior provinces such as Anórien.  [[Osgiliath]] was devastated during this conflict, its great bridge destroyed and its ''[[palantíri|palantír]]'' lost. Eldacar slew Castamir and reclaimed his throne, but Castamir's sons and their forces were besieged in Pelargir, the great port of Gondor.  They eventually retreated to Umbar, where they joined with the Corsairs, and troubled Gondor for many years, until their descendants died out.

=====Great Plague=====
{{main|Great Plague}}
In [[Third Age 1636]], the [[Great Plague]] struck and the [[White Tree of Gondor|White Tree]] died. This Plague was no localized event:  the Plague swept through all of Middle-earth, reaching the successor states of Arnor and the [[Hobbits]] of [[the Shire]] in the North. King [[Tarondor (King of Gondor)|Tarondor]] found a sapling of the White Tree, and moved the capital from Osgiliath to [[Minas Anor]], the City of Anárion. During this time, Gondor was so depopulated that the fortifications guarding against the re-entry of evil into Mordor were abandoned.  They were slow to recover; but their weakness was not tested for a long time. No doubt the people further east had been equally afflicted, so that the enemies of Gondor came chiefly from the south or over sea.<ref name="Cirion">{{UT|Cirion}}</ref>

=====Invasion of the Wainriders=====
The first invasion of the Wainriders began {{TA|1856}} during the reign of King [[Narmacil II]], following the sapping of Gondor's strength by the plague.  The spirit of Sauron in the East stirred up the forces of the Wainriders to attack the lands of Gondor and her allies. The Wainriders were stronger than any other horde of Easterlings before, and so in 1856, on the fields of Rhovanion, the Wainriders defeated the forces of Gondor and the Northmen, killing [[Narmacil II]] and enslaving Rhovanion.  During the enslavement of Rhovannion, the Nazgûl entered Mordor.  But the Gondorians would not sit idle, while their allies to the north were suffering under the Wainriders.  In 1899 King Calimehtar led a revolt in Rhovanion, and defeated the Wainriders in the Battle of Dagorlad.  

{{TA|1940}} The King [[Ondoher]] took council with [[Araphant]] the king of [[Arthedain]]. The kings realized that one force was beset on destroying the kingdoms of the [[Dunedain]].  For a long time it had lain dormant, but in the weakness of both kingdoms, it attacked.  The Kingdoms allied against the power, and Prince [[Arvedui]] of Arthedain married Firiel the daughter of Ondoher.  

After licking their wounds for 45 years the Wainriders returned with allies from Khand and Harad in {{TA|1944}}. The Wainriders came in the north from Rhovanion and the men of Harad and Khand attacked from the South.  The Wainriders destroyed the Northern Army of Gondor, but in the south Gondor defeated the Southrons at the River Poros.  Their Captain Eärnil gathered the remnants of the northern army, and went north to challenge the Wainriders. In the [[Battle of the Camp]] Eärnil surprised the Wainriders, while they were celebrating their victory.

=====Reunification Rejected=====
In 1944, Gondor also faced a constitutional crisis when King [[Ondoher]] was slain in a previous battle with both his sons. Prince [[Arvedui]], son of King [[Araphant]] of [[Arthedain]] and Ondoher's son-in-law, and the victorious general Eärnil, who was a distant blood-relative of Ondoher, claimed the throne. Arvedui's claim lay mainly in the reintroduction of the old Númenórean law of accession, which stated the eldest (remaining) child should succeed the king. If the law was reintroduced, then Arvedui's wife [[Fíriel]], Ondoher's daughter and last remaining child would become [[Ruling Queens of Númenor|Ruling Queen]], making their descendants Kings of both Arnor and Gondor. Arvedui also tried to put weight behind his claim as he was Isildur's heir. The Council of Gondor recognised that the name of Isildur was held in honour in Gondor, but they dictated that the South-Kingdom must be ruled by an Heir of Anárion. Due to his ancestry from Fíriel and Arvedui, more than a millennium later, Aragorn Elessar put forward his claim as the heir of both Isildur and Anárion.

Eärnil lay his claim as being a direct descendant of King [[Telumehtar]] Umbardacil. His claim was also greatly bolstered by the popularity he had gained as the victorious general who saved Gondor from the Wainriders after winning the southern theatre of the war. Steward [[Pelendur]] who was temporarily ruling Gondor as serving as arbiter of succession, intervened in favour of Gondor's victorious general who would rule as [[Eärnil II]].

=====Last Heir of Anárion=====
During the [[Battle of Fornost]], Eärnil II's heir Eärnur led Gondor's forces to victory over the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]], who was actually the Lord of the [[Nazgûl]].  Although Eärnur wished to fight him, Eärnur's horse was terrified and fled the battle against his wishes.  By the time he mastered his horse and return, the Witch-king had fled.  [[Glorfindel]] the Elf then prophesied to him that it was better that he not fight the Lord of the Nazgûl because "never by the hand of man shall he fall".  

Eärnur later ascended to the throne, ruling from Minas Anor (Tower of the Sun).  During this time, the Ringwraiths [[Second Fall of Minas Ithil|captured]] Minas Anor's sister city, Minas Ithil (Tower of the Moon), causing it to be renamed Minas Morgul (Tower of Sorcery), and took it as their lair.  Minas Anor was renamed Minas Tirith (Tower of Guard) as a result.  The Lord of the Nazgûl repeatedly sent messengers to Minas Tirith challenging Eärnur to single combat, taunting him that he had fled out of cowardice from facing him during the Battle of Fornost.  Eventually, King Eärnur was overcome by wrath and rode with a small company of knights to Minas Morgul, to accept the challenge.  They were never heard from again.  So ended the Line of [[Anárion]].

====Ruling Stewards of Gondor====
{{main|Ruling Stewards}}
The realm was governed by a long line of hereditary Stewards after the disappearance of [[Eärnur]], son of Eärnil, since there was no proof that the last king was dead, and no claimant had enough support to be accepted as his successor. The line of Anárion was held to have failed, and Gondor was not willing to risk to another Kin-strife, which would surely have destroyed it. Whenever there was a new Steward, he would swear an oath to yield rule of Gondor back to the King, in essence only an heir of Isildur, if he should ever return. In Gondor there was no one who could claim descent from Isildur in direct line, and the northern line of Arnor had effectively disappeared, so this oath was not considered seriously. The line of Stewards ruled as Kings, without having the title.

=====Cirion and Eorl=====
[[File:Anke Eißmann - The oath of Cirion and Eorl.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''The oath of Cirion and Eorl'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]
In [[Third Age 2510]], when Steward [[Cirion]] ruled over Gondor, the nation faced one of its greatest perils: an Easterling tribe named the ''[[Balchoth]]'' invaded Gondor with massive force. Gondor's army marched to fight the Balchoth but were cut off from [[Minas Tirith]] and pushed back in the direction of the [[Limlight]].

Messengers were sent to get help from the [[Éothéod]], a tribe which lived in the northern vales of the [[Anduin]], but nobody expected the messengers to reach their destination. When certain peril came upon Gondor, however, the Éothéod turned the tide of the [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant]]. After the victory the Éothéod were awarded the fields of [[Calenardhon]] north of the [[Ered Nimrais]] from the Gap of Rohan at the southern end of the [[Misty Mountains|Hithaeglir]], [[Fangorn Forest]], rivers Limlight to river [[Anduin]], western [[Emyn Muil]] and the [[Mering Stream]], where they established the kingdom of [[Rohan]] with [[Eorl the Young]] as their first king. A perpetual alliance between Gondor and Rohan was established by the oath Eorl swore to Cirion.<ref name="Cirion" />

In {{TA|2710}} King [[Déor]] asked the help of [[Egalmoth (Steward of Gondor)|Steward Egalmoth]] to drive off the [[Dunlendings]] from the occupied [[Ring of Isengard]], but a renewed war against the Orcs prevented the Steward from fulfilling the Oath.<ref name="Elendil">{{PM|Elendil}}</ref><ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref>

Southern Gondor was assailed by three great fleets from Umbar and Harad and [[Beren (Steward of Gondor)|Steward Beren]] spent much of his rule fighting the [[Corsairs of Umbar]]. In the meantime, during the [[Long Winter]] of {{TA|2758}} - {{TA|2759|n}}, Rohan came under attack from the Dunlendings, so neither nation could help the other, until captain Beregond, Beren's son, repeled the invaders. Therefore when [[Saruman]] suddenly appeared and requested leave to dwell in [[Isengard]], Beren gladly gave the [[Wizard]] the [[key of Orthanc]]. By the time of Beregond, Gondor started recovering its strength.<ref name="Stewards">{{App|Stewards}}</ref>

Upon the death of [[Belecthor II|Belecthor]], the [[White Tree of Gondor]] also died, but was left standing "until the King comes".<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 206</ref>

In {{TA|2885}}, when Ithilien was invaded in great strength, King [[Folcwine]] of Rohan fulfilled the Oath and sent many men to Gondor. With their aid Steward [[Túrin II]] won a victory at the [[Crossings of Poros]]. Since then, Gondor withdrew from Ithilien and only the [[Rangers of Ithilien]] remained with special refuges for them, and a fortification on Cair Andros.<ref name="AppGondor" />

It was near the end of [[Turgon (Steward of Gondor)|Turgon]]'s rule, in  {{TA|2951}}, when [[Sauron]] declared himself openly in [[Mordor]]; he gathered his power there, and began rebuilding [[Barad-dûr]].<ref name="AppB2" /> [[Ecthelion II]] strengthened [[Pelargir]] and refortified [[Cair Andros]].<ref name="Elendil" /> Under his service, the stranger [[Thorongil]], severely damaged the Corsairs' fleet at Umbar in a [[Surprise Attack on Umbar|surprise attack]].<ref name="Stewards" />

=====War of the Ring=====
{{main|War of the Ring}}
[[File:Steven White Jr. - Gondor TA3019.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gondor in {{TA|3019}}]]
In 3019, during the [[War of the Ring]], Gondor was the strongest of the free nations that opposed Sauron, and thus, its defeat was his primary strategic goal in the war.<ref name="Minas Tirith">{{RK|V1}}</ref>  Gondor faced an all out attack on its capital Minas Tirith in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. Although nearly defeated, the Rohirrim once again turned the tide of battle, and helped win the war, though with heavy losses.<ref name="tBotPF">{{RK|Battle}}</ref> The combined army of the West then carried the battle to Sauron at the Battle of the Morannon, a feint to distract Sauron's attention from Frodo Baggins's quest to destroy the One Ring in Mount Doom, thus causing Sauron's destruction and the allies' ultimate victory.

===Later history===
{{main|Reunited Kingdom}}
After the second and final defeat of Sauron, the [[King of Gondor|Kingship of Gondor]] was restored, [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]] became the third [[King of Gondor and Arnor]]. 

During his reign, [[Aragorn]] restored Gondor and repeopled it, but retained [[Minas Tirith]] as the chief city.<ref name="Elendil">{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> He, alongside [[King of Rohan|King]] [[Éomer]], led military campaigns beyond the [[Sea of Rhûn]] and on the far fields of the [[South]].<ref name="Appendix A">{{App|Mark}}</ref> As a result, he was able to re-establish his dominance in places which Gondor initially held at the height of its power. The threat of the [[Corsairs of Umbar|Corsairs]] was finally completely subdued during his reign and [[Umbar]] was finally re-taken.<ref name="AppGondor" /> He also made peace with the [[Haradrim]] after his coronation.<ref name="RK-StewardKing">{{RK|VI5}}</ref>

===Politics===
Gondor was divided into regions described as 'fiefs', each under the control of a lord who in turn owed their allegiance to the Ruler of Gondor, whether the [[King of Gondor|King]] or (in later years) the [[Ruling Steward]].<ref name="Fortyone">{{PM|Languages}}, §41, p. 45</ref> Many of these fiefs were dominated by the [[Dúnedain]], notably the royal lands of [[Anórien]] and [[Ithilien]], as well as the shoreland fief of [[Belfalas]].<ref name="languages" />

The [[Númenórean]] [[King of Gondor]] governed the realm with the frame of ancient law, of which he was administrator (and interpreter) but not the maker. In all debatable matters of importance domestic, or external, however, even [[Denethor II|Denethor]] had a [[Council of Gondor|Council]], and at least listened to what the Lords of the Fiefs and the Captains of the Forces had to say. [[Aragorn]] re-established the [[Council of Gondor|Great Council of Gondor]], and in that [[Faramir]], who remained by inheritance the [[Steward]] (or representative of the King during his absence abroad, or sickness, or between his death and the accession of his heir) was his chief counsellor.<ref name="politics">{{L|244}}</ref>

==Geography==
At its greatest extent, the realm extended:<ref name="AppGondor" />

*North to the [[Field of Celebrant]] and the southern eaves of [[Mirkwood]]<ref name="AppGondor" />
*West to the [[Greyflood]]<ref name="AppGondor" />
*East to the inland [[Sea of Rhûn]]<ref name="AppGondor" />
*South to the [[River Harnen]], and also along the coast to the peninsula and haven of [[Umbar]]<ref name="AppGondor" />

[[Calenardhon|A large part of the northern territories]] was gifted to the [[Éothéod]] in {{TA|2510}}.<ref name="Cirion">{{UT|Cirion}}</ref> Gondor's close proximity to Sauron's land was the catalyst of many battles and skirmishes, but its location also gave the Gondorians more ability to protect the other regions of Middle-earth from the Dark Lord and his servants.<ref name="CoE">{{FR|Council}}</ref>

At the height  of its  power, between  the reigns of  [[Hyarmendacil I]]  and [[Rómendacil II]] ({{TA|1015}}-{{TA|1366|n}}), the wide lands between [[Anduin]] and  the  [[Sea of Rhûn]]  were  never  effectively  settled  or  occupied,  and  the  only  true north  boundary of the  Kingdom  east  of  [[Anduin]]  was  formed  by   the  [[Emyn Muil]]  and the   marshes   south   and   east   of   them.<ref name="Atani" /> Númenorean influence, however,   went  far   beyond  even   these  extended   bounds,  passing up  the  [[Vales of Anduin]]  to  its  sources,  and  reaching  the lands east  of  [[Mirkwood]],  between  the  [[River Running]] and the [[River Carnen]].<ref name="Atani" />

===Regions===
Gondor was divided between several nearly autonomous regions. These were the following:

*[[Andrast]], the de-populated peninsula of [[Ras Morthil]]
*[[Anfalas]], or the Langstrand, in the south-west
*[[Anórien]], surrounding [[Minas Tirith]] and north of Ered Nimrais
*[[Belfalas]], the peninsula jutting out from the southern coast of Gondor ruled by the [[Prince of Dol Amroth]]
*[[Ethir Anduin]], the estuary of the [[Anduin|River Anduin]]
*[[Ithilien]], the lands across the [[Anduin]] from Minas Tirith
*[[Lamedon]], north of the [[Ringló]]
*[[Lebennin]], the land between Lossarnach and the Bay of Belfalas
*[[Lossarnach]], in the mountain vales south-west of Minas Tirith
*[[Morthond]], south of Erech
*[[Pinnath Gelin]], the hills north of Anfalas and east of the river Lefnui
*[[Ringló Vale]], between Lamedon and [[Belfalas]]

Additionally, Gondor held or had held the following regions at certain points in its history:
*[[South Gondor]], which was contested between Gondor and the forces of [[Harad]] and [[Umbar]]
*[[Calenardhon]], which was given to the Éothéod and became Rohan
*[[Enedwaith]], the timberlands of Gondor (shared with [[Arnor]]), which were never really populated and soon abandoned
*[[Rhovanion]], which was never fully under the control of Gondor but under Gondorian influence at certain times during the Third Age
*[[Haradwaith]], tributary of Gondor for a while

===Cities===
Cities in Gondor included:
*[[Calembel]]
*[[Dol Amroth]], the seat of [[Prince of Dol Amroth|Princes]] on the coasts of Gondor
*[[Linhir]]
*[[Minas Tirith]] (originally named [[Minas Anor]]), the seven-tiered citadel of the [[Kings of Gondor]]
*[[Minas Ithil]], conquered by the [[Ringwraiths]] and renamed [[Minas Morgul]] by the [[Gondorians]]
*[[Osgiliath]], the ancient capital of Gondor
*[[Pelargir]], the greatest and most ancient of the havens of Gondor
*[[Tarnost]] (debatable)<ref name="t2M">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]], ''[[The War of the Ring]]'', "[[The Second Map]]"</ref>

===Fortresses and outposts===
Additionally, Gondor used the following locations as military strongholds at certain points in its history, many of which Mordor later took:
*The outposts of [[Amon Hen]] and [[Amon Lhaw]] on [[Emyn Muil]] probably had small garrisons
*[[Isengard|Angrenost]], the fortress of Isengard, later granted to [[Saruman]]
*The Gondorian fortress later known as [[Hornburg]], guarding the [[Helm's Deep]]
*The [[Towers of the Teeth]], built by the Gondorians to keep watch over Mordor.
*The [[Tower of Cirith Ungol|fortress]] guarding the pass of [[Cirith Ungol]]
*The castle that came to be called [[Durthang]], the largest fortress in Mordor, originally built to guard the [[Ephel Dúath]]
*[[Tharbad]] to the north, held by both Gondor and Arnor but abandoned and later ruined after Gondor retreated from [[Enedwaith]]
*[[Umbar]], which was contested between Gondor and the forces of [[Harad]] and [[Umbar]]

==Languages==
[[Westron]], or the Common Speech, was the main language of the people of Gondor. An antique, more formal and terse, form of the Common Tongue was spoken by the Gondorians.<ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref> 

Many of the Men of Gondor could also speak the [[Elvish]] tongues, a notable distinction and characteristic among the [[Dúnedain of the South]].<ref name="languages" /> [[Sindarin]] had long ceased to be a "first language" in Gondor, but was learned in early youth (by those claiming [[Númenórean]] descent) from loremasters, and used by them as a mark of rank and high-blood.<ref name="Elendil" /> It had changed very little since the [[Downfall of Númenor]] and though the [[Men of Gondor]] altered some of the sounds, they could still understand the [[Elves]] and be understood by them.<ref name="Elendil" /> [[Westron]] became used more and more by the [[Dúnedain of Gondor]] themselves, so that at the time of the [[War of the Ring]], [[Sindarin]] was known to only a small part of the peoples of Gondor (and spoken daily by fewer); they dwelt mostly in [[Minas Tirith]] and the adjacent townlands, and in the land of the tributary princes of [[Dol Amroth]].<ref name="languages" /> [[Sindarin]] was used to be polite, especially in [[Minas Tirith]].<ref name="quenya">{{L|347}}</ref>

[[Quenya]] was known to the learned of Gondor, a tradition which has continued from the loremasters of [[Númenor]], to be used for places of fame and reverence in addition to the names of royalty and men of great renown.<ref name="languages" /><ref name="quenya" /> All the royal names of the [[Kings of Gondor]] as well as all the [[Stewards]] until [[Mardil Voronwë]] were [[Quenya]] names.<ref name="languages" /><ref name="South">{{App|South}}</ref> At the end of the [[Third Age]], there were more [[Gondorians]] (those of [[Minas Tirith]] and its fiefs) that knew [[Quenya]] or spoke [[Sindarin]] than there were [[Elves]] (those of [[Lindon]], [[Rivendell]], and [[Lórien]]) who did either.<ref name="quenya" /> 

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Gondor.mp3|Ardamir}}
The name '''''Gondor''''' was likely adopted from the lesser people's terminology<ref name="L324">{{L|324}}</ref> and translates from [[Sindarin]] as "Stone-land", from the words ''[[gond]]'' ("stone") + ''(n)[[dor]]'' ("land").<ref name="L324" /> Gondor received its name because of the abundance of stone in the [[Ered Nimrais]], and the usage of it in great stone cities, statues, and monuments, such as Minas Tirith and the Argonath. 

==Other names==
Its [[Quenya]] name was '''''Ondonórë'''''.<ref name="PE17">{{PE|17}}, entry S '''Gondor''', p. 28</ref><ref name="VT42">{{VT|42}}, entry ''Belfalas'', p. 27</ref> 

In earlier times, it was called the ''Hyaralondië'' (''Hyallondië'') or in full ''Turmen Hyallondiéva'' in Quenya, and ''Arthor na Challonnas'' ("Realm of the South-harbourage") in Sindarin: the elements ''[[londië]]'' and ''[[lonnas]]'' mean "harbour, landing".<ref name="PE17" />

Gondor was also referred to as the Kingdom of the South,<ref>{{UT|Eorl}}</ref><ref>{{UT|Tradition}}</ref> the South Kingdom,<ref name="rings" /><ref>{{FR|Council}}, p. 252</ref><ref>{{UT|11c}}</ref> South-kingdom<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Eärnil II, p. 1050</ref><ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2, p. 1085</ref><ref>{{RK|Muster}}, p. 803</ref><ref>{{RK|Battle}}, p. 849</ref> or the Southern Realm.<ref>{{UT|Amroth}}</ref>

In [[Rohan]], it was known as '''Stoningland''' (a modernization of [[Old English]] ''Stāning-(land)''<ref>{{HM|N}}, entry '''Stoningland''', p. 776</ref>),<ref name="tBotPF" /> and [[Ghân-buri-Ghân]] of the [[Drúedain]] also recognized their use of stone.<ref name="RotR">{{RK|Ride}}</ref>

==Inspiration==
The history and civilization of Gondor has been compared to historical elements of the real world. Many real-world civilizations experienced periods in which a regent, vizier, or or general held actual power in the name a rightful monarch, like the Ruling Stewards did in Gondor. In his letters Tolkien compared the Ruling Stewards of Gondor to the Carolingians of France—Charlemagne's line descended from a marshal in service to the Merovingian dynasty that eventually replaced them.
===Italy===
[[Letter to Jennifer Brookes-Smith (28 July 1955)|Writing in a letter]] about an impending trip in [[1955]], Tolkien identified Gondor as [[Wikipedia:Italy|Italy]].<ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 462</ref>
===Egypt===
[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote in a [[Letter 211|letter]] that the Númenóreans of Gondor resembled Egyptians in many ways, including their love of, and ability to construct, the gigantic and massive, and in their interest in ancestry and tombs. He also thought that the [[Crown of Gondor]] was very tall and similar to the [[Wikipedia:Pschent|crown of the Pharaohs of Egypt]], but with attached wings that were set back at an angle.<ref>{{L|211}}, p. 281</ref> [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] pointed out that the [[Argonath]], two gigantic statues of [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]], recall ancient Egyptian statues, like the [[Wikipedia:Colossi of Memnon|two gigantic statues of Memnon]] at the [[Wikipedia:Mortuary Temple of Amenhotep III|Mortuary Temple of Amenophis III]].<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 347</ref> They also referred to this letter in a [[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion|comment]] concerning [[Faramir]]'s statement that "Kings made tombs more splendid than houses of the living".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 477</ref> Notably, some "scholars" claimed that ancient Egypt was a colony of [[Wikipedia:Atlantis|Atlantis]],<ref>[[Wikipedia:Ignatius L. Donnelly|Ignatius L. Donnelly]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4032 Atlantis: The Antediluvian World] (1882), Part V, Chapter II: The Egyptian Colony</ref> much like how Gondor was a survival of Númenor (although it is unknown if Tolkien considered this aspect).

===Byzantine Empire===
The subdivision of the Númenórean realms in exile into a northwestern kingdom of Arnor and a southeastern kingdom of Gondor resembles the subdivision of the Roman Empire into the Western Roman Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire). Like Gondor survived Arnor and its successor kingdoms, the Byzantine Empire long survived the fall of the Western Roman Empire and had periods of glory. Like the kin-strife in Gondor there were civil-wars among the members of the ruling families in the Byzantine Empire.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 689</ref>

[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] stated in a long [[letter to Milton Waldman]] that was probably written in late 1951, in which he summarized the story of ''The Silmarillion'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', that in the Third Age Gondor rises to a peak and then "fades slowly to decayed Middle-Age, a kind of proud, venerable, but increasingly impotent Byzantium"<ref>{{L|131}}</ref> and that the story in Book Five reaches the "half-ruinous Byzantine City of Minas Tirith"<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 746</ref>. Some of the parallels noted between Gondor and the Byzantine Empire are:<ref>Miryam Librán-Moreno, "'Byzantium, New Rome!': Goths, Langobards, and Byzantium in ''The Lord of the Rings''", in ''[[Tolkien and the Study of His Sources]]'' (edited by [[Jason Fisher]]</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=Tom Simon|articleurl=https://bondwine.com/2010/03/13/gondor-byzantium-and-feudalism/|articlename=Gondor, Byzantium, and feudalism|dated=13 March 2010|website=[http://www.bondwine.com/ Bondwine]|accessed=26 November 2024}}</ref>

Gondor is the south-eastern portion of [[Elendil]]'s original kingdom. The Byzantine Empire was the eastern remnant of the Roman Empire. The [[Wikipedia:Western Roman Empire|Western Roman Empire]] eventually withered and dissolved, like [[Arnor]], while the Byzantine Empire endured, although in a dramatically weakened state. Both states acted as a cultural and military buffer between two cultures: Byzantium between Europe and Islam, Gondor between the northern polities and Mordor. The Byzantine Empire absorbed several "barbaric" peoples like the Wends and Slavs, much like Gondor did with the [[Northmen]] and other [[Middle Men]]. Unlike Byzantium, Gondor did not fall and was restored through the return of its rightful line of kings. Constantinople and Minas Tirith also play similar roles as the respective largest cities in their respective cultural spheres.

As a final note, the last Byzantine Emperor, [[Wikipedia:Constantine XI Palaiologos#Legacy|Constantine XI]], remained in legend and folklore as the [[Wikipedia:King in the mountain|"Marble Emperor"]] whose messianic ressurection and return would signal the restoration of the Empire. This parallels the fate of [[Earnur]] and Gondor's interregnum period until the "Return of the [[Aragorn|King]]" who [[Reunited Kingdom|restored the Kingdom]].
