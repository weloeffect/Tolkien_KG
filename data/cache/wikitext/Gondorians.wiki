The '''Gondorians''' were the inhabitants of [[Gondor]]. The '''Dúnedain of Gondor''', also known as the '''Dúnedain of the South''', constituted the ruling class and nobility of [[Gondor]] being descendants of the [[Exiles of Númenor]] who established the South-Kingdom. The history of the Gondorians is extensively dominated by the actions of the Dúnedain of the South.

==History==
===Early history===
In [[Númenor]]ean colonies and outposts, such as [[Belfalas]] and [[Pelargir]], there were many [[Faithful]], fully or partially of [[Númenórean]] blood, who descended from [[Númenor]].<ref name=rings/> The Númenóreans venturing north of Pelargir met Men who had already settled in valleys on either side of the [[White Mountains]], and classified them "[[Middle Men]]" due to their friendliness to the [[West]], and recognized as descendants of the Men who abjured the [[Shadow]].<ref name=atani>{{PM|Atani}}</ref> There were many men of mingled blood, descended from the [[Men of the Mountains|Men of]] the [[White Mountains]] during the [[Dark Years]].<ref name="Minas Tirith">{{RK|V1}}</ref> 
[[File:Anke Eißmann - Departure from Gondor.jpg|thumb|''Departure from Gondor'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]
After the [[Downfall of Númenor]], the [[Exiles of Númenor]], led by [[Elendil]], established the [[Realms in Exile]]. Arriving at the [[Mouths of Anduin]], Elendil's sons, [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]], ascended the great river and founded the realm of Gondor. The colonists welcomed them and allied themselves with the founders of the [[Kingdoms of the Dúnedain]].<ref name=rings>{{s|Rings}}</ref><ref name=languages>{{App|Men}}</ref> Elendil made the Faithful nobles of his kin who ruled Belfalas "[[Princes of Dol Amroth|Princes]]".<ref name="Cirion"/> Even the [[Pre-Númenóreans|non-Númenórean]] peoples, like the [[Men of the Mountains]], swore allegiance to Isildur.<ref>{{RK|V2}}</ref>

Originally ruled by their [[High King (Dúnedain)|High King]], the [[Dúnedain]] were divided as the [[Dúnedain of Arnor]] and the [[Dúnedain of the South|Dúnedain of Gondor]], following [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields|the death of Isildur]] ({{TA|2}}). Isildur had relinquished the rule of Gondor to his nephew [[Meneldil]] who became the first [[King of Gondor]] to rule in his own right, and so the Gondorians became an independent people.<ref name=rings/><ref name="AppB">{{App|B2}}</ref>

The Men of Gondor were, from the beginning of their history, always more powerful and populous than their northern counterparts, the [[Men of Arnor]], in spite of their borders being impeded in the South and East.<ref name=atani/>

===Third Age===
As the realm endured, the splendour of the Gondorians grew, until during the reign of [[Hyarmendacil I]] ({{TA|1050}}) it recalled the wealth and majesty of [[Númenor]].<ref name=gondor>{{App|Gondor}}</ref><ref name="AppB"/> They built high towers, strong places, and havens of many ships; and many different peoples bowed to the [[Crown of Gondor]].<ref name=rings/>
[[File:John Howe - The Watchful Peace.jpg|thumb|''The Watchful Peace'' by [[John Howe]]]]
In the later [[Third Age]], the Gondorian blood became much mingled with that of other men, especially the [[Northmen]] of [[Rhovanion]]. King [[Eldacar (King of Gondor)|Eldacar]], who himself had Northmannish blood, showed favour to the Northmen who supported him. The [[Kin-strife]] led to the loss of many Dúnedain. After his return from exile, many noble houses, including the royal [[House of Anárion]], became more mingled with the blood of [[Middle Men|"lesser" Men]].<ref name=gondor/>

The [[Great Plague]] decimated the Gondorians with many, including King [[Telemnar]] and his kin.<ref name=gondor/><ref name=rings/> 

After the reign of King [[Eärnur]], royal descendants among the Dúnedain of Gondor had become few and no claimant for the throne could be found of pure Númenórean blood, or whose claim all would accept, and people were afraid of a new Kin-strife that would devastate the kingdom. Thus, by default, [[Mardil]] began the line of [[Ruling Stewards of Gondor]].<ref name=gondor/><ref name=rings/>

During the rule of the [[Stewards]], the remaining Dúnedain of Gondor still defended the passage of the [[Anduin]] against the terrors of [[Minas Morgul]] and against all the enemies of the West.<ref name=rings/>

By the time of the [[War of the Ring]], most Dúnedain of Gondor lived within [[Minas Tirith]] and in the townlands of the [[Pelennor]]. Many Dúnedain also lived in the royal lands of [[Anórien]], [[Ithilien]], and [[Belfalas]], and others the southern fiefs, in the high vales of the mountain-borders, in [[Lossarnach]], or further south in [[Lebennin]].<ref name="Minas Tirith"/><ref name=languages/><ref name="Language">{{PM|Languages}}</ref>

===Later history===
Upon the reunification of the [[Kingdoms of the Dúnedain]] after the [[War of the Ring]], the Dúnedain were [[Reunited Kingdom|reunited]] under [[Aragorn II Elessar]], [[Isildur's Heir]], and their glory was restored.<ref name=rings/>

==Characteristics==
===Appearance and Traits===
The Gondorians of [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] descent were tall, pale-skinned, with dark hair, shining grey eyes, and proud faces.<ref name="Minas Tirith"/><ref name="Herbs">{{TT|Herbs}}</ref> They were a proud and noble people, valiant in the face of hardship.<ref name="Minas Tirith"/> The Men of [[Gondor]] whose blood is more mingled with the people of the [[White Mountains]] (such as those of [[Lossarnach]]) were grim-faced, shorter, and somewhat swarthier than many others in [[Gondor]].<ref name="Minas Tirith"/>

===Lifespan===
In the beginning of their history, the Dúnedain were blessed with a lifespan thrice the life of [[Middle Men|lesser men]], yet this ever-diminished over the course of the [[Third Age]].<ref name=languages/><ref name=eriador>{{App|Eriador}}</ref> After Gondor's numbers were replenished by lesser [[Northmen]] after the [[Kin-Strife]], the mingling did not at first hasten the waning of the Dúnedain, as had been feared, but it still proceeded little by little as it had before.<ref name=gondor/> 

After the fall of the [[Kings of Gondor|Kings]], the waning was much swifter in [[Gondor]] than in [[Arnor]].<ref name=eriador/> In fact, [[Hador (Steward of Gondor)|Hador]] the seventh [[Ruling Steward]] of [[Gondor]] was the last Gondorian to live 150 years and after his time the life-span of those with [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] blood waned more rapidly.<ref name="Elendil">{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> By the time of the [[War of the Ring]], the lifespan of the Dúnedain of Gondor had waned to little greater than that of lesser men.<ref name=Healing/> Only few among the Gondorians passed 100 years with vigour, except in the more pure and noble houses.<ref name=Healing/>

Upon the reunification of the [[Two Kingdoms]], the life-span of all [[Dúnedain]] (including those of Gondor) was not restored and continued to wane until it became as that of other men.<ref name="Elendil"/>

==Culture==
===Skills===
The original Gondorians brought extraordinary knowledge of stonework with them from [[Númenor]], and this skill was a vital part of the character of [[Gondor]] and its people. In the early years of the realm, the Gondorians worked to erect mighty cities and monuments throughout their new land. Their original capital at [[Osgiliath]] had great stone bridges spanned the [[Anduin]], as well as mighty houses and towers of stone. Other works marvellous and strong they built in the land in the days of their power, at the [[Argonath]], and at [[Aglarond]], and at [[Erech]]; and at [[Isengard]], they made the [[Orthanc|Pinnacle of Orthanc]] of unbreakable stone.<ref name=rings/> They also built great roads that ran both north and south of the [[White Mountains]].<ref>{{RK|Ride}}</ref>

The Gondorians were very skilled in the arts of healing and medicine, having preserved much wisdom of [[Númenor]].<ref name="Cirion"/> They were skilled in healing all such sickness [[Men]] were subject to.<ref name=Healing>{{RK|Houses}}</ref>

The Men of [[Gondor]] were noted for their great seafaring skills, especially naval warfare. They  built navies and extended the sway of Gondor along the coasts west and south of the [[Mouths of Anduin]] for more than a thousand years.<ref name=gondor/><ref name=rings/>

===Customs===
The Dúnedain of the South married late in their life and had few children. Several of the [[Kings of Gondor]] were childless.<ref name=gondor/>

Before a meal, the Gondorians had a little ritual called the [[Standing Silence]]:  they looked towards the [[West]] in silence, towards [[Númenor]], and beyond to [[Aman]], and to that which is beyond Elvenhome.<ref>{{TT|Window}}</ref>

Gondorian ships were usually black and silver in colour.<ref>{{webcite|author=Daniel Helen|articleurl=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/2015/11/tolkiens-annotated-map-of-middle-earth-transcribed/|articlename=Tolkien’s annotated map of Middle-earth transcribed|dated=10 November 2015|website=The Tolkien Society|accessed=5 August 2018}}</ref>

The people of [[Minas Tirith]] used horses very little and they were rarely seen in their streets, save only those ridden by the errand-riders of their lord.<ref name="Minas Tirith"/>

===Language===
[[Westron]], or the Common Speech, was the main language of the people of [[Gondor]]. An antique, more formal and terse, form of the Common Tongue was spoken by the Gondorians.<ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref> 

Many of the Men of Gondor could also speak the [[Elvish]] tongues, a notable distinction and characteristic among the [[Dúnedain of the South]].<ref name=languages/> [[Sindarin]] had long ceased to be a "first language" in [[Gondor]], but was learned in early youth (by those claiming [[Númenórean]] descent) from loremasters, and used by them as a mark of rank and high-blood.<ref name="Elendil"/> It had changed very little since the [[Downfall of Númenor]] and though the Men of [[Gondor]] altered some of the sounds, they could still understand the [[Elves]] and be understood by them.<ref name="Elendil"/> [[Westron]] became used more and more by the Dúnedain of Gondor themselves, so that at the time of the [[War of the Ring]], [[Sindarin]] was known to only a small part of the peoples of Gondor (and spoken daily by fewer); they dwelt mostly in [[Minas Tirith]] and the adjacent townlands, and in the land of the tributary princes of [[Dol Amroth]].<ref name=languages/> [[Sindarin]] was used to be polite, especially in [[Minas Tirith]].<ref name="quenya">{{L|347}}</ref>

[[Quenya]] was known to the learned of [[Gondor]], a tradition which has continued from the loremasters of [[Númenor]], to be used for places of fame and reverence in addition to the names of royalty and men of great renown.<ref name=languages/><ref name="quenya"/> All the royal names of the [[Kings of Gondor]] as well as all the [[Stewards]] until [[Mardil Voronwë]] were [[Quenya]] names.<ref name=languages/><ref>{{App|South}}</ref> At the end of the [[Third Age]], there were more [[Men]] (those of [[Minas Tirith]] and its fiefs) that knew [[Quenya]] or spoke [[Sindarin]] than there were [[Elves]] (those of [[Lindon]], [[Rivendell]], and [[Lórien]]) who did either.<ref name="quenya"/>
