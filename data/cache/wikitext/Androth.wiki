'''Androth''' ([[Sindarin]], from ''[[and]]'' = "long" and ''[[roth]]'' = "cave") was the name of a complex of caves in the [[Mithrim|Mountains of Mithrim]]. After the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]] ("Battle of Unnumbered Tears"), [[Annael]] led some of the [[Sindar]] and [[Edain]] that survived the battle to the caves and took refuge there. [[Tuor]] was fostered by the [[Elves]] of Androth until they left for the [[Havens of Sirion]] in {{FA|488}}. Later he returned to lie there as an outlaw.<ref>{{UT|Tuor}}</ref>
