'''Gram''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2668|n}} – {{TA|2741|n}}, aged 73 years) was the eighth [[King of Rohan]]. 

==History==
Gram was the son of [[Déor]] and father of [[Helm|Helm Hammerhand]] and [[Hild]]. His reign was a time of warfare with the [[Dunlendings]], who had occupied [[Isengard]] during his father's time, and continued to raid and harass the [[Rohirrim]].<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] comments that the name in [[Old Norse]] has the meaning "warrior" or "king", which is not the case with recorded [[Old English]]. However he presupposes some poetic influence of [[Northern Mannish]] upon [[Rohanese]] (similar to the influence between Old Norse and Old English), after which the name can be understood as such.<ref>{{L|297|112}}</ref> ''Gram'' means "furious" or "fierce" in Old English.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 643</ref><ref>{{webcite|website=[http://www.bosworthtoller.com/ Bosworth-Toller Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]|articleurl=https://bosworthtoller.com/17448|articlename=gram|accessed=24 July 2025}}</ref>
