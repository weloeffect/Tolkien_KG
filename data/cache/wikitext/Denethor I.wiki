'''Denethor I''' ([[Third Age]] 2375<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, manuscript C, The Ruling Stewards of Gondor, entry 10. Denethor I, p. 204</ref> – 2477,<ref name=Denethor>{{App|South}}, ''Ruling Stewards'', entry for Denethor I, p. 1039</ref> aged 102 years) was the tenth [[Ruling Steward]] of [[Gondor]] and ruled from from {{TA|2435}}<ref name=Dior>{{App|South}}, ''Ruling Stewards'', entry for Dior, p. 1039</ref> until his death in {{TA|2477|n}}.

==History==
Denethor was probably named after [[Denethor (Nando)|the leader]] of the [[Laiquendi]] in the [[First Age]], as it was customary in the [[House of Húrin]] to name sons after figures from the legends of the [[Noldor]] and their interactions with the [[Edain]].<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, manuscript C, The Ruling Stewards of Gondor, p. 203</ref>

During the time of Denethor’s rule the [[Watchful Peace]] came to an end (in {{TA|2460}}) when [[Sauron]] returned with increased strength to [[Dol Guldur]].<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2460, p. 1087</ref> In the last years of his rule the ''Uruks'', black Orcs with great strength, came from [[Mordor]] for the first time and assailed and overran [[Ithilien]] and captured [[Osgiliath]] in {{TA|2475}}. Denethor’s son, [[Boromir (Steward of Gondor)|Boromir]], defeated the invaders and reconquered Ithilien, but Osigiliath was left in ruins and its great stone-bridge over the river [[Anduin]] was broken and Osgiliath was abandoned by its population.<ref name=AppADenethor>{{App|Stewards}}, entry for Steward Denethor I, p. 1053</ref>

The [[Rammas Echor]] was built with a great amount of labour after the province of [[Ithilien]] fell under the shadow of the Enemy<ref>{{RK|MT}}, p. 750</ref> during the rule of Steward Denethor,<ref name=UI>{{HM|UI}}, entry ''Rammas Echor,'' p. 512</ref> but it is not specified if it was during the rule of Steward Denethor I or Steward [[Denethor|Denethor II]]. It is possible that Denethor I had the [[Rammas Echor]] constructed after the capture of Osgiliath, to protect the [[Pelennor Fields]] which fed [[Minas Tirith]], because the borders of Gondor were under constant threat from his rule on.<ref name=AppADenethor/>

Denethor I ruled as Steward for forty-two years,<ref name=Denethor/><ref name=Dior/> and was succeeded by his son Boromir.<ref name=AppADenethor/>

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Denethor.mp3|Ardamir}}
For the meaning of his name refer to [[Denethor (king of the Laiquendi)#Etymology|Denethor - Etymology]]. It is possible that Denethor I was named after the [[Nandor|Nando]] chieftain of the [[Green-elves|Laiquendi]] of the [[First Age]].<ref>{{NM|P2v}}, footnote 3, p. 189</ref>
