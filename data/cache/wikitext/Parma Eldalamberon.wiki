'''''Parma Eldalamberon''''', '''''Parma''''', or '''''PE''''' for short, is a linguistic journal dedicated to the scholarly study of the invented languages of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. It was first published by the [[Mythopoeic Society]], then by the [[Elvish Linguistic Fellowship]] since issue 6.

The name ''Parma Eldalamberon'' is a [[Neo-Quenya]] rendering of '''"The Book of Elven-tongues"''', which is consist of ''[[parma]]'' ("book"), ''[[elda]]'' ("Elf"), and ''[[lambë]]'' ("tongue, language"). However, like with ''Vinyar Tengwar'', the rendering is questionable as ''[[Parma Eldalamberon 18|PE 18]]'' gives the genitive plural of ''lambë'' as ''lambion''<ref>{{PE|18}}, pp. 8, 71</ref> instead of ''lamberon''.

==History==
''Parma Eldalamberon'' was started in [[1971]], as an irregular periodical published by the Mythopoeic Linguistic Fellowship (M.L.F.) of the [[Mythopoeic Society]]. The first editor was [[Paula Marmor]]. It ran for five issues, ending in [[1977]], but resulted in the landmark book ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]''. Of that book Paula Marmor was co-author, several other co-authors, [[Bill Welden]], [[Christopher Gilson]], [[Lawrence J. Krieg]], and editor [[Jim Allan]], were regular contributors to ''Parma'' and parts of it had grown from their articles in the journal. The publication of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', and ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'' made most of the discussions outdated, however, and the project was shelved.

Another regular contributor was [[Robert Foster]], who had already published his ''Guide to Middle-earth'', which he revised and extended to ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'' after the publication of ''The Silmarillion''.

Six years later, in [[1983]], Chris Gilson revived ''Parma''. He kept the original name, despite the fact that the increase in Quenya material gave the correct translation as ''Parma Eldalambion''. Gilson published ''Parma'' outside the Linguistic Fellowship,<ref>[[David Doughan]], "Book Reviews: Parma Eldalamberon 6", in: [[Quettar]] 21 ([[November]] [[1984]]), p. 8</ref> but after the [[Elvish Linguistic Fellowship]] (E.L.F.) was founded it became associated with that organisation.

In [[1991]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] approved of ''Parma'' publishing original text by Tolkien, especially the long linguistic texts for which he could find no place in ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]''.<ref>[[Christopher Gilson]], "Foreword", in: [[Parma Eldalamberon 11|''Parma Eldalamberon'' 11]] ([[1995]]), p. 2</ref>

In the meantime, ''[[Vinyar Tengwar]]'' also started publishing Tolkien's original texts. Now, they are both edited by more or less the same team, and ''Parma'' specializes in the longer wordlists, while ''Vinyar Tengwar'' publishes Tolkien's essays.<ref>[[David Bratman]], "Posthumous Publications", in: ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia]]'' (edited by [[Michael D.C. Drout]]), p. 547-8</ref>
