'''War of the Ring: The Card Game''' is an re-imagined, streamlined and condensed version of the [[War of the Ring: Second Edition (2011 board game)|larger board game of the same name]].
==From the publisher==
Inspired by the best-selling and award-winning War of the Ring board game, War of the Ring - The Card Game allows players to journey to the world of J.R.R. Tolkien’s [[The Lord of the Rings]] and create their own version of the dramatic conflict between the Dark Lord, [[Sauron]], and the [[Free Peoples]] of Middle-earth.

In War of the Ring - The Card Game, up to 4 players compete in two teams, the Shadow against the Free Peoples, each player using a specific and different card deck representing the strengths and weaknesses of the different factions involved in the war.

The Free Peoples desperately try to complete their quest to destroy the [[One Ring]], while at the same time defending their homelands from the encroaching hordes of Sauron and from his evil allies. The Shadow players must strike quickly and decisively, before the [[Ring-bearers]] can complete their quest; or try to slowly corrupt [[Frodo]], burdening him with wounds, toil, and the sorrow for the loss of his Companions.
