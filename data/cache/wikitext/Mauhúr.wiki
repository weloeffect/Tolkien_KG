'''Mauhúr''' was an [[Orcs|Orc]] in the service of [[Saruman]].

== History ==
Mauhúr was sent to reinforce [[Uglúk]]'s troop as they returned to [[Isengard]] with [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]]. He found them surrounded by [[Éomer]]'s [[Rohirrim]] at the edge of [[Fangorn Forest]], from which he led his Orcs in an attack. This attack was a failure: the Rohirrim were able to defeat the Orcs, even with Mauhúr's reinforcements. It is unknown whether Mauhúr and his soldiers were "''killed or driven off''" by the Rohirrim.<ref>{{TT|III3}}</ref>

'''1995-8: ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]'':'''
:Mauhúr can be played as Unique Leader, and his home site is Dol Guldur.

'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''
:Mauhúr is portrayed as an [[Uruk-hai]] instead of an Orc, and is played by [[Robbie Magasiva]] and voiced by [[Andy Serkis]]. His remarks on the lack of food enticed [[Snaga (orc of Isengard)|Snaga]], who proposed eating the captives. Mauhúr was among the Uruks who devoured Snaga's corpse after the latter was beheaded for his limited discipline.

'''[[2012]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Mauhúr leads a group of Uruks that split off from [[Uglúk]]'s band and establish a camp called Kufuzg in the Norcrofts of [[Rohan]], where he is found and defeated by the player.
