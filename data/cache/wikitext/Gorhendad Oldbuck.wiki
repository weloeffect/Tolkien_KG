'''Gorhendad Oldbuck''' was a [[Hobbit]] of [[the Shire]], the founder of [[Buckland]] and of the [[Brandybuck Family|Brandybuck]] family.

==History==
Gorhendad Oldbuck of the [[Marish]] crossed the [[Brandywine]] in {{TA|2340}}<ref name="TA2340">{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2340, p. 1087</ref> ({{SR|740}}<ref>{{App|Brandybuck}}</ref>) and founded [[Buckland]] and constructed [[Brandy Hall]].<ref name="Conspiracy">{{FR|Conspiracy}}, p. 98</ref> In honour of their new land, he changed his family name from Oldbuck ([[Hobbitish|H.]] ''[[Zaragamba]]''<ref name="Translation">{{App|Translation}}, p. 1138</ref>) to [[Brandybuck Family|Brandybuck]] (H. ''[[Brandagamba]]''<ref name="Translation" />).<ref name="Conspiracy" /> He ruled the land as [[Master of Buckland]]<ref name="Translation" /> and Master of the Hall, virtually a small independent country.<ref name="Conspiracy" /> After his death, the head of the Brandybuck family became the Master of Buckland<ref>{{App|Later}}, entry for the year 1432, p. 1097</ref> and Master of the Hall.<ref name="Conspiracy" /> When he and his family moved from [[the Shire]] to Buckland,<ref name="TA2340" /> the office of [[Thain]] passed from the Oldbuck family to the [[Took Family]]<ref>{{FR|Ordering}}, p. 9</ref> and [[Isumbras Took I]] became the first [[Thain]] of the Tooks<ref name="TA2340" />.

==Etymology==
''Gorhendad'' is the translation of [[Westron]] ''Ogmandab''.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, note 8</ref>. According to Stoor tradition, it used to mean "great-grandfather" or "ancestor".<ref name="granddad">{{PM|Languages}}, typescript F 4, text 'A' of the second section</ref>

In an earlier manuscript version the Westron name was ''Ogforgad''.<ref name="granddad" />

J.R.R. Tolkien mentioned that he gave the name ''Gorhendad'' a "Celtic cast" and that the relation of Welsh or British to English was somewhat similar to the relation of the older language of the Stoors and Bree-men to Westron.<ref name="granddad" /> He stated that ''Gorhendad'' is a "Welsh word meaning 'great-grandfather'".<ref>{{HM|N}}, entry '''Oldbuck''', p. 761</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 115</ref><ref>[[Mark T. Hooker]], ''[[A Tolkienian Mathomium]]'', p. 10</ref>
