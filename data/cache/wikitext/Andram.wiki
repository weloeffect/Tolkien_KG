'''Andram''' ([[Sindarin|S]]. 'long wall'; [[and]] = long, [[ram]] = wall) was a "dividing fall"<ref>{{S|14}}</ref> that ran across [[Beleriand]] west to east, from beyond [[Nargothrond]] to the [[Gates of Sirion]] and ending at [[Ramdal]], being three leagues in width from north to south.<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, p. 262</ref>  The wall was pierced in two places: the gorge of Nargothrond, through which flowed the River [[Narog]], and where the River [[Sirion]] ran underground from its falls south of the [[Aelin-uial]] to its reappearance at the [[Gates of Sirion]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>

Its easternmost hill was [[Amon Ereb]], which usually was not considered a part of Andram (indeed ''Ramdal'' meant "Wall's End").<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

On [[the Second 'Silmarillion' Map]], Andram is depicted as a long chain of hills, from the Falls of Sirion in the west to Rhamdal in the east, with a bend (not appearing in the [[Map of Beleriand and the Lands to the North]]) in the middle. These hills are barely visible on the original map because they are drawn in pencil, but they appear very clearly on the map drawn by Christopher Tolkien<ref>{{WJ|11}}, Sheet 4 - South-east, p.185</ref>.
