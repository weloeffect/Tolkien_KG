'''Arassuil''' ({{TA|2719}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 196</ref> - {{TA|2784|n}},<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 156) was the eleventh [[Chieftain of the Dúnedain]], succeeding his father, [[Arahad II]], when he died in 2719.

==History==
During his chieftainship the [[Orcs]] of the [[Misty Mountains]] became more bold, daring to invade [[Eriador]]. The [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]] fought many battles trying to hold them back,<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref> but one party of [[Orcs]] managed to reach [[the Shire]], where they were fought off by a party of brave [[Hobbits]] under [[Bandobras Took|Bandobras "Bullroarer" Took]] in {{TA|2747|n}} at the [[Battle of Greenfields]].<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref>

Also during this time, in {{TA|2758|n}}, the [[Long Winter]] arrived. Many lives were lost, and [[Gandalf]] and the [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]] had to help the [[Hobbits]] of [[the Shire]] survive.<ref name="TA"/>

After having been chieftain for 65 years, Arassuil died in 2784. He was succeeded by his son, [[Arathorn I]].<ref name="North"/>

==Etymology==
''Arassuil'' is a [[Sindarin]] name. Its meaning is not glossed, but Paul Strack suggests that the initial element of the name is the prefix ''[[ara|ar(a)-]]'' ("noble", "royal", "high"). The meaning of the second element is unclear.<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-461119701.html|articlename=S. ''Arassuil'' m.|website=Eldamo|accessed=05 February 2022}}</ref> It could be ''suil'' ("greeting") from ''suila'' ("to greet").
