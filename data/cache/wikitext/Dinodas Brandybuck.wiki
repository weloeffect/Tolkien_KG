==History==

==Etymology==
The meaning of the name ''Dinodas'' is unknown. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] noted that the names of the Bucklanders had a vaguely [[Celtic]] style.<ref name="Translation">{{App|Translation}}, p. 1135</ref>

[[Jim Allan]] suggests that the name ''Dinodas'' is a rearrangement of the name ''[[Dodinas Brandybuck|Dodinas]]''.<ref>{{HM|IE}}, "Giving of Names", "The Celtic-sounding Names", p. 202</ref>

''Dodynas'' and ''Dinodes'' are both alternate spellings of the Table Knight Sir Dodinas le Savage.<ref>Christopher W. Bruce (ed.), ''The Arthurian Name Dictionary'', entry for ''Dodinel'',p. 148</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In earlier versions of the family tree of the Brandybuck family he was called ''Priamus''.<ref>{{PM|Trees}}, Brandybuck of Buckland, manuscript BR 5</ref>
