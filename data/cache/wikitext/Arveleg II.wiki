'''Arveleg''' ({{TA|1633}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 194</ref> - {{TA|1813|n}},<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 180) was the twelfth king of [[Arthedain]].

==History==
Arveleg came to throne upon the death of his father, [[Arvegil]], in {{TA|1743}}. He ruled for seventy years, apparently in an uneventful period as no noteworthy events are recorded during his reign.

He died 180 years old and was succeeded by his son, [[Araval]].<ref name="North"/>

== Etymology ==
''Arveleg'' is a [[Sindarin]] name. Its meaning its not glossed, but the Association Tolkiendil suggests that ''Arveleg'' means "Mighty King" and is a combination of ''[[ara|ar(a)-]]'' ("royal", "noble", "high") and a [[lenition|lenited]] form ''veleg'' of ''[[beleg]]'' ("mighty", "great").<ref>{{webcite|author=Association Tolkiendil|articleurl=https://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/compound_sindarin_names|articlename=Compound Sindarin Names in Middle-earth|website=Tolkiendil|accessed=03 February 2022}}</ref> It is likely that he was named after his great-great-grandfather, [[Arveleg I]].
