==Lyrics==
<poem>
May it be an evening star
Shines down upon you
May it be when darkness falls
Your heart will be true
You walk a lonely road
Oh! How far you are from home

Mornië utúlië ([[Quenya]] for "Darkness has come" mornië=darkness, utúlië=has come) 
Believe and you will find your way
Mornië alantië (Quenya for "Darkness has fallen" mornië=darkness, alantië=has fallen)
A promise lives within you now

May it be the shadow's call
Will fly away
May it be you journey on
To light the day
When the night is overcome
You may rise to find the sun

Mornië utúlië (Quenya for "Darkness has come")
Believe and you will find your way
Mornië alantië (Quenya for "Darkness has fallen")
A promise lives within you now
A promise lives within you now 
</poem>
