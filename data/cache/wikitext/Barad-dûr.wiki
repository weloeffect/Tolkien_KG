'''Barad-dûr''', also known as the '''Dark Tower''', was the chief fortress of [[Sauron]], on the [[Plateau of Gorgoroth]] in [[Mordor]]. Known in [[Black Speech]] as '''''[[Barad-dûr#Etymology|Lugbúrz]]''''', the Eye of Sauron kept watch over [[Middle-earth]] from its highest tower.

==Description==
Barad-dûr was built upon the end of a long southwestern spur of the [[Ered Lithui]] in the northern part of the Plateau of Gorgoroth. It stood about 30 miles east of [[Mount Doom]] and about 100 miles southeast of the [[Black Gate]]. From Barad-dûr a road led northwest to the Black Gate.<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref> Another road, [[Sauron's Road]], led from Barad-dûr's huge western gate west to an entrance in the eastern mountain side of Mount Doom from which a tunnel led to the [[Cracks of Doom|Sammath Naur]].<ref name="Mount Doom">{{RK|Doom}}, p. 942</ref>

Barad-dûr was built upon a mighty mountain-throne above immeasurable pits.<ref name="Tower">{{RK|Doom}}, p. 946</ref> It was black and immeasurably strong with wall upon wall, battlement upon battlement<ref name="Breaking">{{FR|Breaking}}, p. 401</ref> and towers as tall as hills.<ref name="Tower" /> It had gaping gates of steel and adamant and contained great courts, dungeons and windowless prisons.<ref name="Tower" /> The topmost tower had an iron crown and contained<ref>{{HM|UI}}, entry ''Window of the Eye'', p. 615</ref> the [[Window of the Eye]] from which Sauron looked over the land.<ref name="Mount Doom" />

==History==
===First Building===
[[File:Alan Lee - The building of Barad-dur.jpg|thumb|left|''The building of Barad-dûr'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]
Around {{SA|1000}} Sauron chose Mordor as a land to turn it  into a stronghold and began to buid the Barad-dûr, because he was alerted by the growing power of the Númenóreans.<ref>{{App|SA}}, entry for the year c. 1000, p. 1083</ref> Around 600 years later he secretly forged the [[The One Ring|One Ring]] in the fires of [[Mount Doom]], completed the construction of Barad-dûr and strengthened its foundations with the power of the One Ring.<ref>{{App|SA}}, entry for the year c. 1600, p. 1083</ref>

During the following years Sauron was able to consolidate his power and extend it into the east.<ref name="Rings">{{S|Rings}}</ref> However, in {{SA|3261}}, [[Ar-Pharazôn]], king of [[Númenor]], landed at the [[Umbar|Haven of Umbar]] with a great host and marched north towards Mordor. Their splendour and might was so great that Sauron humbled himself before the king and came to Númenor as a hostage.<ref>{{App|SA}}, entry for the year 3261, p. 1084</ref>

The year after the [[Downfall of Númenor]] in {{SA|3319}} Sauron's spirit secretly returned to Barad-dûr.<ref>{{App|SA}}, entries for the years 3319 and 3320, p. 1084</ref> There he worked a terrible shape for himself, took up again the One Ring and prepared for war against the Eldar and the Exiles of Númenor, who had established their realms in [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]].<ref name="Rings" /> He succeeded in [[First Fall of Minas Ithil|taking]] [[Minas Ithil]], but in {{SA|3430}} [[Elendil]] and [[Gil-galad]] formed the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] and defeated Sauron four years later in the [[Battle of Dagorlad]]. After that they passed into Mordor and began the [[Siege of Barad-dûr]].<ref name="Rings" /><ref>{{App|SA}}, entries for the years 3430 and 3434, p. 1084</ref> The siege lasted for seven years, Gil-galad and Elendil were slain and in {{SA|3441}} Sauron was finally defeated.<ref name="Rings" /><ref>{{App|SA}}, entry for the year 3441, p. 1084</ref> [[Isildur]] son of Elendil cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand and took it for his own instead of destroying it. The Dark Tower was finally leveled but its foundations remained, because they had been strengthened with the power of the One Ring and could not be destroyed as long as that existed.<ref>{{FR|Council}}, p. 244</ref>

===Reconstruction===
[[File:John Howe - The Dark Tower 01.jpg|thumb|''The Dark Tower'' by [[John Howe]]]]
Around {{TA|1050}} Sauron had returned and secretly made a stronghold at [[Dol Guldur]].<ref>,{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1050, p. 1085</ref> [[Gandalf]] did not discover that Sauron was the master of Dol Guldur until he entered it in {{TA|2850}}, and in {{TA|2941}} the [[White Council]] decided to attack the fortress and Sauron, who had already made plans for an attack against Dol Guldur, abandoned it. The next year Sauron secretly returned to Mordor, which the [[Nazgûl]] had prepared for him, and began to rebuild Barad-dûr in {{TA|2951}}.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entries for the years 2942 and 2951, p. 1089</ref> After that Sauron stayed in Barad-dûr and conducted his war on the free people of Middle-Earth from there.

On [[25 March|March 25]], {{TA|3019}} the ring-bearer [[Frodo Baggins]] succeeded in destroying the One Ring, although it was the creature [[Gollum]] who actually held the Ring as it fell into the [[Cracks of Doom]]. With the Ring destroyed Barad-dûr ultimately collapsed to ruin and Sauron was finally defeated.<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019, March 25, p. 1094</ref>

{{blockquote|A brief vision he had of swirling cloud, and in the midst of it towers and battlements, tall as hills, founded upon a mighty mountain-throne above immeasurable pits; great courts and dungeons, eyeless prisons sheer as cliffs, and gaping gates of steel and adamant: and then all passed. Towers fell and mountains slid; walls crumbled and melted, crashing down; vast spires of smoke and spouting steams went billowing up, up, until they toppled like an overwhelming wave, and its wild crest curled and came foaming down upon the land. And then at last over the miles between there came a rumble, rising to a deafening crash and roar; the earth shook, the plain heaved and cracked, and Orodruin reeled.|Vision of [[Samwise Gamgee]] from the downfall of Barad-Dûr<ref name="Tower"/>}}

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Barad-dur.mp3|Ardamir}}
''Barad-dûr'' is a [[Sindarin]] name.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, citing from J.R.R. Tolkien's manuscript for the ''[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings|Nomenclature of The Lord of the Rings]]'', p. 274</ref> It means "Dark Tower".<ref>{{TT|Road}}, "Barad-dûr, the Dark Tower,", p. 555</ref> It is a compound of ''[[Barad]]'' (a great towering building, (fort, city, castle) tower)<ref name="PE17">{{PE|17}}, entry S '''Elbereth''', subentry Q ''Varda'', p. 22</ref> and the adjective ''[[dûr]]'' ("dark" (with evil implications")).<ref>{{PE|17}}, entry S '''mor''', p. 31</ref> 

''Lugbúrz'' was the name of Barad-dûr in the [[Black Speech]], composed of the Black Speech words ''lûg'' ("fortress", "lock-up", "prison") and ''[[búrz]]'' ("dark").<ref>{{TT|Flotsam}}, p. 564</ref><ref>{{PE|17}}, entry B '''Lugbúrz''', p. 79</ref>

The [[Quenya]] versions of ''Barad-dûr'' are ''Taras Lúna'' ("Dark Tower") and ''Lúnaturco'' ("Dark Stronghold").<ref name="PE17" /> They are never used within the narration.

'''1980: [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]:'''
:Barad-dûr is portrayed as a simple fortress. During a [[The One Ring|ring]]-induced dream, [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] dreams of taking the Ring and storming the Tower, but his common sense gains the upper hand in time.<ref>[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]], "Samwise the Strong"</ref>

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:Barad-dûr is one of the first sites visited. After the [[Witch-king]] captures [[Gollum]] snooping on the edge of Mordor, the [[Mouth of Sauron]] questions the creature in the Dark Tower.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]], "The Shadow of the Past"</ref>

'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''
:In the [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''Lord of the Rings'' movies]] by [[Peter Jackson]], [[Richard Taylor]] and his design team built a 9 foot high miniature ("[[Bigatures|big-ature]]") of Barad-dûr for use in the film.  Using the size scale for the model implemented for the films, the Dark Tower is  depicted as being over 1500 meters (5,000 feet) tall.
:''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' also shows Barad-dûr as clearly visible from the [[Black Gate]] of Mordor. Even granting its enormous size, it was located one hundred miles away and to the east of the Gate, and behind the inner mountain ridges of [[Udûn (valley)|Udûn]] so [[Aragorn]]'s army would probably not have been able to see it. In the film version, the geography of Mordor seems generally to have been compressed somewhat, perhaps for artistic reasons related to rendering such complex stories in a visual medium. In the case of the Black Gate scene, having Barad-dûr visible from the Gate means that the army can see the Eye of Sauron staring at them.

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:The Tower is briefly visible in the opening scene. [[Galadriel]] narrates a vision from her [[Mirror of Galadriel|Mirror]]. It is only referred to as "The Dark Tower of Mordor", and it is the base of the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]] (as opposed to [[Minas Morgul]]). The Eye of Sauron is portrayed as a fiery eye at the top, but is only visible for a split second.

'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'':'''
:Barad-dûr is shown in the introduction scene. It's design is similar to that of the tower in the movies. It does not play a role in any of the campaigns, and does not appear on any of the maps.

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:Like in its predecessor, the tower of Barad-dûr plays no active role in this game. In the "War of the Ring" mode, it can be seen in the territory of Mordor, but is absent on the map itself.

'''2017: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:With the destruction of the One Ring, the main tower of Barad-dûr had collapsed, but the foundations remain standing and teeming with Sauron's servants. The dungeons of Barad-dûr, the "Mordath", have been exposed to the sky above through the cracks in the earth.
