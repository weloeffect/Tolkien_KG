Old '''Pott''' was, according to [[Samwise Gamgee]]'s poem "[[Perry-the-Winkle]]", a [[Mayor of Michel Delving]]. He witnessed the meeting of [[Mrs. Bunce]] with the [[Lonely Troll]] and he was in turn frightened. When he learned that the Troll was kind and generous, he and other [[Hobbits]] tried to visit him. But the Troll refused those who had refused his friendship.<ref name="Perry"/>

It is unknown if this character was based on an actual person, or just an invention by the poet.<ref name="Perry">{{AB|Perry}}</ref>
