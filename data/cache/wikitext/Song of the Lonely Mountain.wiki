==Lyrics==
{{Blockquote|<poem>Far over the [[Misty Mountains]] rise
Leave us standing upon the heights
What was before, we see once more
Our [[Kingdom under the Mountain|kingdom]] a distant light

Fiery mountain beneath the [[moon]]
The words unspoken, we'll be there soon
For home a song that echoes on
And all who find us will know the tune

Some folk we never forget
Some kind we never forgive
Haven't seen the back of us yet
We'll fight as long as we live
All eyes on the hidden door
To the [[Lonely Mountain]] borne
We'll ride in the gathering storm
Until we get our long-forgotten gold

We lay under the Misty Mountains cold
In slumbers deep and dreams of gold
We must awake, our lives to make
And in the darkness a torch we hold

From long ago when lanterns burned
Till this day our hearts have yearned
Her fate unknown the [[Arkenstone]]
What was stolen must be returned

We must awake and make the day
To find a song for heart and soul

Some folk we never forget
Some kind we never forgive
Haven't seen the end of it yet
We'll fight as long as we live
All eyes on the hidden door
To the Lonely Mountain borne
We'll ride in the gathering storm
Until we get our long-forgotten gold
Far away from Misty Mountains cold</poem>|''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack - Special Edition|An Unexpected Journey - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack - Special Edition]]'' booklet}}
