'''Ioreth''' was a woman of [[Gondor]] during the [[War of the Ring]]. 

==History==
Ioreth was originally from [[Imloth Melui]] in [[Lossarnach]], but moved to [[Minas Tirith]] and worked in the [[Houses of Healing]]. By {{TA|3019}} she was the oldest woman working there and was well versed in old lore. Upon seeing the illness-stricken [[Faramir]], she said that she wished there was still a king in Gondor, remarking "For it is said in old lore: ''The hands of the king are the hands of a healer''." [[Gandalf]] heard this, and brought [[Aragorn]] to the Houses of Healing, where he was able to heal many of the sick. Ioreth was very talkative, which annoyed Aragorn and Gandalf.<ref>{{RK|Houses}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Ioreth'' means "old woman" in [[Sindarin]]; ''[[iaur]]'' ("old") plus feminine ending ''[[-eth]]''. In draft, Tolkien had spelt her name ''Yoreth''.<ref name=Joukes>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], "[[Letter to Mr Joukes|Letter to a Mr. Joukes dated August 28, 1967]]", published in [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', p. 579</ref>

Like "[[Gamling]]", it was specifically chosen to suit the character of the old nurse.<ref name=Joukes/>
