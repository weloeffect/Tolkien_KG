The '''song of the Mounds of Mundburg''' was a song written by an unnamed poet of [[Rohan]] some years after the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].  It was about those slain in the battle, those buried at the [[Mounds of Mundburg]].<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref> Like most of the poems attributed to the Rohirrim, it is written in the old Germanic alliterative meter. It is much like the epic [[Welsh]] poem ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_Gododdin Y Gododdin]'' in miniature form.

==Poem excerpt==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
We heard of the horns in the hills ringing,
the swords shining in the [[Gondor|South-kingdom]],
Steeds went striding to the [[Stoningland]]
as wind in the morning. War was kindled.
There [[Théoden]] fell, Thengling mighty,
to his [[Meduseld|golden halls]] and [[the Mark|green pastures]]
in the [[Rohan|Northern fields]] never returning,
high lord of the host.</poem>
