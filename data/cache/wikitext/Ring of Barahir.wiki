The '''Ring of Barahir''', originally the '''Ring of Felagund''', was an [[Elves|Elven]] artifact that was originally given by [[Finrod Felagund]] to [[Barahir]] and was kept by the [[Edain]] as an heirloom in the later [[Ages]].
==Description==
The ring had the shape of two serpents with emerald eyes, one devouring and the other supporting a crown of golden flowers, the emblem of the [[House of Finarfin]].<ref name=sberen/>
==History==
The Ring was fashioned in [[Valinor]] by the [[Noldor]], and was owned by the [[Elves|Elven]] Lord [[Finrod]]. He took it to [[Middle-earth]] during the [[Exile of the Noldor]], along with other treasures he brought from [[Tirion]],<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref> and wore it with him in [[Nargothrond]].

During the [[Dagor Bragollach]] the [[Adan]] [[Barahir]] saved his life, and Finrod gave him the ring as a token of eternal friendship between Finrod and the House of Barahir. 

Barahir wore the Ring for the rest of his life, until his hand, still wearing it, was taken by the leader of  the [[Orcs]] who [[Massacre at Tarn Aeluin|killed him]], as a proof of his feat. But [[Beren]] went through great perils to avenge his father and retrieved his hand. Beren laid the hand to rest with the rest of his father's remains, but kept and wore the Ring.<ref name=sberen>{{S|Beren}}</ref>

When Beren was assigned the [[Quest for the Silmaril]], he went to [[Nargothrond]] and used it as a token to seek Finrod's help. Finrod fulfilled his pledge and even found his death in the dungeons of [[Minas Tirith (Beleriand)|Minas Tirith]] in order to save Beren.

The Ring's fate in the following centuries is only vaguely recorded. Through [[Dior]], his daughter [[Elwing]] and her son [[Elros]], it found its way to [[Númenor]]. Apparently it remained an heirloom of the [[Kings of Númenor]], until King [[Tar-Elendil]] did not give it to his heir [[Tar-Meneldur]], but to his eldest daughter [[Silmariën]], who was not allowed to succeed him on the throne. She in turn gave the ring to her son [[Valandil (Lord of Andúnië)|Valandil]], first [[Lords of Andúnië|Lord of Andúnië]]. The Ring was handed down to the succeeding Lords of Andúnië until the last of the [[Faithful]]. Thus it survived the [[Downfall of Númenor]] when the [[Faithful]] escaped to [[Middle-earth]].<ref>{{UT|3a}}, Note 2</ref>

In the [[Third Age]], the ring was again passed in direct line from [[Elendil]], the last of the Lords of Andúnië, as an heirloom of the [[Kings of Arnor]], and then [[Kings of Arthedain]] until the [[Fall of Fornost|fall]] of [[Arthedain]]. 

The last King of Arthedain, [[Arvedui]], gave the ring to the chief of the [[Lossoth]] of [[Forochel]], thankful for the help he received from them. Years after {{TA|1975}}, it was ransomed from the Snowmen by the [[Rangers of the North]], and it was kept safe at [[Rivendell]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

Eventually, in {{TA|2952}}, it was given by [[Elrond]] to [[Aragorn]] son of [[Arathorn II|Arathorn]], when he was told of his true name and lineage, together with the shards of [[Narsil]]. In {{TA|2980}}, while in [[Lothlórien|Lórien]], Aragorn gave the ring to [[Arwen|Arwen Undómiel]], and thus they were betrothed.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>

Nothing is said of the fate of the ring in the [[Fourth Age]], but unless it went with Arwen to her grave at [[Cerin Amroth]], it most likely passed to the Kings of the [[Reunited Kingdom]], [[House of Telcontar|descendants]] of Aragorn and Arwen.

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In ''[[The Lay of Leithian]]'', the Ring belonged to [[Finrod#Other versions of the legendarium|Finrod]] (later Finarfin) and inherited by his son [[Inglor|Inglor Felagund]] (later Finrod). When Beren shows the Ring in [[Menegroth]], it is described as thus:
{{blockquote|Proud are the words, and all there turned<br>to see the jewels green that burned<br>in [[Beren]]'s ring. These [[Gnomes]] had set<br>as eyes of serpents twined that met<br>beneath a golden crown of flowers,<br>that one upholds and one devours:<br>the badge that [[Finrod]] made of yore<br>and [[Felagund]] his son now bore...|[[Lay of Leithian Canto IV|Canto IV]], vv. 1096-1103}}
