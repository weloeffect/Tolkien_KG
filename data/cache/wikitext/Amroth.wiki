'''Amroth''', was an [[Elves|Elf]], and king of [[Lórien]]. 

He was lost in the waters of the [[Bay of Belfalas]] when his ship, waiting for the arrival of his beloved [[Nimrodel]], was blown to sea by a great storm and he attempted to swim back in order to not be parted from her.<ref name=lorien>{{FR|II6}}</ref>

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Amroth was [[Sinda]], the son of [[Amdír]].<ref name=amroth>{{UT|Amroth}}</ref>

In {{SA|1697}}, after the fall of [[Eregion]] during the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]], Amroth led a force of Elves from [[Lórinand]], joined by [[Dwarves]] of [[Durin III|Durin]], against [[Sauron]]. Sauron's forces were engaged with those of [[Elrond]], and would have overwhelmed them, but the intervention of Amroth and Durin enabled Elrond to extricate himself and withdraw north. Sauron then turned upon the Elves of Lórinand and the Dwarves and drove them back, but did not pursue them as his more immediate purpose was to capture [[Lindon]], the capital of [[Gil-galad]], where he believed one or more of the [[Three Rings]] were kept. Eventually, with the arrival of the [[Númenóreans]] Sauron was beaten and retreated to [[Mordor]].<ref name=concerning>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>

Amroth became King of Lórien in {{SA|3434}} after Amdír was slain in the [[Battle of Dagorlad]].<ref name=amroth/>

Around {{TA|1050}}, the shadow started to grow in [[Mirkwood]].<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> The establishment of [[Dol Guldur]] especially caused Amroth to dwell in growing disquiet, and made his home in a high [[flet]] so that a watch over it might be kept.<ref name=amroth/> Galadriel too felt this foreboding and, with Celeborn, journeyed to Lórien and stayed there a long time with Amroth. He was valiant and wise, and his people were content with him, so after many long journeys of enquiry throughout [[Rhovanion]], Galadriel and Celeborn eventually returned west to dwell in [[Imladris]].<ref name=amroth /> 

Around {{TA|1409}}, Elves from Lórien passed over the [[Misty Mountains]] to join forces with the [[Elves of Rivendell]] under [[Elrond]] against [[Angmar]]; along with assistance from the [[Elves of Lindon]], they were successful in subduing the [[Witch-king]] and [[Angmar]] for some time.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain, entry for king Arveleg</ref>

=== With Nimrodel ===
For many years Amroth loved [[Nimrodel]], a [[Silvan]] Elf and for her he lived in their manner, housed in the tall trees of the great green mount of [[Cerin Amroth]]. Though she returned his love, she would not wed him. She regretted the coming of Elves from the West as she believed that they brought wars and destroyed the peace.<ref name=amroth/>

In {{TA|1981}} the [[Balrog]] emerged in [[Moria]], drove out the Dwarves, and Moria became filled with the servants of Sauron. Nimrodel and many other Silvan folk fled away south and Amroth departed to seek for her, never to return to Lórien.<ref name=silvan>{{NM|Silvan}}</ref>{{rp|fn. 9}}

Amroth eventually found her near [[Fangorn]], which she would not enter as she felt the trees had menaced her and blocked her path. There they spoke, and plighted their troth, but Nimrodel insisted that they would only be wed once Amroth had brought her to a land of peace. Amroth agreed to this, even though it meant abandoning his people in their time of need, and told her of the [[Edhellond|Elf-haven in the south]] from where many of his own people had sailed into the West and there still remained a remnant who built ships and offered passage for those of the [[Eldar]] who had grown weary of [[Middle-earth]].<ref name=amroth/>

As they travelled they became separated, and seeking for her Amroth came to the Elf-haven. There he found few other Elves still lingering, less than a ship-load, and but one remaining seaworthy ship, which was already preparing to depart. He was welcomed, but the others were unwilling to wait for Nimrodel as their was little hope she would actually come: if she had come by [[Gondor]] she would have been untroubled, and maybe even received aid; but if she came through the [[White Mountains|mountains]], there were many unfriendly Men and other evil things. The year was already waning to autumn, and soon great winds wold be expected which would make travel dangerous, even to Elven-ships. However, for the grief of Amroth, they relented and waited many weeks, living aboard the ship as their houses had already been stripped and made empty.<ref name=amroth/>

Eventually a great storm blew down from the north, sweeping away many ships of Men and tearing the light Elven-ship from its moorings. Amroth awoke to find the ship already far from land and in despair leapt into the sea in an attempt to swim back to shore. He battled for a long time against the waves, but was never seen again in Middle-earth.<ref name=amroth/>

With the disaster in Moria, and the loss of Amroth, Lórien was in great peril and its people began to flee, risking it being left deserted to be occupied by Orcs. Galadriel and Celeborn then returned to Lórien where they were welcomed by its people and took up rule of the realm.<ref name=amroth/>

In {{TA|3019}} the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] entered Lórien and [[Legolas]] sung to them the [[Lay of Nimrodel]] which detailed the tale of Amroth and Nimrodel. Legolas further declared that in spring, when the winds were in the South, the voice of Amroth came up from the sea.<ref>{{FR|Lorien}}</ref>

== Characteristics==
Amroth was said to be beautiful even for one of the Eldar, and valiant and wise. His hair was 'bright' and the sun gleaming off it was like a spark of gold.<ref name=amroth />

== Namesakes ==
Several places are named in honour of Amroth. Asides from Cerin Amroth, there were also [[Dol Amroth]], a princedom of Gondor,<ref>{{UT|8e}}, note 39</ref> and Edhellond was otherwise known as "Amroth's haven".<ref>{{RK|V9}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==

=== Separate characters ===
The name ''Amroth'' first appears as the leader of the Númenóreans who survived the [[Downfall of Númenor]], the character that would become [[Elendil]].<ref>{{LR|P1II1}}</ref>

=== Drafts of Lord of the Rings ===
Before settling on ''Amroth'' for the lost king of Lórien, Tolkien considered the names '''''Ammalas''''' and '''''Amaldor'''''.<ref>{{TI|XII}}</ref>

=== Concerning Galadriel and Celeborn ===
In the earliest versions of Amroth's origin, he was the son of [[Celeborn]] and [[Galadriel]], and brother of [[Celebrían]].

His birth was first given as between {{SA|350}} and {{SA|400}} while his parents dwelt at [[Nenuial]]. He travelled with his parents and came to dwell at [[Eregion]]. Galadriel entered friendship with the [[Longbeards|Dwarves of Khazad-dûm]], and with their assistance further came into contact with the realm of [[Lórinand]] which was peopled by [[Nandorin]] Elves who had no princes or rulers and led lives free of care. At some point between {{SA|1350}} and {{SA|1400}} strife between Galadriel & Celeborn the [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain]] resulted in the Mírdain seizing power. Galadriel, Amroth, and Celebrían then passed through [[Khazad-dûm]] to Lórinand, though Celeborn remained behind as he would not enter the mansions of the Dwarves.<ref name=concerning>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>

In {{SA|1695}} Amroth provided his aid by leading the Elves of Lórinand in the War of the Elves and Sauron.<ref name=concerning/>

Shortly after the war Galadriel, along with Celebrían, departed Lórinand, and committed it to Amroth. She reunited with Celeborn in [[Imladris]] and they remained there a long time before departing and settling in the [[Belfalas]] as the place that would afterwards be called Dol Amroth. There, Amroth would come at times to visit them, and their company was swelled by Elves from Lórinand. Galadriel and Celeborn remained there until Amroth was eventually lost in {{TA|1981}}.<ref name=concerning>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>

While dating of this text is not certain, [[Christopher Tolkien]] noted this lineage must have been later than the writing of the [[Lord of the Rings]], otherwise "had [Amroth] been supposed to be their son when it was written, the fact would surely have been mentioned."<ref name=concerning />

=== Other accounts ===
In a note concerning the House of Dol Amroth, Amroth is described as the brother of Celeborn. This was struck out however, and replaced with "was a Sinda from Beleriand".<ref>{{PM|VII}}</ref>

While working out Elf aging, Tolkien considered the following for Amroth: born in {{SA|33}}, full-grown by {{SA|105}}, (apparent age of) 29 by the founding of Eregion in {{SA|750}}, 35 at the sack of Eregion in {{SA|1697}}, 47⅙ at the end of the Second Age, and 60-61 by {{TA|1981}} at the time of the disaster in Moria. He was thus nearing the end of his youth, but (in mortal years) was about 45.<ref name=ages>{{NM|Ages}}</ref>

Tolkien also considered, but rejected, that Amroth might be the son of Celeborn, but not Galadriel. In this thought Celeborn's wife stole away, leaving him with their son Amroth. Tolkien considered that Elves, after the judgement of [[Míriel]] were permitted to lawfully remarry if one partner deserted the other. It would have been a very seldom occurrence, but could happen in such as time as the divided feelings of the end of the [[First Age]].<ref name=ages />{{rp|fn. 6}}

As son of Galadriel and Celeborn, Tolkien considered Amroth remaining in Eregion with Celeborn. With the onset of Sauron, Celeborn sent Amroth to Lórien, bearing one of the Three Rings for Galadriel.<ref>{{NM|Galadriel}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Amroth'' means "upclimber, high climber".<ref name=amroth/> It was probably of [[Silvan Elvish|Silvan]] origin, but adapted to [[Sindarin]].<ref>{{App|Elves}}, footnote relating to the first paragraph</ref> It was actually a nickname derived from his residing in a high [[talan]] or [[flet]], as living in such lofty houses was no doubt at first thought remarkable, and Amroth was probably the first to do so.<ref name=amroth/>
