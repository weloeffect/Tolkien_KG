In a 2023 interview for "Dragón Verde," a magazine of [[Sociedad Tolkien Colombia Orodruin]], he shared insights into his personal life, mentioning his love for his hometown of Prague and his affinity for history, architecture, and cartography as well as nature, particularly the forests and mountains. He mentioned that one of his favourite Tolkien characters is [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], reflecting his personal connection to the character's adventurous and homely sides. Matěj expressed his openness to future projects related to Tolkien's world and his desire to illustrate books or collaborate on projects related to the beloved author's works.<ref name=":0" />

In 2025, Čadil was commissioned to create the official t-shirt design for [[Oxonmoot 2025]]. The artwork, titled ''The Star of Hope'', evokes the poignant moment from The Return of the King when Sam Gamgee sees a star through the darkness of Mordor and hope returns to him. This design was praised for its emotional depth and faithful resonance with Tolkien’s themes.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1182791837217947&set=a.473462528150885 30 reasons to come to Oxonmoot 2025! – Reason no. 25: grab a t-shirt!]</ref>
