:Bell Goodchild is a Hobbit child, playing hide-and-seek with [[Gaffer Gamgee|Hamfast]], Sadoc, Hilda and a somewhat unwilling [[Bilbo Baggins]]. She hides on the top floor of the [[Old Mill]], which is only accessible by riding the water-wheel. Bell and Hamfast are shown to have a mutual love interest, but neither of them told the other.<ref>[[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|''The Hobbit'' (2003 video game)]], "Hobitton"</ref>
