'''Nimloth''' was the White Tree which grew in the [[King's Court]] in [[Armenelos]] of [[Númenor]]. It was brought as a gift by the [[Eldar]] from [[Tol Eressëa]], in the form of a seedling from [[Celeborn (White Tree)|Celeborn]] as a symbol of friendship between the two races. Its blossoms appeared as the [[Sun]] set, and their perfume filled the night in [[Númenor]]'s royal city.

Soon after {{SA|3262}}, it was cut down at the instigation of [[Sauron]] and its wood was used to light the first flames in the fire of the [[Temple]] of the new religion which worshipped [[Morgoth|Melkor]]. 

However, the night before [[Isildur]] stole a fruit from the tree and planted it in secret. The fruit grew into a seedling that Isildur carried to [[Middle-earth]] with him during the [[Downfall of Númenor]]. That seedling was planted in [[Minas Ithil]], and was destroyed before the end of the [[Second Age]]. Its seedling in turn grew into the first [[White Tree of Gondor]].
