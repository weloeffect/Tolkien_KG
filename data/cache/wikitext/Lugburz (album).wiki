'''''Lugburz''''' is the first full-length album by [[Summoning]] and was released in [[1995]]. The name is taken from [[Barad-dûr|Lugbúrz]], meaning "''dark tower''" in the [[Black Speech]], referring to [[Barad-dûr]]. Despite the album name, the cover artwork does not depict the tower of [[Sauron]] but is taken from the Roger Taylor novel ''The Fall of Fyorlund.''<ref>{{Cite web|articleurl=https://napalmrecords.com/english/lugburz-cd.html|articlename=Summoning - Lugburz|author=Napalm Records|accessed=25 July 2024}}</ref>
