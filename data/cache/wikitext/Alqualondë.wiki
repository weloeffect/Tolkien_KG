'''Alqualondë''', the '''Swanhaven''', was the chief city of the [[Falmari]] on the shores of [[Valinor]]. The city is said to be north and east of [[Tirion]] between the [[Calacirya]] and [[Araman]] in northern [[Eldamar]].

==Description==
The city was built in a natural harbour made of rock, and was also walled. Its entrance was a natural arch. Other than the great harbours, it also housed the mansions of Olwë. The city was covered with the pearls the Elves had found in the sea and jewels which they obtained from the [[Noldor]], and it was lit with many lamps. The famed [[swanships]] with golden beaks and eyes of jet were moored there.<ref>{{S|Eldamar}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Kinslaying of Alqualondë.jpg|thumb|left|''The Kinslaying of Alqualondë'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
In the [[Year of the Trees 1162]], the [[Falmari]] who abandoned [[Tol Eressëa]] began to build Alqualondë with the help of the [[Noldor]].<ref>{{AA}}</ref> Its lord was [[Olwë]]. 

When [[Fëanor]] rebelled against the will of the [[Valar]], he went to the shores of Aman, seeking for a way to reach [[Middle-earth]]. He demanded the use of the Telerin ships, however, the Teleri refused and resisted when Fëanor ordered the [[Noldor]] to take them by force. A battle broke out, the [[First Kinslaying]], in which many Teleri were slain, for they were armed with mere hunting bows against the fully armed Noldor. They also attempted to block the harbor. The battle was joined by the hosts of [[Fingon]] and [[Fingolfin]], many of whom thought that the Teleri had attacked the Noldor.

In the closing years of the [[First Age]], Alqualondë was visited by [[Eärendil]] and [[Elwing]] who had reached Valinor. Elwing stayed a little there and told stories to the [[Teleri]] about the griefs of [[Beleriand]].<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref>
