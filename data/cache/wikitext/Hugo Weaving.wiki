==Quotes==
{{quote|Elrond is a fount of knowledge and wisdom: he knows a great deal about the history of the Ring and understands not just what has happened but what might  happen.|Hugo Weaving, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Official Movie Guide]]''}}
{{quote|Whatever the outcome, the Elves will leave Middle-earth and be forgotten. There is, therefore, a sadness about Elrond which made me decide that - although he is an Elf - he also needed to have humanity, and that is what I have tried to bring to my performance.|Hugo Weaving, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Official Movie Guide]]''}}
{{quote|Having agreed to play Elrond, I realized how much had to be worked out about this character: the idea of portraying someone who is immortal, for one thing; plus the fact he is noble, wise, powerful, good - and beautiful! I began to think that he was altogether impossible to play!|Hugo Weaving, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Official Movie Guide]]''}}
