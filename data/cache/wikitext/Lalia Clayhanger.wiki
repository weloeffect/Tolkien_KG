'''Lalia Took, née Clayhanger''', was the wife of [[Thain]] [[Fortinbras Took II]].
==History==
===Life===
Lalia was born in {{SR|1283}}, and married Fortinbras Took in {{SR|1314}}. They had one son, [[Ferumbras Took III|Ferumbras]], who was born in {{SR|1316|n}} before Fortinbras became [[Thain]] in {{SR|1339|n}}. In accordance with [[Took Family|Took]] family tradition, Lalia became the head of the family once her husband Fortinbras died in {{SR|1380|n}}. Ferumbras was unable to find a wife and it was alleged that this was because he could not find someone willing to share a house with Lalia, and Ferumbras was only accorded a small bachelor pad in Great Smials until after Lalia's death.

Lalia long outlived her husband and ruled the [[Took Family|Tooks]] of [[Great Smials]] for a further twenty-two years, becoming the great and memorable matriarch of the family known as ''Lalia the Great'' (or least courteously by those with less love for her, ''Lalia the Fat''). She was famous for her tremendous girth, which was rumoured to have prevented her attendance of [[Bilbo Baggins]]' famous [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|Birthday Party]] in {{SR|1401|n}}.<ref name="L214">{{L|214}}</ref>

===Death===
In her later - and fattest - years it was her immobility rather than age which was the biggest problem for her so she went around in a wheelchair. In particular, she liked to be wheeled to the Great Door in the mornings so she could experience the fresh air.

She died in {{SR|1402|n}} at the grand old age of 119, after her clumsy attendant let Lalia's wheelchair run over the threshold which tipped Lalia down a flight of garden steps. It is rumoured that this attendant was [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]]'s sister, [[Pearl Took]], as she was excluded from the celebrations of Ferumbras's accession to Thain, but the family tried to keep the details to themselves. However, shortly after Lalia's demise, she was seen with a priceless pearl necklace, believed to be a Took heirloom, implying she may have been rewarded for the "accident".<ref name="L214"/>
