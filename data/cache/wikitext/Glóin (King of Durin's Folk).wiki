'''Glóin''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2136|n}} – {{TA|2385|n}}, died age 249) was the King of [[Durin's Folk]] for 96 years, succeeding his father [[Thorin I]] upon his death in {{TA|2289}}, being the heir of [[Durin|Durin the Deathless]].<ref name="AppA">{{App|A3}}</ref>

==History==
In {{TA|2210}} Glóin's father, King [[Thorin I|Thorin]], removed the last dwarves from [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] to the [[Grey Mountains]] where the remnants of [[Durin's Folk]] now were. Glóin reigned over the [[dwarves]] from there, but otherwise very little is known of his life and reign.

Glóin died in {{TA|2385|n}}, at the age of 249, and was succeeded by his son, [[Óin (King of Durin's Folk)|Óin]].<ref name="AppA"/>
