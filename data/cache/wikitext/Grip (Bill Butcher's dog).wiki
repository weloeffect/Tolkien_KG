'''Grip''' was a [[Dogs|dog]] inhabitant of the town of [[Delving]] who appeared in ''[[Perry-the-Winkle]]'', a nursery rhyme<ref name=collectedpoems>{{CP|105}}</ref> by [[Samwise Gamgee]]<ref name=preface>{{AB|Preface}}</ref>.<ref name="Perry">{{AB|Perry}}, pp. 41-4</ref>

In the poem, Grip was the companion of the knife-throwing [[Bill Butcher]], but he "turned his tail and ran to save his life" upon seeing the [[Lonely Troll]] peeping over the stalls of the market-place.<ref name="Perry" />

It is possible that Grip may have accompanied Bill Butcher later in the poem as the butcher may have been one of the [[Shire-hobbits]] who travelled to [[Faraway]] in order to demand food from the Lonely Troll.<ref name="Perry" />

==Background==
In the first version of the poem in early [[1928]],<ref name=commentary>{{AB|Comm}}, ''Perry-the-Winkle''</ref> which was entitled ''The Bumpus'', Grip didn't exist, but his role was given to "'''[[Harry]] and his father'''", both of whom fled for "their lives" after howling in fear.<ref name=collectedpoems>{{CP|105}}</ref> No changes to the characters occurred in the second version on [[29 March]],<ref name=collectedpoems/> in which Tolkien revised the poem as part<ref name=collectedpoems/> of his ''[[Tales and Songs of Bimble Bay]]'' series. The third version also retained the same details in relation to "Harry and his father".<ref name=commentary/>

In early [[1961]],<ref name=collectedpoems/> when Tolkien revised the poem for inclusion within ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'', the characters of "Harry and his father" were merged into Grip, Bill Butcher's dog.<ref name=commentary/>
