== Quotations ==
{{quote|When I draw illustrations, I have nothing but text. I am a man without imagination, what I see is what I sing. When I read, I have a mental picture of what is happening, and that's what I'm doing. I'm drawing exactly what I've read and imagined. I read the description of d'Artagnan or Gandalf, imagined them, and they are by no means Mikhail Sergeyevich Boyarsky or Ian McKellen, they are completely different people.|Denis Gordeev, [http://szfan2020.ru/article/2021/idealnoy-illyustracii-ne-sushchestvuet Interview].}}
