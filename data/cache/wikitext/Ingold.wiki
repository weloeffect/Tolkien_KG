'''Ingold''' was a soldier of [[Gondor]] during the [[War of the Ring]]. 

==History==
At the time of the War of the Ring, Ingold was the leader of a guard of [[Gondorians|Gondorian]] soldiers posted at the [[Forannest]], the northern gate of [[Rammas Echor]], the encircling wall of [[Pelennor Fields]]. They were repairing the wall on 8 March, when [[Gandalf]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] with Ingold’s permission passed into the townlands of [[Minas Tirith]] on their journey from [[Rohan]] to the city of Gondor.<ref>{{RK|MT}}</ref>

Less than five days after Gandalf had passed through, an army from the [[Rhûn|East]] had crossed the River [[Anduin]] and broke the Rammas. Ingold’s guard was the last to escape from the host, reporting to Minas Tirith that the northward road had been taken by the enemy. Due to Ingold’s news, it was thought that the [[Rohirrim]] could not come to Gondor’s aid.<ref>{{RK|Siege}}</ref>

==Etymology==
'''''[[Ingoldo]]''''', or ''i·[[Noldor|Ñoldo]]'', was the [[Amilessë|mothername]] of both [[Finarfin]] and his son [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]]. It became a frequently given name in [[Númenor]]; in the [[Third Age]] in Gondor, it was shortened to Ingold under influence of [[Westron]].<ref>{{PM|XINotes}}, p. 360, note 30</ref>

:Ingold is first met defending the northern gate of [[Rammas Echor]] where he tasks the player with slowing the enemy's advance and repelling the attacks on the wall, but eventually retreats to Minas Tirith. After the downfall of [[Sauron]] he becomes part of Gondorian army tasked with entering the Black Land and dealing with the evil that remains within. After King [[Aragorn|Elessar]] charges Steward [[Faramir]] with cleansing the evil of [[Minas Morgul]], Ingold and his men traverse the plateau of [[Gorgoroth]] and enter the [[Morgul Vale]] from the east.
