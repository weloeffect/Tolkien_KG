'''Haldir''' was an [[Elves|Elf]] of [[Lothlórien]], probably a [[Silvan Elves|Silvan Elf]], and a marchwarden who guarded the forest's northern borders. 

==History==
Haldir was one of the [[Galadhrim]]; unlike his brothers, [[Rúmil (elf of Lórien)|Rúmil]] and [[Orophin]], Haldir had traveled outside Lórien and knew [[Westron]]. He and his companions are described as wearing grey hooded cloaks and living on ''[[Telain|flets]]'' in the trees. 

Haldir was accompanied by his brothers between [[15 January|15]] and [[16 January]], {{TA|3019}}<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> when they encountered the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] who arrived in Lórien. His brothers interacted little with the Fellowship because they spoke little of the Common Speech. He treated [[Gimli]] rather poorly due to bad relations between Elves and Dwarves. He made him go blindfolded through the wood until [[Galadriel]] said he did not have to. 

He had heard of [[Aragorn]], but there is no indication that they had met before.<ref name="LL">{{FR|II6}}</ref> Haldir became their guide to the city of [[Caras Galadhon]]. 

After [[Celeborn]] and [[Galadriel]] had nourished their guests, and they were set to depart, Haldir led them to their Elven boats.<ref>{{FR|Farewell}}</ref>

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Haldir.mp3|Ardamir}}
''Haldir'' is clearly [[Sindarin]], but it is never glossed. In the earlier [[legendarium]], [[Tolkien]] glossed [[Noldorin]] ''Haldir'' as "Hidden Hero", though this [[Haldir (son of Orodreth)|Haldir]] refers to the (later omitted) son of [[Orodreth]].<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry "SKAL¹"</ref>
