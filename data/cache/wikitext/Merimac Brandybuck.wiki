'''Merimac Brandybuck''' was a Hobbit of [[Buckland]].

==History==
Merimac was the youngest son of [[Rorimac Brandybuck]] and [[Menegilda Goold]]. He had one son, [[Berilac Brandybuck|Berilac]], and they were both present at [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]].<ref>{{App|Brandybuck}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The meaning of the name ''Merimac'' is unknown. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] noted that the names of the Bucklanders had a vaguely [[Celtic]] style.<ref name="Translation">{{App|Translation}}, p. 1135</ref>

The name ''Merimac'' is, like most male Brandybuck names, Celtic in sound, but apparently meaningless. The first element, ''Meri'' also occurrs in the name ''[[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Meriadoc]]''. ''[[Wikipedia:Celtic onomastics|Mac]]'' is a Celtic word meaning "son", though it is unknown whether Tolkien used it with that meaning in mind.

The entire name also resembles ''[[wikipedia:Merrimac|Merrimac]]'', a name of a river and several towns in the United States. That word is of Native American origin.<ref>{{HM|IE}}, "Giving of Names", p. 204</ref>
