'''''Princess Mee''''' is a nonsense [[Hobbit]] poem that was among those written in the margins of the [[Red Book of Westmarch]].<ref>{{AB|Preface}}</ref>

== First stanza ==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Little Princess Mee
Lovely was she
As in elven-song is told:
She had pearls in hair
All threaded fair;
Of gossamer shot with gold
Was her kerchief made,
And a silver braid
Of stars above her throat.
Of moth-web light
All moonlit-white
She wore a woven coat,
And round her kirtle
Was bound a girdle
Sewn with diamond dew.<ref name=poem>{{AB|Mee}}</ref>
</poem>

== Background ==
The first draft of the poem was dated [[9 July]] [[1915]] and entitled '''''Mægden Ní Owéne Dohtor'''''<ref name=collectedpoems>{{CP|32}}</ref> and '''''Princess Nî'''''. A revised version entitled '''''The Princess Ní''''' was published in [[1924]] within ''[[Leeds University Verse 1914-24]]'' (p.&nbsp;58).<ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 853</ref> The name probably refers to the [[Celtic]] feminine patronymic ''ní''.<ref name=ab>{{AB|Comm}}</ref>

The poem was one of those Tolkien rediscovered, refurbished and revised around [[1961]] while preparing ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'', where it was published as ''Princess Mee''.<ref name=poem/>

The poem derives from ''The Princess Ní'', a poem Tolkien wrote in his youth, and one of those he refurbished and revised while preparing ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]''.<ref name=ab/>
