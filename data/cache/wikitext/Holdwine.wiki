'''Holdwine of the Shire''' was the name given to [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] among the [[Rohirrim]] by King [[Éomer]], and used by them to record his deeds in their annals.<ref>{{App|Mark}}, ''Third Line'', Footnote to ''Éomer Éadig''</ref> 
==Etymology==
The word is [[Old English]] but its meaning is never given explicitly; and there are several possible interpretations, of which one is "faithful friend". The name ''Holdwine'' is composed of the [[Old English]] elements ''hold'' ("faithful" or "loyal") and ''wine'' ("friend").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 644</ref>
