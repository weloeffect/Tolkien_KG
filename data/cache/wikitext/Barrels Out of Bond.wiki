==Summary==
[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - The Elvenking's Gate (II).jpg|thumb|180px|left|"[[Thranduil|The Elvenking]]'s Gate" by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]
Following their capture by the [[Elves of Mirkwood|Wood-elves]], [[Thorin]] and the Dwarves are imprisoned on the orders of the [[Thranduil|Elvenking]] ([[Thranduil]], father of [[Legolas]]), with Thorin in the deepest, darkest dungeon. [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] - who uses his [[the One Ring|magic ring]] to escape capture - once again proves his usefulness by conveying secret messages between the dwarves. The gates to the caves are sealed by magic; sometimes he is able to slip out with hunting parties but he spends a miserable life in the deepest, darkest corners of the palace.

One day, while wandering about, Bilbo discovers that the gates are not the only way out of the caves: a stream flowed through the lowest regions of the palace although the exit was blocked with a portcullis. As there were no vines in [[Mirkwood]], the [[Elves]] drank wines that "''were brought from far away, from their kinsfolk in the South, or from the vineyards of Men in distant lands''"; the empty wine barrels were floated back down the stream to [[Lake-town]], from where the wine came. 

One night, [[Galion]], the butler and the chief guard sneak downstairs to the wine cellars to drink of the wine; they get drunk, and fall asleep. Bilbo, still invisible, spots his opportunity: he steals the keys and sets the Dwarves free.

Bilbo stuffs them into the empty wine barrels, padding them with straw and drilling air holes in the barrels. The elves float the barrels down the river; the plan came close to ruin when the elves almost open the barrels due to their weight, however, the dwarves successfully escape to Lake-town.
