'''Caradhras''', called the '''Cruel''' by the [[Dwarves]], was one of the mightiest peaks in the [[Misty Mountains]]. The [[Redhorn Gate]] was a pass that ran along its southern slopes.<ref name="South">{{FR|II3}}</ref>

[[File:Tom Cross - Caradhras.jpg|thumb|left|''Caradhras'' by [[Tom Cross]]]]
Caradhras was the tallest and northernmost of the [[Mountains of Moria]], the three mountains which the great [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] city of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] was built under. The other two were [[Celebdil]] ("Silvertine") and [[Fanuidhol]] ("Cloudyhead"). Caradhras was described as "mighty peak, tipped with snow like silver, but with sheer naked sides". In the light of the rising or setting sun it appeared "dull red as if stained with blood".

Caradhras was called the Cruel by the Dwarves and had long had a bad reputation. The title was granted long before when the name of Sauron was just a rumour.<ref name="South" /> It was the site in Middle-earth where ''[[mithril]]'' was found and where [[Durin's Folk|Dwarves]] woke [[Durin's Bane]], the [[Balrogs|Balrog]] of [[Moria]].<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Caradhras.mp3|Ardamir}}
The name is [[Sindarin]] and means "Redhorn". It is composed of ''[[caran]]'' ("red") and ''[[ras]]'' ("horn"). As a compound, the contact of ''n'' next to ''r'' presents a phenomenon similar to ''[[prestanneth]]'': ''Cara'''n-r'''as'' is assimilated to ''Cara'''dhr'''as''.<ref name="Eldarin">{{PE|Eldarin}}</ref>{{rp|36}}

'''''[[Barazinbar]]''''' (or simply '''''[[Baraz]]'''''<ref name="South" />) is the literal [[Khuzdul]] translation of "Redhorn", from ''[[baraz]]'' + ''[[inbar]]''.<ref name="Eldarin" />{{rp|35}}

'''''Carnirassë''''' is the literal [[Quenya]] translation of "Redhorn", from ''[[carnë]]'' + ''[[rassë]]''.<ref name="Eldarin" />{{rp|36}}<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry '''KARÁN-'''</ref>

'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':''' 
:The Fellowship decides to take the Pass of Caradhas upon realising that passage South was being watched after they were spotted by a large flock of ''[[crebain]]''. Upon taking the Passage, a blizzard appears, accompanied by what Legolas calls "''...a fell voice on the air.''", to which Gandalf says that "''It is Saruman.''" It is shown that Saruman had summoned a great storm to harass the Fellowship on the Pass, until a lightning strike upon the mountain causes an avalanche that buries the Company in snow. At this, Boromir says to turn back and take the Gap of Rohan, to which Aragorn says that it would take the Company too close to Isengard, while Gimli suggests to "''...go [[Moria|under the mountain]].''" Gandalf has Frodo decide, as the Ringbearer, and Frodo elects Moria as the way of passage. Additionally, in his [[magic|spell]], Saruman mentions the [[Neo-Elvish|neo-Quenya]] name of Caradhras as ''Carnirassë''.<ref>{{webcite|website=ELF|articlename=Dialogs in FotR|articleurl=http://www.elvish.org/gwaith/movie_fotr.htm#spell|accessed=30 December 2018}}</ref>

'''2008: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Caradhras is featured in the region of [[Eregion]]. The snowstorms are very strong in this area, and an avalanche prevents further travel to the lands of the east.
