==Quotes==
{{quote|Lots of riding. I spent a whole month, five days a week, every week, doing horse riding lessons because Éomer is of Rohan, a horse nation.|Karl Urban, IGN interview}}
{{quote|I never had any in-depth discussion with Peter about the psychology of Eomer, or how the death of his parents may have affected him as a young man. Besides, any questions you need to ask are answered in the book, where you get to see how your piece of the puzzle fits in with the bigger picture. That's not a luxury you have on other projects.|Karl Urban, lordoftherings.net.}}
