'''Foalókë''' is a type of [[dragon]]. The name is only attested in [[Words, phrases and passages in The Lord of the Rings|a manuscript]] without context, so although it clearly means "breath-dragon",<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2876201031.html|articlename=Q. ''foalócë'' n.|website=Eldamo|accessed=1 March 2020}}</ref> it is unclear what kind of breath it means. If the trait referred to breathing fire or cold, then it was another name for [[dragons]].

==Etymology==
The word is [[Quenya]], ''[[foa]]'' ("breath") + ''[[lókë]]''.<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 181</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
The name was first conceived for "a serpent that guarded a treasure", as back then the [[Qenya]] word ''foa'' referred to "hoard".<ref>{{PE|12}}, p. 38</ref> The [[Gnomish]] form was ''Fuithlug'' ("a dragon (who guards treasure)").<ref>{{LT2|Appendix}}, p. 340</ref> The name was mainly applied to the dragon [[Glaurung#Other versions of the Legendarium|Glórund]].<ref>{{LT2|II}}, ''passim''</ref>
