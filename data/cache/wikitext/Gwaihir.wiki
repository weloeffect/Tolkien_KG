'''Gwaihir''', also called the '''Windlord''',<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref> was the greatest of the [[Eagles]] of northern [[Middle-earth]]<ref name=Council>{{FR|Council}}, p. 261</ref>  and the swiftest of the Great Eagles<ref name=Cormallen>{{RK|Cormallen}}, p. 948</ref> at the time of the [[War of the Ring]].

==History==
Gwaihir was the mightiest of the descendants of [[Thorondor]] and the brother of [[Landroval]].<ref name=Cormallen/> In the [[First Age]], Gwaihir was the vassal of Thorondor and helped Thorondor and Landroval to rescue [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] from [[Angband]].<ref name=P1>{{WJ|P1}}, $207, p. 68</ref>

During the [[War of the Ring]], [[Radagast]] rode in the direction of [[Mirkwood]] where he had many old friends. The Eagles set off and gathered news: [[wolves]] and [[Orcs]] gathering and mustering, the movements of the [[Nazgûl|Nine Riders]], and the escape of [[Gollum]] from Mirkwood.<ref name=Council/>

As instructed by Gandalf, Radagast sent Gwaihir to bear the news to him at [[Isengard]], but Gandalf was at that time imprisoned at the pinnacle of [[Orthanc]]. On an autumn night, Gandalf saw the Eagle flying towards him and so Gwaihir rescued the Wizard. But Gwaihir couldn't carry him far, so Gwaihir left him at [[Edoras]] in order to find a steed.<ref name=Council/>

Later he was sent by [[Galadriel]] to find Gandalf; he found him on the peak of [[Celebdil]] after the [[Battle of the Peak]], and carried him to [[Lothlórien]].<ref>{{TT|White}}, p. 502</ref> After Gandalf recovered, he sent Gwaihir to watch the [[Anduin]] and gather tidings.<ref>{{TT|White}}, p. 495</ref>

Gwaihir, [[Landroval]] and [[Meneldor]] and other great eagles helped the [[Free peoples]] in the [[Battle of the Morannon]] by stooping down on the [[Nazgûl]] who flew on winged beasts. After the destruction of the [[One Ring]] Gwaihir, Landroval, and Meneldor flew into [[Mordor]] to search for Frodo and Sam and carried Frodo and Sam out of Mordor to safety.<ref>{{RK|Cormallen}}, pp. 948-51</ref>

==Etymology==
'''''Gwaihir''''' is a [[Sindarin]] name,<ref name=PE17>{{PE|17}}, entry , S ''Gwaihir''pp. 33-4</ref> which probably means "Windlord",<ref name=Eldamo>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-1989488653.html|articlename=S. ''Gwaihir'' m.|website=Eldamo|accessed=20 March 2024}}</ref> because he is often referred to as "Gwaihir the Windlord".<ref name=Council/><ref>{{TT|White}}, pp. 495 and 502</ref><ref>{{RK|Cormallen}}, pp. 948-9</ref> The first element of the name is ''[[gwaew|gwae(w)]]'' ("wind").<ref name=PE17/> It is probable that the second element is ''[[hîr]]'' ("lord", "master").<ref name=Eldamo/><ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 247</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
Eagles named "Gwaihir" and "Landroval" (or, in even earlier texts, "Gwaewar" and "Lhandroval") appeared in an early version of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', as vassals of Thorondor who helped to bear [[Beren]] and [[Lúthien]] from [[Angband]].<ref name=P1/> These references were removed by [[Christopher Tolkien]] to escape the seeming discrepancy with ''The Lord of the Rings'', although later he admitted that this omission was a mistake.<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, 12-15 OF BEREN AND TINÚVIEL, commentary to ''with wings swifter than the wind'', p. 301</ref><ref>{{SD|V}}, pp. 44-5</ref>

In ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Gwaihir carries Gandalf twice, and by the end of the book Gandalf says that Gwaihir had carried him twice.<ref>{{RK|Cormallen}}, p. 949</ref> This can be interpreted to imply that Gwaihir never carried him before, but it is also possible that Gandalf only referred to the number of times that Gwaihir carried him in the recent past in the events that took place in ''The Lord of the Rings''.

[[Robert Foster]] implies that Gwaihir is the [[Lord of the Eagles]] of ''[[The Hobbit]]''<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry '''Gwaihir''', p. 181</ref> although [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] never made a connection nor mentioned that Gwaihir was the Lord of the Eagles. [[Douglas Anderson]]<ref>{{HM|AH}}</ref> and [[Anders Stenström]] (Beregond)<ref>[[Beyond Bree]], April and Mai 1987</ref> reject that Gwaihir is the Lord of Eagles of ''The Hobbit''.
