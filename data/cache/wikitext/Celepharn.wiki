'''Celepharn''' ({{TA|979}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 193</ref> - {{TA|1191|n}},<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 212) was the fourth [[King of Arthedain]].

==History==
Celepharn was the son of [[Mallor]] and the father of [[Celebrindor]]; he came to the throne of [[Arthedain]] upon the death of his father in {{TA|1110|n}}.<ref name="North"/>

During his rule, circa {{TA|1150|n}}, more ''[[Periannath]]'' (mostly [[Fallohides]] and [[Stoors]]) passed over the [[Misty Mountains]] and entered [[Eriador]] and the lands of [[Arnor]]. The Stoors settled mainly in [[Dunland]] or the [[Angle of Eriador|Angle]].<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>

Celepharn's rule coincided with that of [[Hyarmendacil I]] of [[Gondor]], under whom the Southern Kingdom reached the height of its power.<ref>{{App|South}}</ref>

Celepharn ruled Arthedain for eighty-one years, and was succeeded by his son, Celebrindor, upon his death in {{TA|1191|n}}.<ref name="North"/>

==Etymology==
The etymology of Celepharn's name is unknown. [[Robert Foster]] categorizes the name as [[Sindarin]].<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, (entry for ''Celepharn'')</ref> [[David Salo]] proposes that it might be composed of ''[[celeb]]'' ("silver") + [[lenition|lenited]]) ''[[sarn]]'' ("stone");<ref>{{HM|GS}}, p. 346</ref> in this case, ''ph'' should not represent ''f'', but two sounds pronounced separately as "celep-harn".

Earlier, Anthony Bryant speculated that the second element is a derivative of the [[Sundocarme|root]] PHAR ("reach, go all the way, suffice"), thus meaning something like "enough silver" or  "sufficient silver".<ref>{{webcite|author= Anthony J.
