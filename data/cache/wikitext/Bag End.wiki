{{quote|In a hole in the ground there lived a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]]. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a Hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.|Opening lines of ''[[The Hobbit]]''<ref name="Unexpected">{{H|Party}}</ref>}}

'''Bag End''' or '''Bag-End'''  was a [[Hobbit-holes|smial]] in [[Hobbiton]], the residence of the [[Baggins Family]] and later the [[Gardner Family]].

The entrance to Bag End was a perfectly round green door featuring a brass knob in the center.  The entryway was a tube-shaped hall with paneled walls and a tiled floor, furnished with carpeting, polished chairs, and an abundance of pegs for the hats and coats of many visitors.  The tunnel continued into the hill with side doors that were also round.  All of the rooms were on the same level – bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, multiple pantries, wardrobes, kitchens, and dining rooms.  The best rooms were those on the left side of the passage for they had deep-set round windows with a view of the garden and meadows beyond down to [[The Water]].<ref name="Unexpected"/>

==History==
{{quote|You can say what you like, Gaffer, but Bag End's a queer place, and its folk are queerer.|[[Sandyman]]<ref name="Party">{{FR|Party}}</ref>|center}}

Bag End was built into [[Hobbiton Hill]] by [[Bungo Baggins]], where he went to live with his new wife, [[Belladonna Took]]. The hole was largely financed by her.<ref name="Unexpected"/> The earth removed was shot over the edge of the sudden fall in the hillside onto the ground; this lane would thenceforth be known as "[[Bagshot Row]]".<ref name="N">{{HM|N}}, p. 763-5</ref> The hole was inherited by Bungo's son [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]].

Bilbo employed [[Holman Greenhand]], [[Hamfast Gamgee]],<ref>{{UT|Erebor}}</ref> to tend to its gardens. During Bilbo's [[Quest for Erebor|disapparance]], he was presumed dead, when he returned in {{TA|2942}} just in time to see his estate being auctioned by [[Messrs Grubb, Grubb and Burrowes]].<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref> During that time Holman and Ham tried to protect the garden from the crowd. The [[Sackville-Baggins Family|Sackville-Bagginses]] hoped that Bag End would be theirs (and [[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins|Lobelia]] allegedly snatched some silver spoons).<ref name="Party"/> 

In {{SR|1389}} Bilbo adopted orphan [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] as his heir (disappointing the [[Sackville-Baggins Family|Sackville-Bagginses]] who coveted it for years), with whom they shared same birthday. Together they gave famous combined birthday parties in Bag End. While preparing for his [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|famous party]], Bag End was closed, with only [[Gandalf]] and some [[Dwarves of Erebor]] working there.<ref name="Party"/>

Bag End in turn was left to Frodo, in {{SR|1401}} along with all the chief treasures, books, pictures and furniture. The [[23 September|next day]] of the party and Bilbo's disappearance, many hobbits crowded Bag End to inquire what happened and to collect farewell gifts. This caused the rumor that Bilbo's household was given out for free and many came for loot; they tried to loot overlooked small items, make swaps or deals, even mixed or removed labels from presents that Bilbo prepared. Three young hobbits even knocked holes in the walls of one of the cellars, and [[Sancho Proudfoot]] dug in the larger pantry, looking for Bilbo's mysterious treasure. Frodo attempted to block the entrance with barrows and handcarts and had [[Merry Brandybuck]] to keep an eye.<ref name="Party"/> 

When he too left [[The Shire]], he sold it to Lobelia by [[June]] {{TA|3018}}. Frodo had bought a house at [[Crickhollow]] and his friends helped him empty and pack his household, and celebrated with them his last [[22 September|birthday]] party in Hobbiton. The title would pass to Lobelia on [[24 September]], but she arrived [[23 September|one day early]] with her son [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins|Lotho]] to inspect the remaining items. Leaving Bag End, Frodo left the keys with his neighbor [[Gaffer Gamgee]].<ref>{{FR|Three}}</ref> It was used by Lotho as he declared himself [[Chief Shirriff]]. [[Sharkey]] also adopted the hole as his base, digging up Bagshot Row and erecting many houses in its stead. After the [[Battle of Bywater]], it was largely restored to normal, and Frodo took up residence in the hole again.<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>

After [[Frodo Baggins]] left [[Middle-earth]], he gave Bag End to [[Samwise Gamgee]], whose family, the Gardners, would live in it for many years.<ref>{{RK|Havens}}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s aunt [[Jane Neave]]'s farm was called Bag End by the locals in Dormston, Worcestershire.
{{quote|It [Bag End] was the local name for my aunt's [Jane Neave] farm in Worcestershire, which was at the end of a lane leading to it and no further...|[[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings|''Nomenclature'']]<ref name="N"/>}}

The name can also be seen as a pun on "cul-de-sac" (literally "bottom of the bag").<ref name="N"/>

In the books, it is supposedly a translation of the [[Westron]] ''[[Laban-neg]], [[Labin-nec]]'', which has much the same meaning, and the same relationship to the Westron form of Baggins: ''[[Labingi]]''.<ref name="PM">{{PM|Languages}}</ref>

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:Bag End is the starting point. Prior to leaving, the deed and key have to be found. The One Ring is also kept inside a chest, but Frodo will not take it out until after he has sold Bag End to Lobelia Sackville-Baggins.

'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''
:As with ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' films, ''The Hobbit'' trilogy opens with an older Bilbo in the study of Bag End. In crafting the set, the designers said they were inspired by [[wikipedia:Victorian decorative arts|Victorian aesthetics]] but chose to make the home brighter and with lighter, earthier colours, reflecting the fact this is 60 years earlier than ''The Lord of the Rings'' and home to a much younger hobbit. The pantry was designed to be overly-stocked whilst the whole home - especially the bedroom - was stuffed with plump furnishings to reflect Bilbo's "comfortable" lifestyle.<ref>[[Daniel Falconer]], ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey: Chronicles: Art & Design]]'', pp. 16-20</ref>
