{{Quote|Take your sword and bear it unto good fortune!|[[Théoden]] to Merry, ''[[The Return of the King]]'', "[[The Passing of the Grey Company]]"}}

'''Meriadoc ''"Merry"'' Brandybuck''', called '''''The Magnificent''''', was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]], the son of [[Saradoc Brandybuck]].<ref name="tree">{{App|Brandybuck}}</ref> He was one of the four Hobbits in the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] and later became the Knight of Rohan, participating in the slaying of the [[Witch-king|Witch-king of Angmar]] alongside Lady [[Éowyn]].

Merry was an heir to the [[Brandybuck Family|Brandybucks]] of [[Brandy Hall]]. After his participation to the [[War of the Ring]], he eventually inherited the [[Master of Buckland|Mastership]] in [[Buckland]] after his father's death.

==History==
Meriadoc was the son of [[Saradoc Brandybuck|Saradoc]] and [[Esmeralda Took|Esmeralda]]. Claiming descent from [[Gorhendad Oldbuck]], he also had  [[Took Family|Tookish]] blood through his mother, and also his father's grandmother, [[Mirabella Took]]. He was also first cousins with Peregrin Took.<ref name="tree" /> With him they wandered in the [[Marish]] and were friends of [[Farmer Maggot]].<ref name="mushrooms" />

Around {{TA|3000}} Merry witnessed a strange scene: he saw [[Bilbo Baggins]] becoming invisible in order to avoid a meeting with the [[Sackville-Bagginses]]. Startled, he got through the hedge and walked along the field inside, and watched as Bilbo reappeared, and put a [[The One Ring|glint of gold]] in his pocket. This made teenage Meriadoc very curious and he even looked into Bilbo's [[There and Back Again|private diary]].<ref name="Conspiracy" />

Merry kept this knowledge private but was always suspicious. He was present with his family at [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]]<ref name="tree" /> and [[23 September|the next day]] of Bilbo's disappearance, [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] had a hard day keeping his things from unwanted hobbits who came to loot [[Bag End]], and put Merry to keep an eye on them in order to rest; until the [[Sackville-Baggins Family|Sackville-Bagginses]] came to Merry demanding to see Frodo. Later [[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins|Lobelia]] left angrily calling Frodo a "Brandybuck", which Merry said was a compliment.<ref>{{FR|Party}}</ref>

Since Bilbo's disappearance, he believed that Frodo would soon follow. He shared his secrets with [[Conspirators|a group of Frodo's friends]], namely [[Samwise Gamgee]], [[Peregrin Took]], [[Fredegar Bolger]]. Especially after [[April]] {{TA|3018}} he noticed how Frodo was saying "farewell" to his favourite places, selling [[Bag End]] to the [[Sackville-Bagginses]], and secretive talks with [[Gandalf]]. All along, Sam Gamgee had been their "chief investigator". He heard Gandalf's instructions to Frodo for his departure,<ref>{{FR|Shadow}}</ref> and warned his friends about it.<ref name="Conspiracy" />
[[File:Abe_Papakhian_-_A_Conspiracy_Unmasked.jpg|thumb|left|Abe Papakhian - ''A Conspiracy Unmasked'']]
The Conspirators, sought to protect Frodo (and [[The One Ring|the Ring]]) without his knowledge. When Frodo sold [[Bag End]] to move to [[Crickhollow]], Merry and Fredegar were told to wait for him and make preparations for his arrival.<ref>{{FR|Three}}</ref> However, knowing that Frodo would begin a secret journey, also arranged for provisions and [[ponies]], planning to accompany him. On the [[September 25|appointed day]], Merry was worried that Frodo was late and as the fog was getting thick, he crossed the [[Bucklebury Ferry]] towards [[Stock]] to see if his friends were lost; just as he crossed, he saw [[Farmer Maggot]]'s wagon approaching, bringing Frodo, Sam and Pippin.<ref name="mushrooms">{{FR|Mushrooms}}</ref> 

After dinner in Crickhollow, Frodo prepared to reveal to his friends that he was going to have to leave Crickhollow and go to [[Rivendell]]. It was then that the conspirators revealed themselves to Frodo and demanded to be taken along when he left. Because of their preparations, they were able to start right away.<ref name="Conspiracy">{{FR|I5}}</ref>

===Journey with Frodo===
{{quote|You can trust us to stick to you through thick and thin - to the bitter end. And you can trust us to keep any secret of yours - closer than you keep it yourself. But you cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone, and go off without a word. We are your friends, Frodo.|Merry, ''[[A Conspiracy Unmasked]]''}}
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Under the Spell of the Barrow-wight.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Under the Spell of the Barrow-wight'']]
During the following trip to [[Rivendell]], Merry seemed to have a greater knowledge of the [[Old Forest]] than any of the other Hobbits.  However, when they encountered [[Old Man Willow]] Merry (and Pippin) were both captured and had to be rescued by [[Tom Bombadil]].<ref>{{FR|I6}}</ref>  Merry and Pippin were captured again (along with Sam and Frodo) by a [[Barrow-wights|Barrow-wight]] upon the [[Barrow-downs]], but Tom again came to their rescue. Before leaving, he told them to keep the [[Daggers of Westernesse]] found in the Barrow Downs, and he advised them to spend the night at the [[The Prancing Pony|Prancing Pony Inn]], inside [[Bree]].<ref>{{FR|I8}}</ref> 
[[File:John Howe - Weathertop on the Horizon.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Howe]] - ''Weathertop on the Horizon'']]
Upon reaching the inn, Merry was out for a walk and saw a [[Nazgûl|Black Rider]]. He tried to follow it, but it disappeared. Merry was then overtaken by the [[Black Breath]] and fainted. But before any harm could come to him, [[Nob]] came to his aid; he returned to the Prancing Pony and warned his companions who were talking with [[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]].<ref name="Strider">{{FR|I10}}</ref>  During the trip through the wild with Strider, he often saw the most deeply into the others.  After Frodo was wounded on [[Weathertop]], he became the one who consulted most with Strider, and in a way became the spokesman for the Hobbits.

After reaching [[Rivendell]], he, with Pippin, insisted on not being left behind on the [[Quest of the Ring]].  Therefore they were chosen as the eighth and ninth members of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]].<ref>{{FR|II3}}</ref>

At the gate of [[Moria]], [[Gandalf]] commended Merry for being "''of all people''" on the right track with the riddle (though this was accidental).  His impetuosity in Moria was such that he nearly fell into an ancient well while running ahead with Pippin.<ref>{{FR|II4}}</ref>  When they reached [[Lothlórien]], he was allowed to sleep in a [[telain]] with Frodo, Sam, Pippin and a few elven guards. He, as with the rest of the Company, walked blindfolded into the Woods of Lórien in a show of support for [[Gimli]], who had to be blindfolded due to being a [[Dwarves|dwarf]].<ref>{{FR|II6}}</ref>
[[File:Alan Lee - The Plains of Rohan 2.jpg|thumb|"The Plains of Rohan" by [[Alan Lee]]]]
At the [[Breaking of the Fellowship]], Merry and Pippin ran straight into a company of [[Orcs]] while they were looking for Frodo.  [[Boromir]] attempted to rescue them, but many [[Uruk-hai]] arrived, and they shot him with arrows.  Captured with Pippin by Uruk-hai, the two were separated from the rest of the Fellowship.  Merry aided Pippin in an attempt to deceive [[Grishnákh]] into thinking that they had the One Ring, and he could have it.<ref>{{TT|III3}}</ref>  Because of this, they escaped into [[Fangorn Forest]] during the attack by [[Éomer]] and his [[Rohirrim|Outriders]]. There they met [[Treebeard]].  
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Wellinghall.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Wellinghall'']]
[[File:Zina Saunders - Flotsam and Jetsam.jpg|thumb|Zina Saunders - ''Flotsam and Jetsam'']]
Thus they became the first mortals for many centuries to encounter the [[Ents]] of Fangorn. They drank of the [[Ent-draughts|Ent-draught]] which caused Merry and Pippin to become the tallest hobbits in history. Also, they were present at the [[Entmoot]],<ref>{{TT|III4}}</ref> and the resulting destruction of [[Isengard]], after which Treebeard appointed them door-wardens of [[Orthanc]]. It was while they were enjoying [[Saruman]]'s [[pipe-weed]], that they were reunited with some of their former companions, who arrived after the [[Battle of the Hornburg]].<ref>{{TT|III8}}</ref>

===Esquire of Théoden===
While Pippin and Gandalf headed away to [[Minas Tirith]], Merry stayed with Aragorn and the Rohirrim, developing a close friendship with King [[Théoden]].  Out of love for him, Merry offered the King his service, which Théoden warmly accepted.  "''As a father you shall be to me''", Merry said at that time, and Théoden responded "''For a little while''".<ref>{{RK|V2}}</ref>

As Théoden's esquire, Merry returned with him to [[Edoras]] and was forbidden - firmly but gently - by the King to ride with them to the aid of Minas Tirith because he could not ride the mighty horses of the Rohirrim so fast and so far.  Merry was disappointed until a young rider named [[Dernhelm]] offered to bear him on his horse.<ref>{{RK|V3}}</ref>  In this manner he rode to the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], having a secret understanding with [[Elfhelm]] and several others of the Rohirrim.<ref>{{RK|V5}}</ref>
[[File:Angus McBride - Eowyn against Witch-king.gif|thumb|left|[[Angus McBride]] - ''Éowyn against Witch-king'']]
During the charge and the commencement of the battle he was almost useless, hiding behind Dernhelm and shaking with fright and nausea.  However, Dernhelm's steed, [[Windfola]], threw them both upon the coming of the [[Witch-king]].  Affected by the Black Breath, Merry lay almost senseless on the ground, hearing the voice of Dernhelm standing over the body of Théoden—who had been mortally wounded by the Witch-king—defying the Nazgûl.  He was startled as he opened his eyes to find that Dernhelm was really [[Éowyn]], the King's niece.  After Éowyn was thrown down, perhaps mortally wounded, Merry rose to attack the Witch-king in order to protect her.  He pierced the sinew behind the Witch-king's mighty knee with the [[Daggers of Westernesse|Barrow-blade]] he still bore, thus breaking the spell of invulnerability surrounding the Wraith.  He witnessed Éowyn's destruction of the Witch-king with a thrust into the head, and her subsequent collapse.<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref> After the death of the Witch-king, he begged forgiveness of a dying Théoden for disobeying his command to remain at Edoras, and the king forgave him with the words "''Great heart will not be denied.''" After the death of the king, he walked beside Théoden's pall-bearers, and fell into a stupor induced by the [[Black Breath]] at some point in his journey.<ref name="Houses">{{RK|V8}}</ref>

After the battle, Pippin found him ill and wandering in a daze outside of [[Minas Tirith]] and alerted Aragorn, who brought him into the city. Almost killed by the Black Breath, Merry and Éowyn were revived by Aragorn in the [[Houses of Healing]].<ref name="Houses" />  Because of his condition he was unable to take part in the [[Battle of the Morannon]],<ref>{{RK|V10}}</ref> but afterwards attended the burial of [[Théoden]], at which he wept greatly.  Upon his departure for the Shire, he was given a special horn by Éomer and Éowyn as a parting gift, which was later used in the [[Battle of Bywater]].<ref>{{RK|VI6}}</ref>

Upon the return to the Shire, he was, with Pippin, the primary leader of the uprising against [[Sharkey]] and his [[Ruffians]].<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>

===After the war===
At some time he stayed with Pippin at Crickhollow<ref>{{RK|Havens}}</ref> and he married the sister of his friend Fredegar, [[Estella Brandybuck|Estella]].

He was afterwards known as '''Meriadoc the Magnificent''', and became [[Master of Buckland]] after his father, and received great gifts from his friends King Éomer and Lady Éowyn.<ref name="later">{{App|Later}}</ref> He wrote several scholarly works which were probably part of the [[Red Book]]: ''[[Herblore of the Shire]]'', ''The [[Reckoning of Years]]'' and ''[[Old Words and Names in the Shire]]''. At some point he visited Rivendell several times where probably he collected historical information from the remaining Elves there, and probably assisted the assembly of the [[Tale of Years]] in the [[Great Smials]].<ref name="records">{{FR|records}}</ref> In {{FoA|13}} he was made with Pippin and Sam Counsellor of the [[North-kingdom]].<ref name="later" />

In {{FoA|63}}<ref name="records" /> Meriadoc was 102 but still hale. That spring he received an invitation from King Éomer. With his friend they resigned from their offices and came down to Rohan<ref name="later" /> (presumably after the death of his wife) where he was known as Master Holbytla and [[Holdwine]] of the Shire.  

They stayed in Edoras with the King before he died that autumn, then they travelled to [[Gondor]] with Pippin, where he was known as Master [[Perian]], to spend their remaining years. They both were laid in [[Rath Dínen]].  It was said that upon [[Aragorn|King Elessar]]'s death, their bodies were placed beside his.<ref name="later" />

==Character==
[[File:Nia Kovaleski - Merry and Pippin.jpeg|thumb|right|''Merry and Pippin'' by [[:Category:Images by Nia Kovalevski|Nia Kovaleski]]]]He was a good friend of [[Frodo Baggins]], who eventually became the [[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]], and [[Peregrin Took]], a young relative.  He was one of the few (if any) who saw [[Bilbo Baggins]], Frodo's uncle, actually use [[the One Ring]].  He also managed to read, at least in part, Bilbo's book: ''[[There and Back Again]]'', where he learned about the Ring.<ref name="Conspiracy" />

He can easily be recognised as a very sharp Hobbit, and his tone throughout ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' depicts him as practical, loyal, resourceful, and the best able to cope with the sudden happenings that drew him out of his peaceful home.  He was also praised by [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]] as having a 'stout heart'<ref name="Strider" /> and [[Éowyn|Lady Éowyn]] as 'valiant'.<ref>{{RK|Houses}}</ref>  He was apparently much trusted by Frodo, who sent him along with [[Fredegar Bolger|Fatty Bolger]] to [[Crickhollow]] to prepare his newly-bought home.<ref>{{FR|I3}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name '''''Meriadoc''''' means "Great Lord" in [[Welsh]] (from ''mawr'' "great" and ''udd'' "lord").<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.namenerds.com/welsh/meaning.html|articlename=Welsh Names|website=[http://www.namenerds.com/ Name Nerds]|accessed=21 February 2016}}</ref>

Merry's full [[Westron]] name was ''Kalimac'', which was abbreviated to ''Kali''.  As this latter means "jolly, gay", Tolkien translated it as ''Merry'', from which ''Meriadoc'' was chosen as a plausible full form.  This is in contrast to other Hobbit personal names, which were converted into roughly corresponding English forms.<ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref>

Tolkien himself comments on the "[[Celtic]] cast" of this and other [[Buckland]] and [[Bree]] names that end in ''–ac'', ''-ic'', or ''-oc''.<ref>{{HM|PM}}, "[[The Appendix on Languages]]"</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the pre-publication manuscript of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Merry's name was originally "Marmaduke Brandybuck".<ref>{{RS|1Iiii}}, p. 33</ref> He also had a cousin named ''Bercilak'', a name that is shared by the Green Knight from [[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (poem)|Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]] in some translations.<ref>{{Webcite|articleurl=https://www.bbc.co.uk/teach/class-clips-video/articles/zf2kxyc|articlename=KS2 English: Sir Gawain and the Green Knight - Episode 1|website=bbc.co.uk|accessed=25 July 2024}}</ref> This name was later changed to [[Lanorac Brandybuck]].<ref>{{RS|2XVI}}</ref>

==Inspiration==
''[[Wikipedia:Conan Meriadoc|Conan Meriadoc]]'' (also spelled ''Meriadek'') was the legendary leader of a group of Welsh mercenaries who settled Armorica (modern Brittany) in the fourth century and founded the [[Wikipedia:House of Rohan|House of Rohan]] in [[Wikipedia:Geoffrey of Monmouth|Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Wikipedia:Historia Regum Britanniae|Historia Regum Britanniae]]''.<ref>{{HM|IE}}, "Giving of Names", "The Celtic-sounding Names", pp. 202-203</ref><ref>[[Mark T. Hooker]], ''[[The Hobbitonian Anthology]]'', p. 57</ref>
