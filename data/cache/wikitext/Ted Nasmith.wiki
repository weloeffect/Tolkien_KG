'''Ted Nasmith''' is a Canadian artist, illustrator, and musician most known for illustrating many works by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].
==Early life==
In his childhood and teens, Nasmith was introduced to ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' by his sister and was absorbed. In [[1972]] he mailed to Tolkien photographs of his work. Tolkien replied with praise, but also with criticism, saying that his rendition of Bilbo in the painting ''[https://www.tednasmith.com/tolkien/the-unexpected-party/ The Unexpected Party]'' was "too childlike".<ref>{{webcite|author=Anders Dahlgren (aka "Elrond")|articleurl=https://www.radiorivendell.com/article/2012/04/25/ted-nasmith/|articlename=Radio Rivendell interviews Ted Nasmith

==Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings==
Many fans of Ted Nasmith have expressed disappointment in his lack of involvement in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]].
{{quote|I was contacted by a producer in early '99. They invited me to be there with the others in New Zealand to help with conceptual art, and made me a nice offer. However, I was going through a personal crisis unrelated to my art, and in the end, being that it would also force me to abandon my freelance obligations and be away indefinitely, I reluctantly declined, settling the question in my mind after very careful deliberation. It was a difficult decision.|Ted Nasmith <ref>{{redlink|[http://www.dreamish.com/artist/tednasmith.shtml]}}</ref>}}

One fan has created a website known as [http://tednasmith.narod.ru Ted Nasmith: The Uncredited Lord of the Rings Films Concept Artist]. The website displays side-by-side illustrations by Nasmith with later scenes in The Lord of the Rings films. [[Peter Jackson]] was inspired by Nasmith - as [[Alan Lee]] described: 
{{quote|"[T]here were certain pictures of Ted's that Peter quite liked. He actually bought one of Nasmith's originals --- a very striking picture of Mordor"|Alan Lee <ref>{{redlink|[http://einsiders.com/features/interviews/alanlee.php]}}</ref>}}
