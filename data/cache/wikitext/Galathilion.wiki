'''Galathilion''', the '''White Tree''', was a tree made by [[Yavanna]] for the [[Elves]] of the city of [[Tirion]]. It was made in the image of [[Telperion]], as the [[Amanyar]] loved it most of the [[Two Trees]], although Galathilion gave no light.<ref name=s5/>

It grew in the [[Great Square]], a high open courtyard beneath the [[Mindon Eldaliéva]], and had many seedlings in [[Eldamar]]. From it came [[Celeborn, White Tree|Celeborn]], the White Tree of [[Tol Eressëa]];<ref name=s5>{{S|5}}</ref> through which it became the ancestor of [[Nimloth of Númenor]] and the [[White Tree of Gondor]].<ref name=Ak/>

==Etymology==
Galathilion is [[Sindarin]] for "White Tree",<ref name=s5/> from ''[[galadh]]'' ("tree") + ''[[sil|thil]]'' ("shine silver)".<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entries ''kal-'', ''sil-''</ref>

The final element could be the patronymic ''[[-ion]]'', perhaps indicating the tree descents from Telperion.<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3011243921.html|articlename=S. ''Galathilion'' pn.|website=Eldamo|accessed=30 June 2020}}</ref>

==Other names==
It was also known as the '''Tree of Tirion'''<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref> or '''Tree of [[Túna]]'''.<ref name=Ak>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref>

''Galathilion'' was at first a name for Telperion, "but in after days ''Galathilion the Less'' was the name of the White Tree of Túna."<ref>{{MR|P3I2}}, p. 155</ref>

[[Legolas]] noted that the [[Doors of Durin]] displayed the '''Tree of the High Elves''',<ref>{{FR|Journey}}</ref><ref group="note">Actually the [[:File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Doors of Durin.jpg|drawing of the Doors]], displays a ''pair'' of trees flanking the composition, not a sole tree; unless they are both taken to symbolize the "Tree of the High Elves".</ref> which probably represented Galathilion.<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entries "Emblems — Eldar", "Tree of the High Elves"</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=Mark Fisher|articleurl=http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/t/treeofthehighelves.html|articlename=Tree of the High Elves|dated=4 July 2008|website=EoA}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the poem ''[[Imram]]'', [[Saint Brendan]] in his deathbed is able to remember a White-tree from his travels that cannot be other than Galathilion:<ref>{{SD|Imram}}, pp. 297-8</ref>

{{blockquote|In that hidden land we saw there stand<br />
under a moonlight dim<br />
a Tree more fair than ever I deemed<br />
in Paradise might grow:<br />
its foot was like a great tower's root,<br />
its height no man could know;<br />
and white as winter to my sight<br />
the leaves of that Tree were;<br />
they grew more close than swan-wing plumes,<br />
long and soft and fair.|''[[Imram]]'' (The Death of Saint Brendan), vv. 67-76}}

In a [[Quenya]] note published in ''[[Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth]]'', the tree is referred to by the name ''[[Amalion]]''.<ref>[[Catherine McIlwaine]], ''[[Tolkien: Maker of Middle-earth]]'', p. 182</ref>
