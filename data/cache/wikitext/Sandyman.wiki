'''Sandyman''' was the miller of [[Hobbiton]].
==History==
Sandyman owned and ran the [[Old Mill]] in [[Hobbiton]] around {{SR|1401}} and well before.<ref>{{RK|Scouring}}</ref> [[Gaffer Gamgee|The Gaffer]] was not very fond of Sandyman, or his habits of telling tall tales and having quick judgment of others.

Prior to [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]], while gossiping about [[Frodo Baggins]] and the death of his parents, Sandyman related the rumour that [[Primula Brandybuck|his mother]] had pushed [[Drogo Baggins|his father]] from a boat and he pulled her down; and was scolded by Gaffer for believing such rumours. He wondered about augmenting his wealth by going out for journeys, and [[Gandalf]] and [[Dwarves]] visiting him.<ref>{{FR|Party}}</ref>

Some time before the [[War of the Ring]], Sandyman died and passed his mill on to his son [[Ted Sandyman|Ted]].

==Inspiration==
Possibly the miller at [[Sarehole]] Mill, Warwickshire, England

{{quote|I never liked the looks of the Young miller, but his father, the Old miller, had a black beard, and he was not named Sandyman.|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]]<ref>{{FR|Foreword}}</ref>}}
