'''Belladonna Baggins''' (née '''Took''') ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2852|n}} - {{TA|2934|n}}, died aged 82) was the mother of [[Bilbo Baggins]].

==History==
Belladonna was one of the three remarkable daughters of the [[Gerontius Took|Old Took]].<ref name="Party">{{H|Party}}</ref> She had eight older brothers (and one younger), and was the eldest of the three daughters.<ref name="Took">{{App|Took}}</ref> Belladonna married [[Bungo Baggins]], who built a spacious hole for her (partly with her money).<ref name="Party"/> It became the residence of the [[Baggins Family]], and in {{TA|2890|n}}, her son and only child [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] was born. She died in {{TA|2934|n}},<ref name="Took"/> eight years after her husband.<ref>{{App|Baggins}}</ref> 

==Etymology==
''[[wikipedia:Atropa belladonna|belladonna]]'' is the name of a poisonous plant,<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Douglas A. Anderson]], ''[[The Annotated Hobbit]]'', "[[An Unexpected Party]]", note 8</ref> fitting in with the Hobbit-habit of naming girls after flowers.<ref>{{App|F2}}</ref>

The word is understood as an Italian name, a rarity among Hobbits, and translates as "beautiful lady" although it derives from Latin ''bladone'' "nightshade".

The name participates in a circular wordplay with the names of her sisters, [[Mirabella Took|Mira'''bella''']] and [[Donnamira Took|'''Donna'''mira]], also Italian names.

==Inspiration==
In her first appearance in the fiction, Belladonna - which has stayed unchanged from the earliest survived sketch of the story<ref>{{HM|MB}}, "[[The Bladorthin Typescript]]"</ref> -  is described as "one of three remarkable daughters of the Old Took". [[Humphrey Carpenter]], in his attempt to draw an analogy between Bilbo and Tolkien, noted that Tolkien's mother, [[Mabel Suffield]], was one of three remarkable daughters of [[John Suffield]], who lived to be nearly a hundred.<ref>{{B|IV}}, "Enter Mr. Baggins", page 175</ref>
