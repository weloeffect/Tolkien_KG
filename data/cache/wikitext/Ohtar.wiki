'''Ohtar''' was a kinsman<ref name=GladdenNote>{{UT|7a}}, note 17</ref> and the squire of [[Isildur]].<ref name=Gladden>{{UT|Gladden}}</ref>

==History==
Ohtar was apparently a [[Dúnedain of Arnor|Dúnadan of Arnor]]<ref name=Gladden/> and by the first years of the [[Third Age]] he was fully trained and experienced and had attained the rank of "Soldier".<ref name=GladdenNote/> He served as the squire of [[High King of the Dúnedain|High King]] [[Isildur]]<ref name=Gladden/> and was dear to him.<ref name=GladdenNote/>

He accompanied Isildur's retinue from [[Gondor]] to [[Arnor]], when they were ambushed by [[Orcs]] at the north borders of the [[Gladden Fields]]<ref name=Gladden/> on [[4 October]]<ref name=Gladden/><ref>{{App|Calendars}}, p. 1107</ref><ref>{{UT|7a}}, note 9</ref><ref group=note>The attack occurred on the thirtieth day of their journey from Osgiliath from which they departed on 5 September. Every month in the Númenórean 'King's Reckoning' consisted of thirty days.</ref> of {{TA|2}}.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2, p. 1085</ref> After the first ambush Isildur gave the shards of [[Elendil]]'s sword, [[Narsil]] and its sheath to Ohtar and ordered him to flee with one companion to save the shards at all cost.<ref name=Gladden/> Ohtar was one of only three survivors of the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]]<ref>{{FR|Council}}, p. 243</ref> and brought the shards of Narsil safely back to [[Rivendell]] in early {{TA|3}}.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 3, p. 1085</ref>

==Etymology==
''Ohtar'' is a [[Quenya]] word,<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-1936031863.html|articlename=Q. ''Ohtar'' m.|website=Eldamo|accessed=1 September 2023}}</ref> which means "warrior".<ref>{{UT|Index}}, entry ''Ohtar''</ref><ref>{{S|Index}}, entry ''Ohtar''</ref> It was the title of all fully trained and experienced soldiers who had not yet been granted the rank of ''roquen'' ("knight"). Ohtar was probably only his title and not his name and Isildur addressed him with this title at the tragic moment of handing him the shards of Narsil and the sheath to hide his feelings by using his formal title.<ref name=GladdenNote/>
