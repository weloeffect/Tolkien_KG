{{title}}
'''Farewell to Lórien''' is the thirty-fifth scene of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' and the forty-first of [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (extended edition)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (extended edition)]]. 

The scene was significantly longer in the extended edition, and featured a number of cuts between the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]] boating down the [[Anduin]] and receiving their [[Gifts of Galadriel|gifts]] and supplies from the [[Elves of Lorien|elves]]. As such, the exact sequence of events is not entirely clear.

==Synopsis==
As [[Galadriel]] rides in her swan boat, [[Celeborn]] and a group of elves garb the Fellowship in their specially-made [[Elven cloaks|cloaks]]. Celeborn claims that no outsiders have ever worn such garments, and prays that they will shield the wearers from "unfriendly eyes".

As the Fellowship loads their boats and prepares to leave, [[Legolas]] notices [[lembas]] among the supplies, and tells [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] that one bite can fill a grown man's stomach. When Legolas moves out of earshot, Merry, knowing [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] very well, asks how many lembas his friend had already eaten; Pippin replies "four", followed by an audible belch.

Under the shelter of the trees, Celeborn warns [[Aragorn]] of the dangers ahead - including the appearance of "strange creatures bearing the mark of the white hand" ([[Saruman]]'s [[Uruk-hai]]) - and warns that the Fellowship is being tracked. He also gifts Aragorn with a large, elven-made hunting knife.

As they paddle down the [[Anduin]], the members of the Fellowship recall the gifts presented to them by Galadriel: Legolas received a beautifully crafted [[Bow of the Galadhrim|bow]]; Merry and Pippin ancestral daggers; [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] a coil of [[Elven rope]], and [[Gimli]] — though it isn't clarified until later — three stands of [[Hair of Galadriel|Galadriel's hair]] to remember her by. Aragorn recalls the conversation he had with Galadriel regarding the choice currently before [[Arwen]]; to remain in [[Middle-earth]] or take the ship to [[Valinor]]. While Galadriel doesn't fully voice her thoughts on the matter, she reminds Aragorn that his own destiny as [[King of Gondor]] still awaits his choice, and bids him farewell with his true name, ''Elessar''. Finally [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] recalls his gift of the [[Phial of Galadriel|phial]] containing the light from the [[Star of Eärendil]], and sees Galadriel on the riverbank bidding them farewell.
