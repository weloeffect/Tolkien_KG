{{quote|And the house of Elrond was a refuge for the weary and the oppressed, and a treasury of good counsel and wise lore.|''[[The Silmarillion]]'', "[[Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age]]"}}

'''Rivendell''', or '''Imladris''', was an [[Elves|Elven]] outpost in the [[Misty Mountains]] on the [[Eastern Eriador|eastern edge of Eriador]]. Due to its location, it was called the '''Last Homely House''' from the point of view of a traveller going to the [[Misty Mountains]] and [[Wilderland]]; and also the '''First Homely House''' from the point of view of someone coming from these lands to the civilised lands of Eriador to the west.

It was established by [[Elrond]] in {{SA|1697}} as a refuge from [[Sauron]] after the [[Sack of Eregion|Fall of Eregion]].<ref name="SA">{{App|SA}}</ref> It remained Elrond's seat throughout the remainder of the Second Age and until the end of the Third Age, when he took the [[White Ship]] for [[Valinor]]. Rivendell had a strong alliance with the [[Kings of Arnor]] and after the fall of [[Arthedain]], it became a refuge for the [[Rangers of the North]] and the [[Heir of Isildur]].

==Geography==
[[File:Soni Alcorn-Hender - Valley of Rivendell.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Valley of Rivendell'' by [[Soni Alcorn-Hender]]]]
Rivendell was located at the edge of a narrow gorge of the [[Bruinen|Bruinen River]],<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref> but well hidden in the moorlands and foothills of the [[Misty Mountains]].<ref name="Rest">{{H|Rest}}</ref>

Pine-trees grew on the top of the valley, and there was a "steep zig-zag path" to the valley bottom. The vegetation in the valley bottom was mostly oak and beech.<ref name="Rest" />

==History==
===Second Age===
====Foundation====
During the [[War of the Elves and Sauron]], and as [[Sauron]] was moving against Eriador, Elrond led an army of [[Elves of Lindon]] to the region. They arrived late but were joined by a detachment out of [[Eregion]] led by [[Celeborn]]. Despite this, Sauron's armies overwhelmed the Elves, and Elrond was unable to reach Eregion. Forced northward toward the headwaters of [[Bruinen]], Elrond established a stronghold.<ref name="SA" />

This became a refuge for those seeking shelter from Sauron's onslaught in Eriador, and Elrond's and Celeborn's Elves were soon joined by many fleeing the [[Sack of Eregion]]. More came as Sauron ravaged Eriador on his march toward [[Lindon]]. By {{SA|1700}}, Sauron had overrun all of Eriador and Imladris was [[First Siege of Imladris|besieged]]. The siege ended when Gil-galad's forces, strengthened by the armament sent by [[Tar-Minastir]], routed Sauron's armies and drove him out of Eriador.

A Council held at that time made Elrond Gil-galad's vice-regent in Eriador, and Imladris his seat. Gil-galad bestowed [[Vilya]] upon Elrond in secret. Aided by the power of the [[Three Rings|Elven ring]], Elrond made Imladris one of the chief seats of Elvish strength in the west in the latter part of the Second Age. Imladris remained an Elvish stronghold in Eriador to the end of the Second Age and into the Third.<ref>{{UT|6}}</ref>

====Last Alliance====
At the end of the Second Age, [[Elendil]] and Gil-galad formed the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] to challenge Sauron, and their host halted for a while at Imladris in {{SA|3431}} and they stayed there for 3 years, gathered their forces before crossing the Misty Mountains.<ref name="SA" /><ref name="SV" /> 

[[Isildur]]'s wife and his youngest son, [[Valandil (King of Arnor)|Valandil]], were in Imladris at that time, and Isildur was journeying back to them after Sauron's defeat when he was ambushed at the [[Gladden Fields]].<ref>{{UT|7}}</ref> After receiving the shards of [[Narsil]], Valandil took up his role as King of [[Arnor]] and left Imladris for [[Annúminas]].<ref name="SV">{{S|V}}</ref>

===Third Age===
After the fall of Gil-galad, Elrond remained in Imladris. During the Third Age, it was a refuge and sanctuary; many Elves gathered there, and it was the chief dwelling of the [[High Elves]] in Eriador, except the [[Elves of Lindon]], but also wise and powerful people of all the races. Most of the Elves who lived in Rivendell were High Elves.<ref>{{RGEO|Notes}}, p. 64</ref> The [[Heir of Isildur|Heirs of Isildur]] were also harboured there due to their kinship with Elrond, as descendants of his brother [[Elros]].<ref name="SV" />

Danger came to Eriador around {{TA|1300}} when [[Angmar]] was established in the north-east beyond the [[Ettenmoors]]. It was late in the reign of [[Arveleg I]] that [[Second Siege of Imladris|Rivendell was besieged by Angmar]]. After an incursion by Angmar into Eriador in {{TA|1409}}, the Elves of Rivendell joined [[Elves of Lindon|those of Lindon]] and the [[Galadhrim]], whom Elrond brought over the Mountains, in subduing the power of the [[Witch-king]] for many years.<ref name="eriador">{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

After the end of the North-kingdom in {{TA|1975}} [[Aranarth]], the first [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain|Chieftain of the Dúnedain]], had [[Arahael|his son]] fostered in Rivendell, as were all subsequent sons of the chieftains. The heirlooms and treasures of the house of Isildur, including the shards of [[Narsil]], were also kept there after [[Arvedui]]'s death.<ref name="SV" /> Among these were also some of the few remaining documents containing the history of Númenor.<ref>{{UT|3}}</ref>
[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Riding down into Rivendell.jpg|thumb|200px|left|"Riding down into Rivendell" by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]]]
There was traffic across the Misty Mountains in the Third Age between Imladris and [[Lothlórien]], for Elrond's wife was [[Celebrían]], daughter of Galadriel and Celeborn.

In the [[Quest of Erebor]], [[Bilbo Baggins]] stopped off at Rivendell with the Dwarves on the way to the [[Lonely Mountain]]<ref name="Rest" /> and also on the way back to [[the Shire]] with [[Gandalf]].<ref>{{H|Stage}}</ref> Bilbo retired there after his 111th birthday, writing his memoir ''[[There and Back Again]]''.<ref name="Meetings">{{FR|II1}}</ref>
[[File:Abe Papakhian - Renewed Shall Be Sword that was Broken.jpg|thumb|''Renewed Shall Be Sword that was Broken'' by [[:Category:Images by Abe Papakhian|Abe Papakhian]]]]
Years later, [[Frodo Baggins]] and his [[Travellers|companions]] journeyed to Rivendell, where they met Bilbo. Several other Elves, [[Dwarves]] and [[Men]] had also arrived at Rivendell on separate errands;<ref name="Meetings" /> at the [[Council of Elrond]] they learned that all of their errands were related to the fate of [[the One Ring]], and they had to decide what to do about it. In the end, the Hobbits influenced the decision.<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref>

Following the destruction of [[the One Ring]] at the end of the Third Age, Elrond's ring lost its power, and Elrond, with many of his household, left Rivendell to sail for [[Valinor]] from the [[Grey Havens]]; this marked the start of the [[Fourth Age]]. 

===Later history===
Although Elrond departed from Rivendell, [[Elladan and Elrohir]] remained for a while with some of the remaining [[Noldor]].<ref name="Prologue">{{FR|Prologue}}</ref> It is believed that [[Celeborn]] also relocated to Rivendell after the departure of [[Galadriel]] and having also grown weary of [[East Lórien]].<ref name="Prologue" /><ref>{{App|Great}}</ref>

It is not known when Rivendell was finally abandoned, but shortly before [[Aragorn]] died in {{FoA|120}}, he said to [[Arwen]] that "none now walk" in the garden of Elrond, indicating that the last of the [[Noldor]] had departed to [[Valinor]].<ref name="Tale" />

==Etymology==
''Rivendell'' ("[[Wiktionary:cloven|cloven]]-[[Wiktionary:dell|dell]]") is the [[Westron|Common Speech]] translation of the [[Sindarin]] name '''''Imladris''''' ("deep dale of the cleft").<ref>{{HM|N}}, p. 774</ref> The name ''Imladris'' is also glossed as "flat-floored valley of the Cleft"<ref name="letter">[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], "[[Letter to Anthony D. Howlett]]" ([[Letters not published in "The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien"|unpublished letter]])</ref> but also simply as "Canyon of the Cleft".<ref>{{VT|47a}}, p. 14, note 18</ref>

The original Common Speech name of ''Rivendell'' was '''''Karningul''''' (itself a translation of ''Imladris'').<ref>{{App|F2}}</ref>

==Other names==
The [[Quenya]] name '''''Arcimbelë''''' is used only once in a manuscript, and its meaning is unclear except for the element ''[[imbë]]'' ("deep vale").<ref name="Verb">{{PE|22c}}</ref>{{rp|125}} A more literal translation is given: ''Latimberista'', from ''latimbë'' ("glen") + ''rista'' ("cut"). However, on the same page, Tolkien stated that this name was not used in practice, and was replaced the Quenyarized form of ''Imladris'': '''''Imbeláris'''''.<ref name="Verb" />{{rp|127}}

One of the names of the House of Elrond in Imladris was '''Mar Vanwa Tyaliéva''' ("House of Past (or Departed) Mirth") in Quenya.<ref>{{PE|21}}</ref>{{rp|80}} This name was retained from the earlier [[Cottage of the Lost Play]] found in the [[Book of Lost Tales]].

==Inspiration==
A possible inspiration (so suggested by [[David Salo]]<ref>Aaron Fuegi, "[http://scv.bu.edu/~aarondf/Rivimages/realriv.html Rivendell in Switzerland]" at [http://scv.bu.edu/~aarondf/home.html the Last Homely House] (accessed 15 November 2011)</ref>) could have been [[wikipedia:Lauterbrunnen|Lauterbrunnen, Switzerland]], which Tolkien visited in [[1911]]:

{{blockquote|I am... delighted that you have made the acquaintance of Switzerland, and of the very part that I once knew best and which had the deepest effect on me. The hobbit’s journey from Rivendell to the other side of the Misty Mountains, including the glissade down the slithering stones into the pine woods, is based on my adventures in 1911 (he was 19 and travelled to Lauterbrunnen)... Our wanderings mainly on foot in a party of 12 are not now clear in sequence, but leave many vivid pictures as clear as yesterday." (He talks of similar conditions of the travel of Bilbo camping out, walking mountain paths, carrying packs).|[[Letter 306]]}}
