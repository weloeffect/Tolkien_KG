'''Aldamir''' ([[Quenya|Q]]: "Tree-jewel", pron. {{IPA|[ˈaldamir]}}; {{TA|1330}}<ref name="Elendil">{{PM|Elendil}}, The Southern Line of Gondor: the Anarioni, 23. Aldamir</ref> - {{TA|1540}}<ref name="Aldamir">{{App|South}}, ''Kings of Gondor'', Aldamir</ref>) was the twenty-third King of [[Gondor]] ([[Castamir]] being counted the twenty-second).<ref>{{App|South}}, ''Kings of Gondor''</ref>

==History==
Aldamir was the younger son of [[Eldacar (King of Gondor)|Eldacar]],<ref name="Aldamir" /> but succeeded his father after the death of his father, because his brother [[Ornendil]] had been killed by an order from [[Castamir|Castamir the Usurper]] during the [[Kin-strife]],<ref name="Eldacar">{{App|Gondor}}, entry for king Eldacar</ref> in {{TA|1437}}.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1437</ref> Castamir later paid with his life for the killing of Ornendil, but the sons of the Usurper escaped and established an independent and hostile lordship in [[Umbar]].<ref name="Eldacar" />

Aladamir was killed during a war with the Harad and the Corsairs of Umbar.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1540</ref> He was succeeded by his son [[Vinyarion]]<ref name="Vinyarion">{{App|South}}, ''Kings of Gondor'', Hyarmendacil II (Vinyarion)</ref> in {{TA|1540}},<ref name="Aldamir" /> who defeated the Men of Harad in {{TA|1551}}<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1551</ref> and took the name Hyarmendacil II.<ref name="Vinyarion" />

==Etymology==
''Aldamir'' is a [[Quenya]] name. Its meaning is not glossed, but Paul Strack suggests that it means "Tree Jewel", from ''[[alda]]'' ("tree") and ''[[mírë]]'' ("jewel").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-1126937443.html|articlename=Q.

==Other verions of the legendarium==
A late manuscript of what would later become Appendix A also mentions that Aldamir was the third child of Eldacar, which implies that he also had a sister, that his brother Ornendil was killed in {{TA|1446}} and that Aldamir was killed in a war with rebelling kings of Harad that were allied with the rebels of Umbar.<ref name="Elendil" />
