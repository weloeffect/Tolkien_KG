'''Ælfwine''', also known as ''Wídlást'' ("Fartravelled"), and called by the [[Elves]] '''Ereol''', was the first [[Men|Man]] to find the [[Straight Road]] and visit [[Tol Eressëa]] after many millennia. 

Ælfwine came from a very early concept of Tolkien's to provide a "Narrator" for his work, and this concept changed greatly as the [[legendarium]] developed.

== History ==
Ælfwine son of [[Éadwine]] son of [[Óswine (grandfather of Ælfwine)|Óswine]] was born an [[Wikipedia:Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] around [[Seventh Age 869|869 AD]], living in [[Great Britain]] during the [[Wikipedia:10th century|10th century]]. When Ælfwine was nine years old, his father sailed off with his ship [[Éarendel]] and never returned.<ref>{{SD|2d}}</ref>

Because of the attacks of the [[Wikipedia:Danes|Danes]], his mother fled with him from [[Wikipedia:Somerset|Somerset]], where they lived, to [[Wikipedia:Cornwall|West Wales]], where she had her kindred.

He was a long way descendant of [[Eärendil]], and had, like all of Eärendil's descendants, [[sea-longing]] in his blood.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}</ref> He was a sailor and a minstrel. 

Having grown up to full manhood and learned the [[Welsh|Welsh language]] and much sea-craft he returned to Somerset to serve King [[Éadweard]]'s [[thain#Etymology|thegn]] [[Odda]] in the wars. In the service of Odda he sailed and visited both [[Wikipedia:Wales|Wales]] and [[Ireland]] many times. On his journeys he always sought tales of the sea, and thus came to hear the Irish legends of [[Wikipedia:The Voyage of Máel Dúin|Maelduin]] and [[Saint Brendan]], who both set out to sea, and came to "many islands in succession, where they encountered marvel upon marvel".<ref>{{HM|LR}}</ref> He heard also of a great land in the west which had been cast down. The survivors of the disaster had settled on Ireland and dwindled there; and the successors of these men all had the sea-longing in their blood, so that many sailed off west and never returned. Ælfwine thought he might be one of these descendants.

Around the year [[Seventh Age 914|914 AD]], in autumn, the Danes attacked [[Wikipedia:Porlock|Porlock]]. They were at first driven off and Ælfwine's company managed to capture a Danish [[Wikipedia:Knarr|cnearr]] at night. At dawn Ælfwine told his closest friend, [[Tréowine]], he intended to sail off westward, perhaps to the country of the legendary king [[Wikipedia:Sceafa|Sheaf]]. Tréowine agreed to accompany him at least as far as to Ireland. They got two other companions: [[Ceola]] of Somerset and [[Geraint]] of West Wales.

Many days after they passed Ireland the voyagers were exhausted. A "dreamlike death" seemed to come over them, and soon they passed out. The last that is known of the journey is that Tréowine saw the world plunge down under them, while sailing the [[Straight Road]].

When Ælfwine woke up, he found himself lying on a beach of [[Tol Eressëa]] and a group of [[Elves]] pulling up his ship on the shore. He came to [[Tavrobel]], where lived [[Pengolodh]] who told him the [[Ainulindalë]],<ref>{{HM|MR}}</ref> and he was shown the ''[[Lammas]]'',<ref>{{LR|Lhammas}}</ref> the ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', the [[Golden Book]],<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}</ref> the ''[[Narn i Chîn Húrin (tale)|Narn i Chîn Húrin]]'',<ref>{{WJ|Aelfwine}}</ref> and the [[The Annals of Aman|Annals of Aman]] and [[Annals of Beleriand|Beleriand]]. 

Ælfwine learned much of this lore. When he returned to England, he translated the Silmarillion, the Annals and the ''Narn'' into Old English, giving explanations on the many names.

Descendants of Ælfwine of the present time [[Atlantis-haunting|experienced memories or visions]] of their ancestors around the [[Downfall of Númenor|fall]] of [[Númenor#Inspiration|Atlantis]].

== Etymology ==
The name ''Ælfwine'' simply means "[[Elf-friend]]" in [[Old English]],<ref>{{SD|66}}, p. 235</ref><ref>{{HM|N}}, entry '''Elf-friend''', p. 756</ref> and is the equivalent of the names ''[[Elendil]]'' and of course ''[[Elfwine]]''. It is possibly intended as a cognate of ''[[Alboin]]'' and ''[[Alwin Lowdham|Alwin]]''.

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
Eriol has been a background figure in Tolkien's legendarium, being a [[Wikipedia:frame story|frame character]] to whom many texts are fictionally attributed. Ælfwine is a later version of a figure Tolkien first named as [[Ottor Wǽfre]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. Ælfwine/Eriol acquired lore from the Elves of Eressea, or translated existing Elvish works into [[Old English]]. Ælfwine is described as hailing from the north-west of England and his texts are in Tolkien's favourite dialect, the Mercian, a dialect which extended as far north as the Ribble Valley in Lancashire. 

As a literary device, Ælfwine/Eriol was intended as an in-universe explanation about the origin of the [[legendarium]]. On the other hand, ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' suggests that [[Bilbo Baggins]] is the originator of the narratives, through his [[Red Book]] and his [[Translations from the Elvish]] which he compiled in [[Rivendell]] (which supposedly included Elvish lore including the ''Ainulindale'' and the ''Quenta Silmarillion''). Ælfwine, or the idea of any real-world narrator or chronicler, may have been eventually abandoned in favor of this style of "in-character" narration by Bilbo and his role in the legendarium; even the name "Elf-friend" was given directly to him by [[Thranduil|King Thranduil]].

Still, in some of the writings of Tolkien written after ''The Lord of the Rings'', Ælfwine is still referred to and it is hinted that he may not have fully abandoned the idea of Ælfwine's translations, since the two frameworks (Red Book of Westmarch and Ælfwine) are not necessarily mutually exclusive.

Christopher Tolkien decided to remove all references of Ælfwine while compiling ''The Silmarillion'' since it could make the work too complex or complicated. However traces of Ælfwine's 'translations' remain, such as the archaic English 'translations' "[[Mickleburg]]" and "[[Nogrod|Hollowbold]]".
