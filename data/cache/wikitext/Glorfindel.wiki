{{Quote|Glorfindel was tall and straight; his hair was of shining gold, his face fair and young and fearless and full of joy; his eyes were bright and keen, and his voice like music; on his brow sat wisdom, and in his hand was strength.|''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', "[[Many Meetings]]"}}

'''Glorfindel''' was a [[Noldor|Noldo]] and one of the mightiest [[Elves]] of [[Middle-earth]]. During the [[First Age]], he was the lord of the [[House of the Golden Flower]] of [[Gondolin]], and died fighting a [[Balrog]]. After his re-embodiment, he was allowed to come back to Middle-earth in the [[Second Age]], acting as an emissary of the [[Valar]], on a similar mission to the [[Wizards|Istari]] who were to come several years later.

==History==
===Early history===
Glorfindel was born in [[Valinor]] sometime during the [[Years of the Trees]]. During the [[Exile of the Noldor]], he was of the host of [[Turgon]]. Glorfindel himself was reluctant; only for his allegiance and kinship with Turgon did he go, and had no part in the [[Kinslaying of Alqualondë]].<ref name="PoME-LW">{{PM|Last}}, "Glorfindel I & II"</ref>{{rp|380}}

===Life in Gondolin===
After the Return of the Noldor to [[Middle-earth]], Glorfindel's history is obscure. As a great follower of Turgon he was appointed chief of the [[House of the Golden Flower]], one of the [[Twelve houses of the Gondothlim|noble houses]] of [[Gondolin]]. He was dearly loved by all the [[Gondolindrim]].

[[File:Jenny Dolfen - Glorfindel and Ecthelion.jpg|thumb|left|''Glorfindel and Ecthelion'' by [[Jenny Dolfen]]]]
He followed [[Turgon]] who surprisingly came to fight in the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]. When the war turned against the [[Union of Maedhros|alliance]], Turgon's and [[Fingon]]'s forces retreated to the [[Pass of Sirion]] with Glorfindel and [[Ecthelion]] guarding their flanks.<ref>{{S|20}}</ref>

[[File:Ted Nasmith - Glorfindel's Bane.jpg|thumb|right|''Glorfindel's Bane'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
In the year {{FA|510}},<ref>{{WJ|Years}}, p. 351</ref> [[Morgoth]] sent a great force against Gondolin, resulting in the complete destruction of the city. The tale of this battle was well detailed in ''[[#Other versions of the legendarium|The Fall of Gondolin]]'', and long remembered by the elves. Glorfindel managed to escape the [[Fall of Gondolin]] with the [[Exiles of Gondolin|Exiles]], and after crossing [[Tumladen]] they reached the [[Cirith Thoronath]], a narrow pass between the mountains. There the survivors were attacked by an ambush of [[Orcs]] led by a [[Balrog]]. The [[Eagles]] came to help them, but Glorfindel fought the Balrog alone upon the pinnacle of a rock. Both died after falling in the abyss, and their duel is sung of by many songs. [[Thorondor]] rescued Glorfindel's body, and a cairn was raised, which remained there, covered by grass and yellow flowers, [[War of Wrath|until the world changed]].<ref>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>

===Re-embodiment and return to Middle-earth===
Glorfindel's spirit passed to the [[Halls of Waiting]], where he waited with the spirits of the other Noldor who had died during their war against [[Morgoth]]. But because of Glorfindel's noble actions in life, his reluctance at the Exile, and his furthering of the purposes of the Valar by saving Tuor and Idril, Manwë allowed his re-embodiment after only a short time. Being already an Elda of great corporal and spiritual stature, in his new incarnated life his spiritual power was enhanced by his self-sacrifice. He lived in Valinor for many years in the company of the Eldar and the [[Maiar]], the latter also regarding him as an equal, for he was incarnate. At some point, he became a follower of [[Olórin]], a Maia with special concern for Middle-earth.<ref name="PoME-LW" />{{rp|380–381}}

Eventually, [[Manwë]] sent him across the [[Belegaer|sea]] to [[Middle-earth]] during the [[Second Age]]. He possibly came as early as {{SA|1200}}, but more likely in {{SA|1600}},<ref name="PoME-LW" />{{rp|381–382}} at the same time as the [[Blue Wizards]].<ref>{{PM|XIII}}, "The Five Wizards", p. 384</ref> If he arrived in S.A. 1600, he arrived just after [[the One Ring]] had been forged, [[Barad-dûr]] built, and [[Celebrimbor]] dead or soon to be so. While the Blue Wizards were sent to the east, Glorfindel's mission was to aid [[Gil-galad]] and [[Elrond]] in the struggle against [[Sauron]].<ref name="PoME-LW" />{{rp|382}} He may have played a prominent behind-the-scenes role in the war in [[Eriador]] and the other struggles of the [[Second Age]] and [[Third Age]]. His part, though great, was mostly overlooked by the histories, because his immense, angelic power was not usually displayed openly.

===Third Age===
Over time, as the few remaining great Elves of Middle-earth took ship to Aman or fell one by one, only [[Galadriel]], [[Celeborn]], [[Elrond]], and [[Círdan]] were left of the Wise. Glorfindel took a more active role, leading the Elven forces in the [[Battle of Fornost]]. Upon the humiliation of [[Eärnur]] before the [[Witch-king]], Glorfindel bade him not pursue, and prophesied that the wraith would not fall by the hand of man.<ref>{{App|A1iv}}</ref> Not much can be said about his deeds and role in the events and struggles of the [[Westlands]] before the [[War of the Ring]].
[[File:Anke Eißmann - Glorfindel.jpg|thumb|''Glorfindel'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]
During the War, he was one of the elves dispatched from [[Rivendell]] by Elrond to search for the [[Ring-bearer]]. Elrond had chosen him partially because Glorfindel did not fear the [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]], as he had great presence in both the [[Seen]] and [[Unseen]] worlds. While on his perilous mission the Ringwraiths avoided him; he met five of them, and they fled at his presence. It was Glorfindel indeed who accomplished his mission and found the Ringbearer, [[Frodo Baggins]], and his friend [[Aragorn]] with him. Glorfindel put Frodo on his horse, [[Asfaloth]], and upon the approach of the Ringwraiths ordered him to go on. The white horse bore Frodo to safety across the [[Ford of Bruinen]], but Frodo, in a rash act of attempted heroism, turned around at the other side and defied the Nine. Glorfindel, expecting the flood that protected Rivendell to come down and smite the riders, revealed his power to the Riders, and drove them (willingly or not) into the River, where they were swept away by the ensuing waters.<ref name = "Flight to the Ford"></ref>

After this adventure, he helped bear Frodo to Rivendell, where the wounded Ringbearer was tended to. Glorfindel attended the [[Council of Elrond]], playing an active role in the conversation, speaking prophetically of [[Tom Bombadil]] and other matters with authority. Glorfindel stood beside Elrond and Gandalf as the backbone of the Council, laying out clearly their options. At first Glorfindel suggested that the Ring would be safe in the depths of the Sea, but the far-sighted Gandalf noted the change of landscapes, and the unforeseen possibilities that could bring the Ring forth once more in a hundred or even a thousand years in the future. He was briefly considered as a member of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], but as his friend Gandalf said, Glorfindel's power would be of little use against the might of [[Mordor]], on a mission of secrecy.<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref>

During the [[War of the Ring]] nothing is said of Glorfindel. Whatever his role, he survived and joined Elrond's company to the Wedding of Elessar.<ref>{{RK|Steward}}</ref> After that no more is said of him. Like Olórin, his task in Middle-earth was done, and the age of the [[Elves]] was over. He probably passed into the West, perhaps accompanying the bearers of the [[Three Rings]] and [[the One Ring]]. Or he may have remained in Middle-earth for some time to oversee the post-war recovery before eventually departing for [[Valinor]].

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Glorfindel.mp3|Ardamir}}
With the development of the [[Elvish]] languages, the name ''Glorfindel'' had different etymologies, ultimately meaning the same. 

The early [[Gnomish]] conception meant "Goldtress" or "Goldlocks". At this stage of the legendarium, [[Tolkien]] considered many other variants, like ''Glorfinn'' or ''Glorfing''.<ref>{{LT2|Appendix}}, entry "Glorfindel"</ref> [[Qenya]] cognates were '''''Laurifindl''''' or '''''Kulufindl'''''.<ref>{{PE|13}}, p. 104</ref>

At the [[Noldorin]] stage, the name was composed of the words ''[[glaur]]'' ("gold") + ''findel/finnel'' ("braided hair"),<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries "[[LAWAR]]", "SPIN"</ref> but it is not properly glossed.

In the final [[Sindarin]] conception, ''Glorfindel'' meant "Golden-hair", from ''glaur'' ("gold") + ''findel'' ("head of hair").<ref name="Eldarin">{{PE|17}}</ref>{{rp|17}} It was supposedly derived from the [[Quenya]] form '''''Laurefindelë'''''.<ref name="Eldarin" />{{rp|119}} Tolkien also created a [[Primitive Quendian]] version: ''Malaphindë'' ("Goldilocks"), which is mentioned as an ''[[anessë]]'' (a given name).<ref>{{PE|21}}, p. 86</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
===Early legendarium===
====''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''====
The most detailed text about the deeds of Glorfindel during the Fall of Gondolin is the chapter "[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]", in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales Part Two]]''. There he is described as the chief of the [[House of the Golden Flower]], who bore a rayed sun upon their shields. He wore a mantle embroidered in threads of gold, decorated with celandine "as a field in spring", while his arms were [[Uncommon words#D|damascened]] with "cunning gold".<ref name="Gondolin">{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|173}} 

Glorfindel witnessed the coming of [[Tuor]] and later the [[Fall of Gondolin]]. During the ensuing battle in the streets, Glorfindel chose (or was ordered) to hold the [[Great Market]] from the advancing [[Orcs]]. He attempted to flank them, taking the enemy by surprise, but was himself ambushed and surrounded. Cut off, the House of the Golden Flower fought on fiercely for hours, until a fire-breathing [[Dragons|dragon]] came and levelled their ranks. Glorfindel, with some of the strongest of his followers, cut his way out, but the survivors of that battle were very few. Even then they were pursued and might have all been killed, but the [[House of the Harp]] arrived in time, after rebelling from their treacherous leader [[Salgant]], ambushing their pursuers. The Golden Flower arrived at the [[Square of the King]], one of the last of the houses to be driven in.<ref name="Gondolin" />{{rp|182}} 

As many of the lords had fallen, [[Ecthelion]] was wounded, [[Galdor (elf of Gondolin)|Galdor]] was engaged, and [[Egalmoth]] had not yet arrived, Glorfindel joined Tuor in leading the defence of the King's Square. When Egalmoth arrived, bringing with him many women and children, he took over Glorfindel's job in going from place to place, strengthening the defences. Glorfindel presumably threw himself once more into the thick of the fight. But even he could not prevent a dragon from coming down from the [[Alley of Roses]], breaking through their lines. The dragon was accompanied by orcs and balrogs, among them [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]]. Even Tuor was thrown down, but Ecthelion sacrificed himself to kill Gothmog and buy the Gondothlim a little more time.<ref name="Gondolin" />{{rp|183–4}} After King Turgon ordered the survivors to follow Tuor, they fled southward, and Glorfindel held the rear manfully, losing many more of his House in the process.<ref name="Gondolin" />{{rp|186}}

After they had escaped Gondolin via [[Idril's secret way]], and passed through the [[Cristhorn]], Glorfindel again held the rear with the largest number of the unwounded. It was at that time that a Balrog and a contingent of Orcs ambushed their company.<ref name="Gondolin" />{{rp|192–3}} There Glorfindel saved the lives of the [[Exiles of Gondolin]] when he defied the Balrog:
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Glorfindel and the Balrog Above Gondolin.jpg|thumb|''Glorfindel and the Balrog above Gondolin'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]

{{blockquote|Then Glorfindel leapt forward upon him and his golden armour gleamed strangely in the moon, and he hewed at that demon that it leapt again upon a great boulder and Glorfindel after. Now there was a deadly combat upon that high rock above the folk; and these, pressed behind and hindered ahead, were grown so close that well nigh all could see, yet was it over ere Glorfindel's men could leap to his side. The ardour of Glorfindel drave that Balrog from point to point, and his mail fended him from its whip and claw. Now had he beaten a heavy swinge upon its iron helm, now hewn off the creature's whip-arm at the elbow. Then sprang the Balrog in the torment of his pain and fear full at Glorfindel, who stabbed like a dart of a snake; but he found only a shoulder, and was grappled, and they swayed to a fall upon the crag-top. Then Glorfindel's left hand sought a dirk, and this he thrust up that it pierced the Balrog's belly nigh his own face (for that demon was double his stature); and it shrieked, and fell backwards from the rock, and falling clutched Glorfindel's yellow locks beneath his cap, and those twain fell into the abyss.}}

The [[Noldoli]] still mourned the death of Glorfindel, and every time the [[Eldar]] saw a powerful fight between good and evil, they still said: "''Alas! 'Tis Glorfindel and the Balrog''". After the body of Glorfindel was recovered by Thorndor, Tuor allowed the folk of the Golden Flower to rise a cairn for him, there near the dangerous [[Thorn Sir]]. Despite being a unkindly place, yellow flowers grew upon the mound, and the place was always protected by Thorndor.<ref name="Gondolin" />{{rp|194}}

====''[[The History of The Lord of the Rings]]''====
In a hasty note about the Council of Elrond, Tolkien suggested that Glorfindel could tell of his ancestry in Gondolin, but this idea was never developed.<ref name="Ancestry">{{RS|1XI}}, p. 214</ref>

Glorfindel was originally planned to be part of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], in a way taking the place of [[Legolas]].<ref>{{RS|4XXIII}}, pp. 397-8, 406</ref>

===Later legendarium===
====''[[The War of the Jewels]]''====
While composing the chapter about [[Maeglin]], [[Tolkien]] considered Glorfindel, [[Ecthelion]] and [[Egalmoth]] as the escort of Aredhel when she left the [[Gondolin|Hidden City]] in her way to visit [[Fingon]].<ref name="Maeglin" />{{rp|318}} However, in the published ''[[Silmarillion]]'', [[Christopher Tolkien]] didn't mention any of the escorts of Aredhel, based on a note in which his father discussed about the motives of Celegorm and Curufin of not sending any message to Gondolin about Aredhel. Tolkien decided that it was necessary ''not'' to name the most eminent and bravest chieftains as Aredhel's escort, as they would have sought for her beyond the [[Iant Iaur]].<ref name="Maeglin">{{WJ|Maeglin}}</ref>{{rp|328}}

====''[[Last Writings]]''====
Tolkien first suggested that Glorfindel returned to Middle-earth about {{TA|1000}}, with [[Gandalf]].<ref name="PoME-LW" />{{rp|377}} But he later realized that Glorfindel only could come ''before'' the end of the Second Age and the [[Drowning of Númenor]], as with the [[Changing of the World]] Aman was removed from the [[Circles of the World]] and no living embodied creature could return from there. This was directly decreed by [[Ilúvatar]] to favour the [[Dominion of Men]]. It seems improbable that Manwë would have obtained special permission and devised a way of transportation, as that would seem to give Glorfindel an excessive importance.<ref name="PoME-LW" />{{rp|381–2}}

As told above, Glorfindel might have come as early as {{SA|1200}} and the years following, or as late as {{SA|1600}}. Although Tolkien declared the first to be possible, he favoured the last as the most probable.

==Portrayal in adaptations==
Glorfindel is rarely portrayed like in the book. In adaptations, there is usually not enough time to properly introduce a character that has little to do with the main plot. In the more popular works, his role has been filled by another Elf.

'''1971: [[Sagan om Ringen (1971 film)|''Sagan om Ringen'' (1971 film)]]:'''
:This short Swedish adaptation of the first half of the Fellowship of the Ring is unusual among film adaptations in that shows Glorfindel fight the Nazgûl rather than have another character absorb his role.

'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:In this adaptation, the role of Glorfindel was taken by [[Legolas]]. In a simplification of that character, and as a reason for ''his'' coming, he is portrayed as an Elf of Rivendell rather than [[Mirkwood]].

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:Glorfindel appears in his original role at the Last Bridge, voiced by [[John Webb]]. Because the part of [[Gildor|Gildor Inglorion]] was cut, the heavily wounded Frodo says the [[Quenya]] greeting ''[[Elen síla lúmenn' omentielvo]]'' to him, and Glorfindel replies with Gildor's answer. Glorfindel keeps his two [[Sindarin]] lines, ''[[A na vedui, Dúnadan!]]'' and ''[[Noro lim, noro lim, Asfaloth!]]'', though he says them with a heavy English accent. Glorfindel's role at the Council of Elrond is omitted.  His name is pronounced correctly in the adaptation, but in the credits, his name is pronounced "Glorfindle".

'''1988: ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien's War in Middle Earth]]'':'''
:Glorfindel is a powerful playable character once [[the One Ring|the Ring]] passes the [[Last Bridge]], who leads the Fellowship to [[Rivendell]].

'''1992: [[Der Herr der Ringe (1992 German radio series)|''Der Herr der Ringe'' (1992 German radio series)]]:'''
:Glorfindel is played by Stefan Schwartz.

'''1995: ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]'':'''
:Glorfindel appears in ''The Wizards'' expansion. He is named Glorfindel II, though is still intended to be the Glorfindel from The Fellowship of the Ring. The most likely explanation for this would be that the creator of the card was unaware that The Silmarillion's Glorfindel was the same character as the one that appears in Fellowship.

'''1996: ''J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit: An Adventure Play''''': 
:In this children's theater script by Edward Mast, the show opens with [[Bilbo Baggins]] putting on a shadow play for the audience of Glorfindel's battle with the Balrog at the Fall of Gondolin to establish his love of telling adventurous tales. The allure of having his own story just as adventurous, though hopefully with a less tragic end, plays a role in convincing Bilbo to join [[Thorin Oakenshield]]'s company.

'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:To limit the already large number of one-appearance characters, Glorfindel has been omitted in this adaptation as well. [[Peter Jackson]] decided to have [[Arwen]] meet the travellers and then ride on [[Asfaloth]].

'''2001: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of Glorfindel is provided by Marián Zednikovič.

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:Glorfindel appears on the Last Bridge. He has several Sindarin lines: ''A na vedui, Dúnadan'', like in the book, and ''Mae govannen, mellon'' (which Frodo accurately translates as "Well met, friend"). He comes to the aid of the hobbits at the request of Elrond, who had received news from [[Gildor|a group of Elves travelling near the Shire]] - even though there is no mention of that group earlier in the gameplay. Glorfindel does so in a monotonous voice, and his speech continues without pause. He also uses the lines ''Noro lim, Asfaloth'', though he does not say them to his horse: he says them to Frodo. No actor is specified for this part.

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:[[Decipher]] made two [[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game|cards]] featuring extra [[Jarl Benzon]] as Glorfindel, one of them being at the Coronation of Elessar.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://scrapbook.theonering.net/scrapbook/movies/characters/other/view/12658|articlename=Glorfindel's Cameo in ROTK!|dated=|website=TORN|accessed=15 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070323204416/http://www.decipher.com/content/2004/04/040504lotrwetafalconer.html|articlename=The Making of the Weta "Book Cards": An Interview With Weta Workshop's Daniel Falconer|dated=5 April 2004|website=Decipher.com (archived)|accessed=15 October 2013}}</ref>  He is briefly seen in the film at Aragorn's coronation when Arwen is revealed.

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:Glorfindel played an important part in this video game, set during the [[War of the Ring]]. Together with [[Glóin]] of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], Glorfindel fights in several places in northern [[Eriador]] and [[Rhovanion]]. He is voiced by [[Jason Carter]], and portrayed as white haired. His design was changed to a more movie-accurate version in the expansion pack, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king|The Rise of the Witch-king]]''. He serves as narrator throughout, and appears in the story itself after the death of [[Arvedui]].

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Glorfindel is featured in an extended flashback sequence depicting the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. During this time, he is the leader of the Bright Company, a group of [[High Elves]] who fighting to rid [[Middle-earth]] of [[Sauron]]'s evil long before that war and who continue their duty long after.
:In the present day, Glorfindel can be found in Rivendell just south of the [[Rivendell|Last Homely House]]. He is involved in the campaign against [[Angmar]] during the main story and also talks to the player after defeating the [[balrog]] Thaurlach. Glorfindel disappears in the final weeks of the [[War of the Ring]] and the player tracks him across Middle-Earth to summon him to the Council of Elf-Lords between [[Thranduil]], [[Celeborn]] and [[Galadriel]]. He joins the procession that escorts Lady [[Arwen]] to [[Minas Tirith]] for her wedding; along the way Glorfindel and [[Elrond]] assist [[Gandalf]] and the player in uncovering a mystery within the [[Gladden Fields]].

'''2012: ''[[Lego The Lord of the Rings: The Video Game]]'':'''
:Glorfindel is purchasable as an optional player character in DLC character pack 2 for use in free play and on the open world. He is portrayed with light tan hair (rather than yellow blond like Legolas), wears an outfit which is a mix of light blue robe parts and silver armour whilst wearing a light blue cape. He wields a bow of the Galadhrim and also carries a golden Elvish longsword (all Elvish longswords appear gold in the game). Glorfindel is one of the most proficient fighter characters in the game.

'''2022-24: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'':'''
:According to the showrunners, Glorfindel will make an appearance in a later season of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]''.<ref>{{webcite|author=Adam B.
