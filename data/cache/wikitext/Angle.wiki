The '''Angle''' in [[Eriador]] was the wedge of land between the rivers of [[Hoarwell]] and [[Bruinen|Loudwater]].<ref name="Earendur">{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain, p. 1040''</ref> It is not known how far north the area known as the Angle extended. 

==History==
The Angle was originally part of the realm of [[Arnor]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, p. 1039</ref> When the kingdom of [[Arnor]] was divided into the kingdoms of [[Arthedain]], [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]] after the death of King [[Eärendur (King of Arnor)|Eärendur]] in {{TA|861}},<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 861, p. 1085</ref> the Angle became part of the kingdom of Rhudaur.<ref name="Earendur" />

In {{TA|1150}} the [[Stoors]], a branch of the race of [[Hobbits]], crossed the [[Misty Mountains]] westward over the [[Redhorn Pass]] into [[Eriador]] and settled in the Angle or in [[Dunland]].<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1150, p. 1085</ref>

The [[Stoors]] only remained in the Angle for some two hundred years before they moved on again around {{TA|1356}},<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1356, p. 1086</ref> but at this point their kind divided. Some travelled west and north, and their descendants eventually merged with the other [[Hobbits]] of [[Bree]] and [[the Shire]]. Others returned across the [[Misty Mountains]] and travelled back down into the [[Vales of Anduin]].<ref name="Earendur" />

In the time of the [[Chieftain of the Dúnedain]] [[Arador]] many [[Dúnedain of the North]] lived in woods between the river [[Hoarwell]] and the river [[Loudwater]]. Arador lived in a house north of the [[Trollshaws]] in woods near the river [[Hoarwell]], which was threatened by a group of [[Trolls]].<ref>{{NM|P3xvii}}, note 12, p. 366</ref> It is possible that the Dúnedain lived in the Angle since it was protected by the river Hoarwell in the west, which could only be crossed below its sources at the [[Last Bridge]]<ref>{{FR|Flight}}, p. 200</ref> and the river Loudwater in the east and it was close to the elven refuge of [[Rivendell]] where the sons of the Chieftains of the Dúnedain were raised since [[Arahael]], the son of the first Chieftain [[Aranarth]],<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain, p. 1043''</ref> but it is not known when they moved there or how long they continued to live in the Angle.

It is possible that the hidden refuge in the wilds of Eriador in which the [[Dúnedain|Dúnadan]] [[Dírhael]] lived with his wife [[Ivorwen]] and his daughter [[Gilraen]] in the time of [[Arathorn II]]<ref name="Arwen">{{PM|Aii}}, manuscript A, p. 263</ref> was located in the Angle.
