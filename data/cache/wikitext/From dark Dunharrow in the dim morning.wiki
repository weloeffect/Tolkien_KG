"'''From dark Dunharrow in the dim morning'''" is a song written in [[Rohan]] of the ride of [[Théoden]] and his riders eastward to the aid of [[Gondor]].<ref>{{RK|Muster}}</ref> It is written in alliterative verse, meaning that, instead of rhyming, each verse has several words starting with the same sounds. This type of poetry was common among Germanic peoples, such as the Anglo-Saxons on whom the [[Rohirrim]] were based.

==Poem excerpt==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
From dark [[Dunharrow]] in the dim morning
with thane and captain rode [[Thengel]]'s son:
to [[Edoras]] he came, the ancient halls
of the Mark-wardens mist-enshrouded;
golden timbers were in gloom mantled.</poem>
