The '''White Council''', also referred to as the '''Council of the Wise''', was a gathering of the [[Wise]] in [[Middle-earth]]. At least two different Councils were known to have existed in the history of Middle-earth: one which met at least once after [[Sauron]] was driven out of [[Eriador]] in {{SA|1701}},<ref name="UTConcerning">{{UT|Concerning}}</ref> and another which first met in {{TA|2463}}<ref name="AppBTA"/> and went on to meet irregularly throughout the course of the [[Third Age]]. The purpose of the Council was "to unite and direct the forces of the [[Westlands|West]], in resistance to the shadow."<ref name="PMThird">{{PM|Third}}</ref>

==Members==
=== Second Age ===
No members are explicitly identified as being part of the first White Council during the [[Second Age]], however it is implied that at least [[Gil-galad]] and [[Elrond]] were members as Gil-galad gave [[Vilya]] to Elrond at the Council. [[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]] were present in [[Rivendell|Imladris]] at the same time as the Council, making them potential candidates as well.<ref name="UTConcerning"/>

=== Third Age===
The following individuals were clearly stated to have been members of the later iteration of the White Council during the [[Third Age]]: 
*[[Saruman]], the appointed leader of the Council
*[[Gandalf]]
*[[Galadriel]], who first summoned it
*[[Elrond]]
*[[Círdan]]
Other lords of the [[Eldar]] were said to have joined the Council at some point in time.<ref name="SRings"/>

==History==
A "White Council" first met in c. {{SA|1701}}.<ref group="note">In {{UT|Concerning}} it states that, "At this time the first Council was held". This followed the driving out of Sauron from [[Eregion]], which occurred {{SA|1701}} according to {{App|SA}}. According to {{UT|Concerning}}, note 10, "the first Council" was emended to "the first White Council".</ref> At this meeting it was decided that [[Rivendell|Imladris]] should become the stronghold of the [[Elves]] in [[Eriador]], rather than [[Eregion]]. It seems likely that the "White Council" of the [[Third Age]] echoed this "White Council" of the [[Second Age]].<ref name="UT|Concerning">{{UT|Concerning}}, p. 254, note 10</ref>

In {{TA|2063}}<ref name="AppBTA"/> [[Gandalf]] entered [[Dol Guldur]], thus daunting the concealed [[Sauron]] into fleeing [[east]]wards, beginning the [[Watchful Peace]]; although this was before the formation of the Council, the feat was attributed to them.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}, "...the Watchful Peace, during which Sauron withdrew before the power of the White Council..."</ref><ref group=note>The discrepancy is noted in {{HM|Guide}}, p. 424</ref>

In {{TA|2463}},<ref name="AppBTA"/> following Sauron's return to Dol Guldur and the end of the [[Watchful Peace]] in {{TA|2460|n}},<ref name="AppBTA"/> Galadriel summoned the first meeting of the White Council.<ref name=Mirror/>

There are only four known meetings of the White Council:<ref name="AppBTA"/>
* {{TA|2463}}: There were [[Saruman]], Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel and [[Círdan]], and other lords of the Eldar. It was mooted that Gandalf be the head of the Council, but to Galadriel's dismay he refused the office as he preferred his independence. Saruman was chosen as their chief instead, because of his deep knowledge on Sauron's devices, and he begrudged Gandalf for being the desired candidate.<ref name="SRings"/>

* {{TA|2851}}: The Council met at [[Rivendell]].<ref name="UTGandalf">{{UT|Gandalf}}</ref> The Grey Pilgrim urged an attack on [[Dol Guldur]] following his discovery in the [[Third Age 2850|previous year]] that its master was indeed the returned  [[Dark Lord]].<ref name="SRings"/> Gandalf also wished to simultaneously prevent a union between Sauron and [[Smaug]] - the [[Dragon]] that had sacked [[Erebor]] not long ago.<ref>{{UT|Erebor}}</ref> Saruman overruled him, however, because in secret he had begun to covet Sauron's power for himself.<ref name="AppBTA"/> The White Wizard thus insisted that there was no reason to attack the Dark Lord, claiming therefore that, the [[One Ring]] had fallen into the Anduin, and by now it had been flown to the [[Bay of Belfalas|Sea]].<ref group=note name=repetition>According to ''Of the Rings of Power'' Saruman makes this claim in the second meeting, and in ''Appendix B'', this argument is said in the last meeting; in the [[Council of Elrond]] this claim was "repeated what he had said to us before".</ref> In reality Saruman wanted to win himself some time, knowing that the Ring would sooner or later reveal itself if it felt the growing presence of its [[Lord of the Ring (title)|master]], Sauron; moving against him, it would make the Ring hide again.<ref name="SRings"/> Unusually for a White Council meeting, Gandalf sat apart from the others, in silence and smoking, whilst Saruman spoke against the attack on Dol Guldur. This irritated Saruman and he spoke to Gandalf afterwards, asking him why he did not join in the discussion, and mocked his smoking. Gandalf replied that [[pipe-weed]], a practice of the [[Hobbits|Halflings]], gave him 'patience'. Saruman mocked him again and in response Gandalf sent out many rings of smoke into the air and grasped them in his hand before they vanished. Saruman read this gesture as suggesting that Gandalf suspected him of wanting to possess the One Ring, or that there was a connection between the rings of power and the Halflings.<ref name="UTGandalf"/>

* {{TA|2941}}: Gandalf said that although the One Ring was lost, its existence alone allowed Sauron to still manifest - the Enemy, who now had the [[Nine Rings]] and three of the [[Seven Rings|Seven]] - and repeated his call to attack Dol Guldur.<ref name="SRings"/> Saruman finally conceded to the assault for he had been alarmed by Sauron's searching for the One Ring in the Anduin<ref name="AppBTA"/> and believed that thrusting him from Dol Guldur would allow him to search freely.<ref name="SRings"/> The White Council launched an [[attack on Dol Guldur]], but the Dark Lord, having already made plans, fled to [[Mordor]].<ref name="SRings"/><ref name="AppBTA"/>

* {{TA|2953}}: Following Sauron's open declaration in {{TA|2951|n}},<ref name="AppBTA"/> there was a discussion on the [[Rings of Power]]. Saruman once again repeated his claim that the One Ring had been lost down the [[Anduin]] and into the [[Belegaer|Sea]]<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref><ref group=note name=repetition/> this quieting Gandalf's worries about Bilbo's Ring. Afterwards, the Wizard retreated to [[Isengard]] and isolated himself from the others<ref name="SRings"/><ref name="AppBTA"/> and would be ensnared by the Dark Lord in {{TA|3000|n}}, becoming his power-lusting vassal.<ref name="AppBTA"/>

[[File:The Hobbit - An Unexpected Journey - The White Council.jpg|thumb|250px|The White Council meets in [[Rivendell]] in ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'']]
'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''
:Having arrived at [[Rivendell]] with [[Thorin and Company]], [[Gandalf]] found himself unexpectedly taken by [[Elrond]] to meet with [[Galadriel]] and [[Saruman]] at Saruman's behest. Whilst the meeting is not explicitly called the "White Council," its membership and discussion points have much in common with the White Council in [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s writings. Much of the history of the [[Third Age]] is conflated and substantially altered for the film; Gandalf reveals his concerns regarding an alliance between [[Sauron]] and [[Smaug]], before telling the Council that [[Radagast]] had found [[Dol Guldur]] occupied by a [[Sauron#Sauron's Return|Necromancer]]. Ever begrudging Gandalf, Saruman dismisses Gandalf for believing Radagast's story. Gandalf and Galadriel converse [[ósanwe|telepathically]] before the [[Wizards|Wizard]] shows the Council a [[Morgul-knife|Morgul blade]] which belonged to the [[Witch-king]]; the blade and the [[Nazgûl]] had been buried together many centuries previously following the downfall of [[Angmar]]. Saruman is still skeptical about the evidence and Radagast's claims and forbids Gandalf to continue his journey. However Gandalf had already arranged for [[Thorin and Company]] to leave Rivendell during the meeting, knowing already that Saruman would hinder him out of spite and pride.

'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''
:Gandalf has been imprisoned and tormented by Sauron and [[Keeper of the Dungeons|his minion]] after a failed mission to the stronghold of Dol Guldur. As Gandalf telepathically makes contact with Radagast, Galadriel arrives at the fortress to rescue him, vanquishing the [[Orcs|Orc]] jailor in the process. She and Gandalf are then surrounded by the spectres of the Nazgûl, but Elrond and Saruman arrive on the scene and attack them. Galadriel heals Gandalf while their companions battle the Nine. After Gandalf is swiftly taken to safety by Radagast, Sauron himself manifests before the council, forcing Galadriel to assume a dark, ethereal form in order to banish him, assisted by the power of [[Nenya]] and her [[Phial of Galadriel|phial]]. The [[Dark Lord]]'s spirit then flees into the East, which Elrond suggests should be kept under watch by [[Gondor]], who should be warned of the Enemy's return. Both awed and shaken by Sauron's display of strength, Saruman plays down on Galadriel and Elrond's worries, professedly vowing that he himself would deal with Sauron, and ultimately foreshadowing his later corruption.
