{{Quote|Next to Frodo on his right sat a dwarf of important appearance, richly dressed. His beard, very long and forked, was white, nearly as white as the snow-white cloth of his garments. He wore a silver belt, and round his neck hung a chain of silver and diamonds. Frodo stopped eating to look at him. 'Welcome and well met!' said the dwarf, turning towards him. Then he actually rose from his seat and bowed. 'Gloin at your service,' he said, and bowed still lower.|''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', "[[Many Meetings]]"}}

'''Glóin''' was a [[Dwarves|dwarf]] of [[Durin's Folk]], the son of [[Gróin]], the brother of [[Óin]], and the father of [[Gimli]] of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]].<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref>  He is most famous as one of [[Thorin]]'s companions on the [[Quest of Erebor|quest]] to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. 77 years after the Quest of Erebor,  Glóin attended the [[Council of Elrond]] with his son Gimli, where the latter would represent dwarves in the Fellowship of the Ring

==History==
Glóin was likely born in [[Dunland]], where the Dwarves of Durin's Line dwelt in exile<ref name="Durin"/> after their expulsion from [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] by the [[dragon]] [[Smaug]] in {{TA|2770}}.<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref>  Glóin was present at the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]],<ref name="Durin"/> which was odd because Dwarves were considered to be mere striplings in their thirties, yet at the time ({{TA|2799|n}}<ref name="TA"/>) Glóin was but 16 (his cousin [[Balin]] also was among the participants).  After the war, in which the dwarves were victorious,  Glóin returned to Dunland with the followers of Thorin, who then re-moved the dwarves to the [[Ered Luin]], the Blue Mountains, west of the [[Shire]].<ref name="Durin"/>

===Life in Thorin's Halls===
During Glóin's life in Ered Luin he saw the departure of King [[Thráin|Thráin II]], who tried to go back to [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], but was captured and tortured for the [[Ring of Thrór]], and subsequently died several years later.  Under King [[Thorin]], Glóin and the other Dwarves living in [[Thorin's Halls]] in the mountains became prosperous in a fashion and trafficked goods with other peoples, and gained what wealth they could. But ever they spoke of the [[Lonely Mountain]].<ref name="Durin"/> In {{TA|2879}}, Glóin has a son, [[Gimli]], who was considered too young to join [[Thorin and Company]] at the age of 62.

===The Quest of Erebor===
In {{TA|2941|n}} Thorin happened to meet [[Gandalf]] the Wizard.  From this meeting came Thorin's determination to return to the Lonely Mountain with a company of Dwarves, including Glóin, to seek revenge upon Smaug.  Gandalf came to a conclave of the Dwarves after visiting [[the Shire]] (but before seeing [[Bilbo Baggins]]) to persuade them to take the hobbit with them.  The Dwarves were skeptical, with Glóin calling them "simpletons" and claiming that one of them "would never dare to come within smelling distance of the nakedest dragonet new from the shell!"<ref>{{UT|Erebor}}, ''Extracts from the earlier version''</ref>

Glóin was the fifth Dwarf in the fourth group to arrive at [[Bag End]] for the Unexpected Party, and he came wearing a white hood.  Glóin did not assist in setting the table nor did he bring a musical instrument out when Thorin called for music.  After Bilbo had his fit of fright he overheard Glóin sneer that the hobbit looked "more like a grocer than a burglar" when he saw him "bobbing and puffing on the mat".  This affronted Bilbo enough to make him agree to undertake the quest.  Then, when Gandalf proclaimed that Bilbo was his choice he scowled at Glóin so fiercely that the dwarf huddled back in his chair, and later glaring at Bilbo.<ref>{{H|Party}}</ref>

On their quest Glóin was quite useful, especially at making fires, although on the night the company met the trolls, [[William]], [[Bert]], and [[Tom]], he and his brother failed to start one and began to fight, yet though first they quarreled.<ref>{{H|Mutton}}</ref>  On the night when the company came to the glade of the [[Wargs]], Glóin along with his brother, Dori, Nori and Ori secured a seat in a huge pine tree.<ref>{{H|Pan}}</ref>  At [[Beorn]]'s home Glóin and Óin were the fifth pair of Dwarves to appear as Gandalf spun their tale.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>  And when released from his barrel near [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]], Glóin was one of the Dwarves who was waterlogged and seemed but half alive, and needed to be carried ashore.<ref>{{H|Welcome}}</ref>

Glóin fought in and survived the [[Battle of Five Armies]].  He was given his share of the treasure by [[Dáin Ironfoot]], who became King after Thorin's death. Glóin settled in the Lonely Mountain, along with the survivors of the battle, and would grow wealthy in Erebor under the leadership of King Dáin.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

===War of the Ring===
In October {{TA|3018}}<ref>{{App|Great}}</ref> Glóin and his son [[Gimli]] were sent by [[Dáin Ironfoot]] to [[Rivendell]] to seek advice concerning the fate of [[Balin's Colony]] in Moria.  When [[Frodo Baggins]] recovered from his wounds and attended the feast, it was Glóin who sat next to him and gave him the news from Erebor and surrounding lands since the time of Bilbo.<ref name="Meetings">{{FR|II1}}</ref>  Later, at the [[Council of Elrond]], Glóin spoke of the shadow that had fallen upon his people, Balin's expedition and of the sinister messenger from [[Mordor]] who had come to inquire about [[Hobbits]] and where they dwelt.<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref> Glóin's greatest contribution to the [[War of the Ring]] was his son Gimli, who joined the [[Fellowship of the Ring]].<ref>{{FR|II3}}</ref>

It is possible that Glóin fought in the [[Battle of Dale]] against the [[Easterlings]] during the [[War of the Ring]], for he lived until {{FoA|15}}.<ref name="Durin"/> After the War of the Ring it is unknown whether he saw Gimli again after he explored [[Fangorn Forest]] and the [[Glittering Caves]].

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In both the early manuscript of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and in the published version, Glóin had heard of Bilbo's great-great-great-grand-uncle [[Bandobras Took|Bullroarer Took]], who accidentally invented the game of Golf.  However, only in the early manuscript it was mentioned that Glóin was very fond of golf.<ref>{{HH|Bladorthin}}, p. 40</ref>

In ''The Fellowship of the Ring'', the dwarf [[Burin]] (also [[Frár]]), being Balin's son (from Thorin and Company) was suppose to accompany Glóin to the [[Council of Elrond]], and that would later join [[The Fellowship of the Ring]], though it was changed to Gimli, and also changed to be Glóin's son, in the final draft of the novel.<ref>{{RS|Elrond}}</ref>
