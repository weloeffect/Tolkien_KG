'''Óin''' was one of the [[Dwarves]] of [[Thorin and Company|Thorin's company]] who set out to reclaim [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] from [[Smaug]]. Later, he followed [[Balin]] in an ill-fated attempt to retake [[Moria]].

==History==
Óin was the son of [[Gróin]] and older brother of [[Glóin]], both of the [[House of Durin]].<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref>

===The Quest of Erebor===
Óin was one of the five Dwarves in the fourth group to arrive at [[Bag End]]. He wore a brown hood.<ref name = "An Unexpected Party"></ref>

Óin and Glóin were noted for their ability to start fires, although both failed on the night that the company met the [[trolls]]. In their frustration they began to quarrel and eventually to fight, which was the incident that prompted the company to head for the fire seen far off on a hill.<ref>{{H|Mutton}}</ref>

In the glade where the wolves came to gather, Óin was one of five Dwarves who climbed up to fairly comfortable seats in a huge pine tree.<ref>{{H|Pan}}</ref>

When [[Gandalf]] was telling the story of the company's adventures to [[Beorn]], Óin and Glóin were the fifth pair of Dwarves to show up.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>

Óin fought in and survived the [[Battle of Five Armies]]. He was given his share of the treasure by [[Dáin Ironfoot]], and made his home in Erebor.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

===Expedition to Moria===
In {{TA|2989}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> Óin had followed Balin with a [[Balin's folk|company]] of Dwarves in an attempt to reclaim their ancient mansions of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], which were occupied by [[Orcs]].<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref> At first the colony did well, but on [[November 10]], {{TA|2994|n}} Balin was killed, and the Orcs returned. They took the [[Great Gates|East-gate]]/[[First Hall]] then the [[Second Hall]] after a [[Battle of the Second Hall|fierce battle]] which Óin likely fought in.

Óin went with a party to find escape via the [[Doors of Durin|West-gate]] but they found the water up to the doors and he was taken by the [[Watcher in the Water]]. Of his party only four returned five days after they had left, and soon thereafter all the remaining colonists were killed in a [[Last stand of Balin's folk|final stand]] in the [[Chamber of Mazarbul]].<ref>{{FR|II5}}</ref>

Their fate was unknown to their kinsmen and their silence was largely why [[Glóin]] and [[Gimli]] went to [[Rivendell]] at that time, to seek news from [[Elrond]]. When [[Frodo Baggins]] came to Rivendell, Glóin delighted in telling him about the doings of the renewed dwarf-kingdom. But when Frodo asked about Óin, Balin, and Ori, Glóin's face darkened and he said that he did not know.<ref>{{FR|II1}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Oinn'' is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. His name means "Shy".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

:Óin was portrayed by [[John Callen]].<ref name="PJCasting">{{webcite|author=[[Peter Jackson]]|articleurl=http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150168211921558|articlename=Production begins in New Zealand on The Hobbit|dated=20-March-2011|website=[http://www.facebook.com/ Facebook]|accessed=23-Dec-2011}}</ref> A description of Óin in ''The Hobbit'' films was released by the studio:

:{{Blockquote|Along with his brother Gloin, Oin is a distant cousin of Thorin Oakenshield. A brave [[Longbeards|Northern Dwarf]], Oin joins [[Thorin and Company|The Company of Thorin Oakenshield]] out of a sense of loyalty to his kin, and also because he has a substantial sum of money invested in the venture. Well read with an enquiring mind, Oin is the healer among the Company, often applying an herbal salve of his own invention – which has since come to be known as ‘ointment’ after its maker.|[[Warner Bros.]]<ref name="HobbitApp">{{webcite|author=[[Warner Bros.]]|articleurl=http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hobbit-movies/id545808528|articlename=Hobbit Movies|dated=7-September-2012|website=[http://itunes.apple.com/ Apple iPhone/iPad App]|accessed=19-September-2012}}</ref>}}
:Perhaps the oldest of the thirteen Dwarves after Balin, Óin is also hard of hearing, as he carries an ear trumpet. When the company was captured in [[Goblin-town]], the ear trumpet got trodden upon by a [[Orcs|Goblin]], though Óin was mostly able to bend it back into its original shape after their escape. Due to the fact that he was the group's de facto medicine man, he opts to stay behind in [[Lake-town]] along with [[Fíli]] to look after [[Kíli]] when [[Thorin]] deems him too ill to accompany the group on the final leg of their quest up to the Lonely Mountain due to having been struck by a poisoned arrow. Óin is in awe of [[Tauriel|Tauriel's]] Elvish healing powers when she ultimately heals Kíli's wound with [[Athelas|a''thelas'']]

:The companion book ''The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey: A Visual Companion'' adds that Óin acted as a midwife among the dwarves. Among the infants he delivered was his nephew Gimli, though rumor suggests that Gimli slipped from the grip of his uncle and landed on his head.

'''2008: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Óin appears in an extended flashback depicting the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]], in which he fights alongside his father and the rest of [[Farin|Farin's]] kin.
:The game took advantage of the exact wording of the [[Book of Mazarbul]] and rather than having the [[Watcher in the Water]] killing Óin outright, it took him to [https://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/The_Drowned_Treasury Ghân-gharâf] within the [https://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/The_Water-works Water-works] of [[Moria]]. There, Óin discovered the legendary [[Mithril]] axe [https://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/Zigilburk Zigilburk] and used it to keep the Watcher in the Water at bay until he eventually succumbed to hunger. In the present day, the same happens to [[Bofur|Bofur's]] grandson [https://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/Bróin Bróin] of the [https://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/Iron_Garrison Iron Garrison]. Bróin and Zigilburk are eventually discovered by the player, allowing the dwarves to pay proper respect to Óin's remains.
