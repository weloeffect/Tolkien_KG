'''Beorn''' was a son of a [[Men|Man]] named [[Heden]], according to the early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''.<ref name="Beo"/>

Beorn was noted for the murder of his brother [[Eoh]], the father of [[Eriol]],<ref name="Beo">{{LT1|In}}, pp. 23-4</ref> who died either "in the siege" of his town or "in a great battle".<ref name="Has"/>

Many years later, Beorn himself was killed by [[Hengest]] and [[Horsa]], Eoh's grandsons, in an act of vengeance.<ref name="Has">{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''10''', p. 290</ref>

== Etymology ==
The name ''Beorn'' is in [[Old English]]. It means "warrior", but its original meaning was "bear".<ref name="Beo"/> 

== Other names ==
Another variation of his name was ([[Gothic]]) '''''Bernus''''', which was probably intended as a form of ''baírnus'', a Gothic equivalent of the name, with [[Tolkien]] changing the spelling from ''aí'' to ''e''.

In [[Qenya]] he was called '''''Veran''''' or '''''Verain''''', with the name '''''Beren''''' being its [[Gnomish]] cognate.<ref name="Ber">{{PE|15}}, "[[Names and Required Alterations]]", Appendix, ''Text IX'', pp. 16-7</ref><ref group="note">The reading of ''Beren'' is uncertain. An alternative reading might be '''''Berin''''' instead.</ref>

The name ''Veran'' itself was changed from ''Verus'', an earlier name.<ref name="Var"/>

Another (Old English) name for the character was '''''Hasen''''' of Isenóra ("iron shore").<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, p. 291</ref>

<nowiki>*</nowiki> The name of Hendwine's mother is not Naimi but ''[[Nelmir]]'' in the text on which the basis of his inclusion is founded upon - neither is her relation to [[Lindo]] and [[Vairë (wife of Lindo)|Vairë]] elaborated on.<ref name="Var">{{PE|15}}, "[[Names and Required Alterations]]", Appendix, ''Text X'', p. 17</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In an early, rejected sketch, a more elaborate version of events is given, in which Beorn attacked his brother's castle and killed him, and took Eriol captive - from which Eriol eventually escaped.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, p. 294</ref>
