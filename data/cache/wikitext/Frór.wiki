'''Frór''' ({{TA|2552}} - {{TA|2589|n}}, aged 37 years) was a [[Dwarves|dwarf]] of [[Durin's folk]] and the second son of King [[Dáin I]].

==History==
During his short life his people lived in the [[Grey Mountains]], where they were threatened by and at [[War of the Dwarves and Dragons|war]] with [[Dragons]]. In 2589 both Frór and his father were killed by a great [[Cold-drakes|Cold-drake]] outside their [[Dáin's Halls|hall]].

Frór's older brother [[Thrór]] then became [[Kings of Durin's Folk|King of Durin's Folk]] and led part of his house back to [[Lonely Mountain]]. The rest of those who left traveled East to the [[Iron Hills]] with the youngest brother [[Grór]], who founded his own [[Dwarves of the Iron Hills|realm]].<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>
