'''Frumgar''' was a chieftain of the [[Éothéod]] who led his people from the middle to the northern [[Vales of Anduin]].<ref name=Frumgar/> It is possible that Frumgar was the fourth [[Lord of the Éothéod]] and the grandson of [[Forthwini]].<ref>{{webcite|author=Michael Martinez|articleurl=https://middle-earth.xenite.org/how-many-lords-of-eotheod-were-there/|articlename=How Many Lords of Éothéod Were There?|dated=10 October 2013|website=middle-earth.xenite.org|accessed=20 February 2022}}</ref>

== History ==
Before {{TA|1977}} the [[Éothéod]] lived in the middle vales of Anduin between the [[Carrock]] and the [[Gladden Fields]] with most of them living on the west side of the river [[Anduin]].<ref>{{UT|Northmen}}, second paragraph</ref> At that time many men lived in the middle vales of Anduin and the shadow of [[Dol Guldur]] was lengthening.<ref name=Eorl>{{App|Eorl}}, first paragraph, p. 1064</ref>

In {{TA|1975}}<ref name="ReferenceA">{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1975, p. 1086</ref> the evil [[Angmar|Kingdom of Angmar]] was [[Battle of Fornost|destroyed]]. The Éothéod heard of the destruction of Angmar,<ref name=Eorl/> probably because some of them had fought with their horses with the expeditionary force from [[Gondor]] in [[Arthedain]] against the troops from Angmar<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry for king Eärnil II, p. 1050</ref> in {{TA|1975}}<ref name="ReferenceA"/>. As a consequence, Frumgar, then the chieftain of the Éothéod, led the Éothéod,<ref name=Frumgar/> who sought more room, to the North and drove away the remnants of the people of Angmar on the east side of the [[Misty Mountains]]<ref name=Eorl/> in {{TA|1977}}<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1977, p. 1087</ref>.

The Éothéod settled in the land between the [[Misty Mountains]] on the west, the [[Forest River]] in the east and the confluence of the rivers [[Greylin]] and [[Langwell]] in the south.<ref>{{UT|Ride}}, second paragraph</ref> The only fortified ''burg'' of the Éothéod was located at the confluence of the Greylin and the Langwell.<ref>{{UT|Ride}}, third paragraph</ref> It is possible that this ''burg'' was the settlement known as [[Framsburg]]<ref>{{webcite|author=Daniel Helen|articleurl=https://www.tolkiensociety.org/2015/11/tolkiens-annotated-map-of-middle-earth-transcribed/|articlename=Tolkien's annotated map of Middle-earth transcribed|dated=10 November 2015|website=tolkiensociety.org|accessed=20 February 2022}}</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=Michael Martinez|articleurl=https://middle-earth.xenite.org/what-was-eotheod-like/|articlename=What Was Éothéod Like?|dated=7 December 2011|website=middle-earth.xenite.org|accessed=20 February 2022}}</ref> and that it was named after Frumgar's son, [[Fram]].<ref>{{HM|RC}}, entry ''Framsburg'', p.

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
'''2020: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Frumgar appears in a flashback narrating the history of the [[Éothéod]]. He is shown befriending [[dwarves]] and [[Wizards]] at a young age, and his decision to move his people to the Wells of [[Langflood]] is partially motivated by his wife being killed in an [[Orcs|Orc]] raid. It was he who gave [[Gandalf]] his northern name by calling him Wandalb, "the Elf of the Wand".
