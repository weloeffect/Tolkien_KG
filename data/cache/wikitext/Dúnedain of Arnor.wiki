The '''Dúnedain of Arnor''', also known as the '''Dúnedain of the North''' or the '''Northern Dúnedain''', constituted the ruling class and nobility of [[Arnor]] being descendants of the [[Exiles of Númenor]] who established the North-Kingdom. 

"'''Men of Arnor'''" was a term used to define the inhabitants of Arnor and its successor kingdoms, both of Númenorean and non-Númenorean descent. The history of the Men of Arnor is extensively dominated by the actions of the Dúnedain of the North. 

==History==
===Foundation===
After the [[Downfall of Númenor]], the [[Exiles of Númenor]], led by [[Elendil]], established the [[Realms in Exile]] of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]]. After passing up the River [[Lhûn]] and into [[Eriador]], he established the realm of [[Arnor]].

The Exiles dwelt throughout [[Eriador]], especially along the [[Lhûn]] and the [[Baranduin]]; but their "chief city was at [[Annúminas]] beside Lake [[Nenuial]]. At [[Fornost]] upon the [[North Downs]] also the Númenóreans dwelt, and in [[Cardolan]], and in the hills of [[Rhudaur]]; and towers they raised upon [[Emyn Beraid]] and upon [[Amon Sûl]]".<ref name=rings>{{s|Rings}}</ref>

The Men of Arnor were always less powerful and populous than the [[Gondorians]], despite them having precedence over their southern kin as the seat of the [[High King (Dúnedain)|High King]].<ref>{{PM|Atani}}</ref>

===Decline===
Originally ruled by their [[High King (Dúnedain)|High King]], the Dúnedain in Arnor became a separate entity from their [[Dunedain of the South|southern kin]] following the death of [[Isildur]], son of [[Elendil]], in {{TA|2}}.<ref name=rings/><ref name="AppB">{{App|B2}}</ref> 

When [[Valandil (King of Arnor)|Valandil]], [[Isildur]]'s youngest son, took up his rule in [[Annúminas]], the Men of Arnor were diminished; there were too few Númenóreans and [[Men of Eriador]] to populate and maintain the land developed and built by the [[Exiles of Númenor|Exiles]]. This is because many Men of Arnor had died in the [[War of the Last Alliance]] and at the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]].<ref name=rings/>

After the reign of [[Eärendur]], the Dúnedain of the North became divided into the petty realms of [[Arthedain]], [[Cardolan]], and [[Rhudaur]], owing to dissensions among his sons.<ref name=rings/><ref name=eriador>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

===Conflicts with Angmar===
{{main|Angmar War}}
In c. {{TA|1300}}, the realm of [[Angmar]], ruled by the [[Witch-king]], was established beyond the [[Ettenmoors]] with the purpose of destroying the divided Dúnedain of the North.<ref name=eriador/>

During the reign of [[Argeleb I]], the [[House of Isildur]] had failed in the other kingdoms and so, the [[Kings of Arthedain]] claimed the lordship of all the Northern Dúnedain. This claim was resisted in [[Rhudaur]]; there, the [[Dúnedain]] were few, and a lord of the [[Hill-men]], whose allegiance secretly lay with Angmar, had seized power.<ref name=eriador/>

A great host came out of Angmar in {{TA|1409}} and entered [[Cardolan]], besieging the [[Tower of Amon Sûl]]. The Dúnedain were defeated and Arveleg I, as well as the last prince of Cardolan, were slain. Henceforth, Rhudaur was occupied by evil men allied with Angmar, and the Dúnedain that remained there were killed or fled west. Although Cardolan was destroyed, a remnant of the Dúnedain there held out in the [[Barrow-downs]] and others took refuge in the [[Old Forest]].<ref name=eriador/>

Although the northern parts of [[Arthedain]] were little affected, the Dúnedain were affected by the [[Great Plague]]; the joint garrison (of the North and South Kingdoms) at [[Tharbad]] ceased to exist,<ref>{{UT|6d}}</ref> and the last of the Dúnedain of Cardolan died.<ref name=eriador/>

In {{TA|1974}}, the [[Witch-king]], with his army from Angmar, invaded Arthedain and captured [[Fornost Erain]], driving most of the Dúnedain over the [[Lhûn|Lune]].<ref name=eriador/> The remnants of the Men of Arnor later joined the great [[Host of the West (Arnor)|Host of the West]] which overthrew Angmar.<ref name=gondor>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

===Later History===
{{main|Rangers of the North}}
After the [[Angmar War]], all the people of [[Arnor]] were diminished.<ref name=eriador/> The Dúnedain of the North were reduced to a few [[Ranger of the North|Rangers]] wandering secretly in the wild, and their heritage was forgotten. It was only in [[Rivendell|Imladris]] where they were remembered and it was there that the [[Heir of Isildur|Heirs of Isildur]] were harboured.<ref name=rings/><ref name=eriador/>
[[File:Anke Eißmann - The Lady's gift.jpeg|thumb|''The Lady's gift'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]
By the time of the [[War of the Ring]], [[Halbarad]], a kinsman of [[Aragorn]], mustered 30 Dúnedain, and this [[Grey Company]] rode to the aid of [[Aragorn]] in [[Rohan]] and went on to fight in the [[War of the Ring]] as representatives of the fallen Northern Dúnedain.<ref name="Grey"/>

Upon the reunification of the [[Kingdoms of the Dúnedain]] after the [[War of the Ring]], the Dúnedain were [[Reunited Kingdom|reunited]] under [[Aragorn II Elessar]], [[Isildur's Heir]], and their glory was restored.<ref name=rings/>

==Population==
The Dúnedain of Arnor, unlike their [[Gondorians|kin to the South]], were of unmingled [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] blood.<ref name=blood>{{VT|42a}}, pp. 11-3</ref> By the time [[Hobbits]] entered [[Eriador]] in the mid-[[Third Age]], Men were still numerous: [[Dúnedain|Númenóreans]], Men akin to the [[Edain]], and evil Men hostile to the [[House of Isildur]].<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, #59</ref>

In [[Arnor]], the native [[Men of Eriador]] accepted the Númenórean kingdom and helped to populate and maintain the places that the [[Exiles of Númenor]] initially built. When [[Elendil]] led the Men of Arnor to battle against [[Sauron]], the [[Men of Eriador]] fought alongside the [[Dúnedain]]. After the [[War of the Last Alliance|War]], many of these Men perished in battle and their population became diminished.<ref name=rings/>

The [[Men of Bree]], akin to the [[Dunlendings]], also became subjects of the [[North-kingdom]].<ref name=languages>{{App|Men}}</ref>

==Characteristics==
===Physical Description===
The Dúnedain of Arnor were tall, pale-skinned, with dark hair, shining grey eyes, and proud faces. They were taller and darker than the [[Men of Bree]].<ref name="Sign">{{FR|Sign}}</ref> The [[Grey Company|Rangers that followed Aragorn]] were described as being stout and lordly men in comparison to the [[Rohirrim]].<ref name="Grey"/> 

The [[Dúnedain]], including those of [[Arnor]], were lords of long life, great power, and wisdom; far superior to the [[Middle Men|Men of Middle-earth]] among whom they dwelt and whom they ruled. They were from the beginning far fewer in number than the [[Middle Men|lesser men]].<ref name=languages/>

===Lifespan===
In the beginning of their history, the [[Dúnedain]] were blessed with a lifespan thrice the life of [[Middle Men|lesser men]], yet this ever-diminished over the course of the [[Third Age]].<ref name=eriador/><ref name=languages/> "More swift was the waning in the [[Arnor|North-kingdom]], for [[Eriador]] became colder and there, the [[Dúnedain]] became ever less".<ref>{{PM|Third}}, p. 227</ref>

In [[Arnor]], the strife and dissensions between the kingdoms of [[Arthedain]], [[Cardolan]], and [[Rhudaur]] hastened the waning of the Dúnedain. Although, their lifespans ever-continued to shorten, the Dúnedain, especially the [[Chieftain of the Dúnedain|Chieftains of the Dúnedain]], maintained significant longevity living to twice the age of [[Middle Men|lesser men]].<ref name=eriador/><ref>{{PM|Second}}</ref> The [[Heir of Isildur|Heirs of Isildur]] even lived up to 160 years or more.<ref name=Tale/>

Even upon the reunification of the [[Kingdoms of the Dúnedain]], the life-span of all Dúnedain, even those of [[Arnor]], was not restored and continued to wane until it became as that of other men.<ref name="Elendil">{{PM|Elendil}}</ref>

==Culture==
===Skills and Customs===
The Dúnedain were a martial folk, even considered great warriors in their decline as [[Théoden]] noted that the skill of the [[Grey Company]] could not be expressed by their numbers.<ref name="Grey">{{RK|V2}}</ref> 

The Rangers were believed to have strange powers of sight and hearing, and to understand the language of beasts and birds.<ref name="Sign"/>

The [[Heir of Isildur|Heirs of Isildur]], being men of long life, were "not accustomed to wed until they had laboured long and journeyed in the world".<ref name=Tale>{{PM|Aii}}, p. 263</ref> For women, the age of 22 is considered too early, according to the customs of the Dúnedain, to be wed.<ref name="Av">{{App|Tale}}</ref>

===Languages===
[[Westron]] was the native language of the people of [[Arnor]].<ref name=lang>{{App|F1}}</ref> Among the [[Dúnedain]] however, including those of [[Arnor]], "the kings and high lords, and indeed all those of [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] blood in any degree," for long used [[Númenórean Sindarin|Sindarin]].<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, p. 34</ref> [[Quenya]] was known to the learned of [[Arnor]], a tradition which has continued from the loremasters of [[Númenor]], to be used for places of fame and reverence in addition to the names of royalty and men of great renown.<ref name=languages/> All the royal names of the [[Kings of Arnor]] were [[Quenya]] names. The [[Kings of Arthedain]] and later the [[Chieftain of the Dúnedain|Chieftains of the Dúnedain]], however, took [[Sindarin]] names.<ref name=North>{{App|North}}</ref>
