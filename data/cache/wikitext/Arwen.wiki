{{quote|[[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] saw her whom few [[mortals]] had yet seen; '''Arwen''', daughter of [[Elrond]], in whom it was said that the likeness of [[Lúthien]] had come on earth again; and she was called [[Undómiel]], for she was the Evenstar of her people.|''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', "[[Many Meetings]]"}}

'''Arwen Undómiel''', often called '''Arwen Evenstar''', was one of the [[half-elven]], married to [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]]. She was the daughter of [[Elrond]] and [[Celebrían]].<ref name="Tale" />

She was considered to be the fairest of the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] in the [[Third Age]], resembling [[Lúthien]] of the [[First Age]] who would never again appear in [[Ëa]]. Her romance with [[Aragorn]] was reminiscent of that between the Man [[Beren]] and the Elf Lúthien.  Like Lúthien, she rejected her [[Elves|Elven]] immortality to marry Aragorn and die with him.<ref name="Tale" />

==History==
[[File:Anna Lee - Evenstar.jpg|thumb|left|''Evenstar'' by [[Anna Lee]]]]

Arwen was born in {{TA|241}} and was the younger sister of [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]].<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> From her mother she inherited the [[Elfstone]].<ref name="CG">{{UT|6}}</ref> As one of the half-elven, she shared the right of her father to choose her fate. She lived most of her life in [[Imladris]], or in [[Lothlórien]] with her grandparents.<ref name="Tale" />

Her father fostered the sons of the [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain]], who were the exiled [[Heir of Isildur|Heirs of Isildur]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref> It was in {{TA|2952}} when she returned from Lothlórien to Rivendell when she met a young foster-son of her father, [[Aragorn]]. The young [[Dúnadan]] fell in love when he first saw her, though as he was still a youth, Arwen did not return his love.<ref name="Tale" /><ref name="TA" />

Elrond insisted that Arwen could not marry Aragorn until he became king of both [[Gondor]] and [[Arnor]]. Whether Arwen chose to marry him and become mortal, or remain with her kin as one of the Elves, she would be parted from either Elrond or Aragorn forever.<ref name="Tale" /> 
[[File:Abe Papakhian - Lord of Rivendell.jpg|left|thumb|Arwen in Rivendell, art by [[:Category:Images by Abe Papakhian|Abe Papakhian]]]]
It was not until they met many years later in Lórien that Arwen returned Aragorn's love, and in {{TA|2980}} they plighted their troth on [[Cerin Amroth]]. Aragorn gave her the [[Ring of Barahir]].<ref name="Tale" /><ref name="TA" />

In the years leading up to the [[War of the Ring]], the [[Misty Mountains]] and all lands eastward became dangerous, and at the request of her father, Arwen returned to Imladris in {{TA|3009}}.<ref name="TA" />
[[File:Janka Latečková - King and his Queen.jpg|thumb|right|''King and his Queen'' by Janka Latečková]]
Arwen was later reunited with Aragorn when he brought the [[Hobbits]] to [[Rivendell]] during the [[War of the Ring]]. She was present at a feast attended by [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]. Later that night, she and Aragorn spoke together.<ref name="Many" /> When the Fellowship departed and [[Galadriel]] offered them [[Gifts of Galadriel|her gifts]], Arwen's Elfstone, given from Galadriel to Celebrían, and Celebrían to Arwen, was the gift for Aragorn. He would wear the Elfstone ever after.<ref name="Farewell">{{FR|Farewell}}</ref> This giving held the function of a wedding gift from the family of the bride to the groom, foretelling his marriage to Arwen.<ref>{{MR|P3II3}}</ref>

Arwen wove the [[standard of Elendil]] for Aragorn from black cloth, decorating it with [[mithril]], gems and gold. She sent the banner with her brothers and a group of [[Rangers of the North]] to Aragorn before he took the [[Paths of the Dead]], thereby inspiring him to take the difficult path.<ref>{{RK|V2}}</ref> The banner was unfurled at the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] to triumphantly announce the King's return.<ref>{{RK|V6}}</ref>
[[File:The Brothers Hildebrandt - The Wedding of the King.jpg|thumb|"The Wedding of [[Aragorn|the King]]" by [[The Brothers Hildebrandt]]]]
After the defeat of [[Sauron]], Aragorn was crowned as [[King of the West]] and the new [[Reunited Kingdom]]; [[1 May|on that day]] Arwen and her father departed for [[Minas Tirith]]. On [[20 May]] they reached Lothlórien where they stayed for [[27 May|a week]] before Arwen resumed with her escort. On [[14 June]] she met her brothers and together they went to [[Edoras]] where they stayed [[16 June|two days]] before continuing to Gondor.<ref name="Chief">{{App|Chief}}</ref> 
===Queen===
Arwen arrived to [[Minas Tirith]] on [[1 Lithe]] and wed Aragorn on [[Mid-year's Day]],<ref name="Chief" /> being the third [[Unions of Elves and Men|union of Elves and Men]]. Arwen chose a fate different from her father's and did not sail to the [[Aman|West]]. Instead, she gifted Frodo, as the [[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]], passage in her stead, as she foresaw that his burden would not be lifted. She also gifted him a necklace with a white gem.<ref>{{RK|Partings}}</ref>

As Queen of Gondor, Arwen maintained a close connection with Gondor's allies, as did her husband. In {{FoA|15}} they visited the [[Hobbits]] outside [[the Shire]] and she took as a maid of honour [[Elanor Gardner]], daughter of [[Samwise Gamgee]].<ref>{{App|Later}}</ref> She was mother of one son, [[Eldarion]], and at least two unnamed daughters. After Aragorn's death, Arwen departed from Minas Tirith and returned to the abandoned Lothlórien. There she stayed for a time until she gave up her life in {{FoA|121}} at [[Cerin Amroth]], and was buried there.<ref name="Tale" />

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Arwen Undomiel.mp3|Ardamir}}
'''''Arwen''''' means "Noble Maiden" in [[Sindarin]], from ''[[ara]]-'' ("noble") and ''[[gwenn]]'' ("maiden").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 205</ref> Tolkien remarked that it also means "greatly blessed" in [[Welsh]].<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], "[[Letter to Mr Joukes|Letter to S.E.O. Joukes, 28 August 1967]]"</ref>

The [[Quenya]] form of her name is not entirely certain, but in his Quenya greeting, Aragorn refers to her again as "Arwen" (''Arwen vanimelda, namárië!'').<ref name="Farewell" /> This suggests that the form ''Arwen'' itself is also coincidentally a valid, or at least understandable, Quenya calque (using ''[[ar]]-'', stem ''Arwend-'').  

==Other names==
Her [[epessë]], '''''[[Undómiel]]''''', means "Evenstar", from ''[[Undómë]]'' ("evening twilight") and ''[[elen|el]]'' ("star").

She is also given the names ''Elrenniel'' and ''Elerondiel'', both meaning "Daughter of Elrond" in Sindarin and Quenya respectively.<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 56</ref>

==Genealogy==
Arwen was a very distant cousin of Aragorn. By their marriage, the long-sundered lines of the [[Half-elven]] were joined.<ref name="Numenor">{{App|A1i}}</ref> Their union also served to unite and preserve the bloodlines of the kings of the three kindreds of the High Elves as well as the only line with [[Maia]] blood through Arwen's great-great grandmother, [[Melian]].

==Other versions of the legendarium==
While writing the drafts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' the character was named ''[[Finduilas]]''; only during the final proofreading in [[1949]] Tolkien changed the name to ''Arwen''.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. xxviii</ref>

Tolkien considered to postpone the birth of Arwen from {{TA|241}} to {{TA|341}} , or even in {{TA|421}},<ref>{{NM|P1ix}}, p. 67.</ref> to increase the interval between the birth of the twins and the birth of Arwen where the parents were at rest, and he assigned the error in dates to a "probable scribal origin" (with the inversion of numbers 241/421).

'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:Arwen does not appear in this film.

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:Arwen is voiced by [[Sonia Fraser]].

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:Arwen appears in Rivendell after the [[Council of Elrond]]. She has a brief dialogue with Aragorn, and recites several lines from the [[Riddle of Strider]]. No voice actress is specified, but it is likely [[Kath Soucie]].

'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''
:Arwen is played by [[Liv Tyler]]. Various additional scenes pertaining to Arwen are inserted, some of which deviate from the books and some of which seem to be inspired by ''[[The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen]]''.

:In the first film, she rescues [[Frodo Baggins]] from the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] at [[Bruinen]], thwarting them with a sudden flood, summoned by an incantation. In the book, it was [[Glorfindel]] who put Frodo on horseback and sent him alone to flee the Black Riders, and Elrond and [[Gandalf]] arranged the flood. Also, in the book, Frodo defends himself against the Black Riders, whereas in the movie Arwen defends him.  Arwen wields the sword [[Hadhafang]],a non-canonical sword that belonged to her father.

:There is a scene in which Aragorn has a dream about Arwen in which they kiss, a scene where Arwen has an argument with her father about leaving for [[Valinor]], and a scene where she actually departs for Valinor and then changes her mind and returns when she sees a vision of her future son, Eldarion.

:In addition, towards the end of the cinematic trilogy she apparently becomes sick, seemingly as a result of her forsaking her immortality. Elrond takes the reforged [[Narsil]], now [[Andúril]], to Aragorn at Dunharrow, and tells him that her fate has become bound with [[the One Ring]], and that she is dying. However, no explanation is ever given for these statements. It is possible that Elrond's comments of her dying is simply a metaphor of her becoming mortal, and that he is not implying she has a connection with the Ring, but that Arwen's decision to stay means that her future, like the other free peoples of Middle-earth, now rests on the destruction of the ring. Later, after the Ring is destroyed, Arwen is present at Aragorn's coronation without any signs of illness.

'''2003: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of Arwen is provided by Slávka Halčáková. She only appears in person in the third series (season) of the adaptation, during the events of ''The Return of the King'', but is alluded to earlier.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Arwen can be found in a gazebo overlooking the path from [[Rivendell]] into the Misty Mountains. Her roles in the game was initially small, and her only significant interaction with the player was the passing of Elessar's banner that she made for [[Aragorn]] and bid the player to deliver to [[Halbarad]]. After the downfall of [[Sauron]], her prominence increases as [[Elrond]] and his household travel to [[Minas Tirith]] for her wedding. On their way towards [[Lothlórien]] from the lands of the [[Beornings]], Arwen asks her father to visit the cave in which her mother [[Celebrian]] was tormented by [[orcs]] before being rescued. She later discusses that experience with Lady [[Galadriel]].

'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''
:Arwen resides in Rivendell, where players can discuss with her both historical and present subjects. While sporting the appearance of [[Liv Tyler]], her role is closer to the book than that in the movie: for example, she provides Halbarad and the Grey Company with the banner she had made for Aragorn, an event omitted from the movie adaptation. She is voiced by [[Courtenay Taylor]].
