'''Malbeth''' was a [[seer]] and royal counsellor gifted with [[foresight]] who is remembered in lore for two prophecies concerning the fate of the descendants of [[Isildur]]. 

==History==
Malbeth was probably a [[Dúnedain of the North|Dúnadan of the North]] who appears to have been a royal counsellor to the [[King of Arthedain]].<ref name=guide>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Malbeth"</ref> He flourished during the reigns of [[Araphant]] and [[Arvedui]].<ref group=note>Malbeth's Númenorean ancestry is also evidenced in the length of time between the dates of the seer's known prophecies (1864 and 1975); at the time of the second prophecy, Malbeth must have been well over 100 years old.</ref> 

===Last King of Arthedain===
In {{TA|1864}} when the son of [[Araphant]] (fourteenth [[Kings of Arnor|King]] of [[Arthedain]]) was born, Malbeth advised Araphant to name his son ''[[Arvedui]]'', meaning "''last king''":
{{blockquote|Arvedui you shall call him, for he will be the last in Arthedain. Though a choice will come to the Dúnedain, and if they take the one that seems less hopeful, then your son will change his name and become king of a great realm. If not, then much sorrow and many lives of men shall pass, until the Dúnedain arise and are united again.|''[[Appendix A]], Annals of the Kings and Rulers'': (iv) Gondor and the Heirs of Anárion}}

===Paths of the Dead===
Malbeth's second prophecy was made in the days of Arvedui (ruled {{TA|1964}} - {{TA|1974|n}}), in which the seer foretold [[Aragorn]]'s passage through the [[Paths of the Dead]] even though the event was over a thousand years in the future:
{{blockquote|Over the land there lies a long shadow,<br>westward reaching wings of darkness.<br>The Tower trembles; to the tombs of kings<br>doom approaches. The Dead awaken;<br>for the hour is come for the oathbreakers:<br>at the [[Stone of Erech]] they shall stand again<br>and hear there a horn in the hills ringing.<br>Whose shall the horn be? Who shall call them<br>from the grey twilight, the forgotten people?<br>The heir of him to whom the oath they swore.<br>From the North shall he come, need shall drive him:<br>he shall pass the Door to the Paths of the Dead.|''[[The Return of the King]]'', "[[The Passing of the Grey Company]]", "[[Over the land there lies a long shadow]]"}}

==Legacy==
Indeed, when [[Gondor]] was left without a [[Kings of Gondor|King]], Arvedui claimed the kingship, both as a [[Heir of Isildur]] and as the husband of Gondorian princess [[Fíriel]] who would be entitled to succeed her father to the throne. However the [[Gondorians]] ruled out his claim ("the one that seems less hopeful") choosing instead [[Earnil II|someone]] from the [[House of Anárion]], so Arvedui never became "king of a great realm" and didn't change his name. Instead as Malbeth said, there was "much sorrow"; the [[Battle of Fornost]] destroyed the North-kingdom, and Arvedui was drowned in the sea soon after, the last king of Arthedain.<ref>{{App|A}}</ref>

Malbeth's second prophecy was also fulfilled centuries later, during the [[War of the Ring]] when Aragorn (sixteenth [[Chieftain of the Dúnedain]]) learned from the ''[[palantíri|palantír]]'' that [[Gondor]] was being threatened from the south by a fleet of [[Corsairs]] from [[Umbar]]. He needed a route to get to them in haste, and [[Elrond]]'s message ("''Bid Aragorn remember the words of the seer, and the [[Paths of the Dead]]''") told him how. Aragorn (with [[Legolas]], [[Gimli]] and the [[Grey Company]]) travelled through the Paths of the Dead to the Stone of Erech where Aragorn blew a horn to summon the [[Oathbreakers]]. He told them he was [[Isildur]]'s heir and so they fulfilled their oath and defeated the Corsairs which helped Gondor win the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].<ref name=company>{{RK|Company}}</ref>

Aragorn fulfilled again the first prophecy, where Arvedui had failed; after "much sorrow and many lives of men", Aragorn finally became [[High King of the Dúnedain]] who were "[[Reunited Kingdom|united again]]".

==Etymology==
''Malbeth'' is [[Sindarin]] for "Golden Word", from ''[[malt]]'' ("gold") + [[Lenition|lenited]] ''[[peth]]'' ("word, voice").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3294592247.html|articlename=S. ''Malbeth'' m.|website=Eldamo}}</ref>
