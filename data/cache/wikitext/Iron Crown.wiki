The '''Iron Crown''' was the crown forged by [[Morgoth]] to hold the three [[Silmarils]].

==History==
===First Age===
The Iron Crown was forged by [[Morgoth]] in the year {{YT|1495}} on his return to [[Middle-earth]] to hold the three [[Silmarils]]. He bore it throughout the [[First Age]], and would not remove it, although it was a great burden to him.<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref> In {{FA|466}}, [[Lúthien]] cast a spell of sleep upon Morgoth, and as he fell to the ground, the Iron Crown rolled away. [[Beren]] retrieved a Silmaril from it using the knife [[Angrist]]. He attempted to take a second, but the knife broke, and Morgoth stirred.<ref>{{S|Beren}}</ref> After Morgoth's defeat by the [[Valar]] in the [[War of Wrath]], the crown was beaten into a collar for his neck.<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref>

===Third Age===
Ages later, [[Samwise Gamgee]] mentioned the "Iron Crown in [[Thangorodrim]]" to [[Frodo Baggins]] while mentioning [[Beren]]'s renowned [[Quest for the Silmaril]].<ref>{{TT|IV8}}, p. 712</ref>
