==Summary==
A hydrofoil of "Aquastroll" had been named ''[[Shadowfax]]''. Tolkien told Rayner that he wished copyright could protect names: devising good names had cost him as much time, or even more, than writing lines of poetry. It had been brought to his attention by several writers that a "monstrous" hydrofoil was named ''Shadowfax'', without even a "by your leave", and Tolkien was not happy about it.<ref group="note">The name ''Shadowfax'' is now under the scope of the [[Middle-earth Enterprises/Copyrights|licensing powers]] of [[Middle-earth Enterprises]].</ref> He was getting used to all the ''[[Rivendell]]s'', ''[[Lothlórien|Lóriens]]'' and ''[[Rivendell#Etymology|Imladris]]'' used on houses, though not all were accompanied by a letter containing the words "by your leave".
