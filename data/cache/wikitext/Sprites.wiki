'''Sprites''', or '''fays''', were creatures only mentioned fleetingly in the earliest versions of the tales of [[Arda]] and linguistic writings of the [[Eldar]].<ref name=LT1-66>{{LT1|III}}, p. 66</ref><ref name=PE11>{{PE|11}}</ref>

== Characteristics ==
The sprites and fays were part of what apparently was a three-fold division of the lesser [[Ainur|Ainu]] spirits: [[sylphs]] (spirits of the air), sprites (spirits of the earth), and [[mermaids|water spirits]]:<ref name=LT1-66/>

{{blockquote|About them fared a great host who are the sprites of trees and woods, of dale and forest and mountain-side, or those that sing amid the grass at morning and chant among the standing corn at eve.<br />
<br />
...their number is very great: yet must they not be confused with the Eldar, for they were born before the world and are older than its oldest, and are not of it, but laugh at it much, for had they not somewhat to do with its making, so that it is for the most part a play for them.}}

The poem ''[[An Evening in Tavrobel]]'' mentions tiny, gleaming [[spirits]] that appear dancing<ref>{{ATB|A2}}, pp. 284-5></ref> alluding to sprites or fays.

== Names and divisions ==
While "sprites" and "fays" seem to have been the most common names for these creatures, other names were also used: '''[[Wikipedia:Brownie (folklore)|brownies]]''', '''[[Wikipedia:Pixie|pixies]]''', and '''[[leprawns]]'''.<ref name=LT1-66/> 

A basic division of four groups of sprites and fays, with their [[Elvish]] names, are given as follow:

#'''''[[Nermir]]''''': "fays of the meads";<ref name=LT1-66/><ref name=LT1Index/> [[Gnomish]] ''nermil'': "a fay that haunts meadows and riverbanks"<ref name=PE11/>
#'''''[[Tavari]]''''': "sprites of trees and woods",<ref name=LT1-66/> or "fays of the woods";<ref name=LT1Index/> [[Gnomish]] ''tavor'': "a wood fay"<ref name=PE11/> ([[Qenya]] ''tavar'', ''tavarni'' "dale-sprites", [[Sundocarme|root]] [[TAW|TAVA]];<ref name="Lexicon">{{PE|12}}</ref><ref name=LT1App>{{LT1|Appendix}}</ref> the plural noun ''tavárin'', nominative of ''tavārin'' "fay(s) of the woods"<ref name=PE16>{{PE|16}}, p. 80</ref><ref>{{PE|14}}, p. 10</ref>)
#'''''[[Nandini]]''''': "fays of the valleys";<ref name=LT1-66/><ref name=LT1Index/> [[Gnomish]] ''nandir'': fay of the country" ([[Qenya]] ''nandin'')<ref name=PE11/>
#'''''[[Orossi]]''''': "fays of the mountains"<ref name=LT1-66/><ref name=LT1Index>{{LT1|Index}}</ref>

In a poem appear the ''[[oromandi]]'', "wood-spirits".<ref>{{MC|Secret}}, pp. 215-6</ref>

Some other mentions of fays seem rather to be referring to individuals:

*'''[[Ailinónë]]''', a fairy who dwelt in a lily on a pool<ref name="Lexicon"/>
*'''[[Nardi]]''', a flower-fairy<ref name="Lexicon"/>
*'''[[Sacha]]''', a fire-fay<ref name=PE11/>
*'''[[Tavros (wood-fay)|Tavros]]''', "chief wood-fay, ''the Blue Spirit of the Woods''"<ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 69</ref>
*'''[[Tethil]]''', a fay who dwelt in a [[poppies|poppy]]<ref name=PE11/>
*'''[[Tevildo]]''', an "evil fay in [[Cats|beastlike]] shape"<ref>{{LT2|I}}, p. 29</ref>
*'''[[Tinfang]]''', the flutist (surnamed ''Gwarbilin'', Birdward); a fay<ref name=PE11/>
*'''[[Tû (king of the Hisildi)|Tû]]''', a fay, and the king of the [[Hisildi]]<ref>{{LT1|X}}, p. 232</ref>
*'''[[Uolë]]''', a [[Moon]]-fay<ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 74</ref>
*'''[[Velindo]]''', a fay of [[Aulë]]'s folk<ref>{{PE|15}}, p. 96</ref>
*'''[[Wendelin]]''', a fay,<ref>{{LT1|V}}, p. 120</ref> and the Queen of the [[Ilkorindi|Woodland Elves]]<ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, entry '''Wendelin''', p. 273</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
Sprites and fays are not mentioned in the later versions of the [[legendarium]]. Many of the classes of beings referred to in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'' were superseded by the concept of the [[Maiar]], which were not introduced until the reworking of the ''[[Annals of Valinor]]'' into the ''[[Annals of Aman]]''.<ref name="MRP2b">{{MR|P2b}}</ref>

Tolkien had said that as a child (and his children in turn) he always disliked "flower-[[fairies]] and fluttering sprites with antennae", a tradition that he traced back to [[Wikipedia:Michael Drayton|Michael Drayton]]'s ''Nimphidia, the Court of Faery'', which he considered "one of the worst ever written".<ref>{{HM|OFS}}</ref> In his youth he had written the poem ''[[Goblin Feet]]'' for [[Oxford Poetry 1915|''Oxford Poetry'' 1915]], mentioning "fairy lanterns", gnomes and leprechauns; at some later point Tolkien mentioned that soon after (c. [[1915]]) he "started to fervently dislike" such whimsical elements and denounced his poem as an "unhappy little thing".<ref name="LT1">{{LT1|I}}, p. 32</ref>

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
'''1995-8: ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]'':'''
:The Warrior Ally card "Lindion the Oronín", portraying a unique character, is given the following description: "''The fays of the mountains pipe melodies that harmonize with wind and weather, pleasing to the ears of all creatures aloft on wings''", apparently inspired by the Orossi (see above). Lindion is playable at the site Stone-circle in the region Old Pûkel Gap.
