'''Tarcil''' ({{TA|280}}<ref name=PM/> – {{TA|515|n}},<ref name=App/> aged 235 years) was the sixth [[King of Arnor]].

==History==
Tarcil succeeded his father, [[Arantar]], when he died in [[Third Age 435]]. Tarcil was great-great-grandson of [[Isildur]].

Tarcil ruled uneventfully for eighty years, and was succeeded by his son, [[Tarondor (King of Arnor)|Tarondor]], upon his death in [[Third Age 515]].<ref name=App/>

== Etymology ==
''Tarcil'' is a [[Quenya]] name. Its meaning is not glossed, but the spelling variant [[Tarkil]] also appears in early drafts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as the name of the sixth king of Arnor.<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, manuscript C with corrections and expansions, The Northern Line of Arnor: the Isildurioni, 6. Tarkil, p. 192.</ref> 

Based on its etymology, it means "[[High Man]]" or "Númenorean" and is a compound of ''[[tar|tar-]]'' ("high") and a shortened from of ''[[Hildo]]'' ("Man").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-788910631.html|articlename=Q. ''Tarcil'' m.|website=Eldamo|accessed=27 January 2022}}</ref> See ''[[tarkil]]'' for more.

In early drafts "the Tarkil" was a nickname for [[Aragorn]] before replaced by "the Dúnadan".<ref>{{TI|Gandalf}}, p. 8</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 603</ref>
