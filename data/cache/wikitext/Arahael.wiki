'''Arahael''' ({{TA|2012}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 196</ref> - {{TA|2177|n}},<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 165) was the second [[Chieftain of the Dúnedain]], succeeding his father, [[Aranarth]], when he died in 2106.

==History==
Arahael was raised by [[Elrond]] in [[Rivendell]] (as were all his descendants) while his father protected [[Eriador]] from the evils of the wild with the help of other [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]].

Arahael's reign was uneventful (as far as we know), due to the secretive (and therefore now little-known) nature of the [[Dúnedain]], and the [[Watchful Peace]] which there was at that time. It is likely that the Rangers fought minor battles and skirmishes against [[orcs]] in order to keep the region safe.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref>

Arahael died in 2177, having been Chieftain for 65 years, and was followed by his son, [[Aranuir]].<ref name="North"/>

==Etymology==
''Arahael'' is a [[Sindarin]] name. Its meaning is not glossed, but the Association Tolkiendil suggests it means "Wise King".<ref name=Tolkiendil>{{webcite|author=Association Tolkiendil|articleurl=https://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/compound_sindarin_names|articlename=Compound Sindarin Names in Middle-earth|website=Tolkiendil|accessed=05 February 2022}}</ref> It is probably a compound of the prefix ''[[ar|ar(a)-]]'' ("noble", "royal", "high"), a phonetic reduction of ''[[aran]]'' ("king"), and the [[lenition|lenited]] from ''hael'' of ''sael'' ("wise").<ref name=Tolkiendil/><ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-2881029861.html|articlename=S.
