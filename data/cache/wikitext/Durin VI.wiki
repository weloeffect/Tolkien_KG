'''Durin VI''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|1731|n}} – {{TA|1980|n}}, lived 249 years) was a King of Durin's folk and ruled at their capital, the great [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] city of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]].

==History==
Like all Durins after [[Durin|Durin I]] he was given the name of the first [[Fathers of the Dwarves|Father of the Dwarves]] because he greatly resembled him in both appearance and manner. Indeed it was believed among the Dwarves that he was the reincarnation of Durin I, though whether this is possible is unclear.<ref name="Durin"/>

Near the end of Durin VI's reign, the Dwarves, mining for ''[[mithril]]'',  encountered a [[Balrogs|Balrog]] that had hidden itself deep beneath the city. The monster began to wreak havoc on Khazad-dûm and slew Durin. Since the surviving Dwarves were unsure what type of monster they faced, the Balrog was simply called "[[Durin's Bane]]". Durin's son [[Náin I]] was slain shortly thereafter, leaving his grandson [[Thráin I]] to lead Durin's folk as the survivors fled from their ancestral home.<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref>

==Etymology==
One account states that the name ''Durin ''was a word for "king" in the language of the [[Men of the North]] in the early [[Second Age]].<ref name=relations>{{PM|Relations}}</ref> 

Another account states that ''Durinn'' is one of the Dwarfs in the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. The name means "Sleepy".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>
