'''Tom Pickthorn''' was a [[Men of Bree|man of Bree]].  He was killed in early January, {{TA|3019}}, fighting [[Bill Ferny]] and [[Sharkey]]'s [[ruffians]].  [[Barliman Butterbur]] referred to him as "Little Tom Pickthorn" so he must have been shorter than [[Mat Heathertoes]] and [[Rowlie Appledore]], two other men of Bree who were killed.<ref>{{RK|Homeward}}</ref>
