==Lyrics==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Leave the halls and caverns deep 
Were the forests wide and dim 
Stoops in shadow grey and grim 

Float beyond the world of trees 
Past the rushes, past the reeds 
Past the marshes, weaving weeds 

"[...] and the crowns of seven kings, and the rods of the Five Wizards." 

South away! South away now! 
Far away seek the sunlight and the day. 

Hail, Éomer, king of the mark.
