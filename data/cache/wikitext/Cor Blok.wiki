'''Cornelius "Cor" Blok''' ([[1934]]-[[2021]]<ref name = "Obituary"></ref>) was a Dutch professor of art history. In the 1960s, he created more than one hundred pieces of art influenced by the legendarium of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].

J.R.R. Tolkien himself was fond of Blok's minimalistic illustrations, and bought two ("The Battle of Hornburg" and "The Dead Marshes") and was given another ("Dunhov").

Blok's illustrations have been featured as cover art for a Dutch edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' (Spectrum paperback edition in three volumes, published in [[1965]]), in ''[[Realms of Tolkien]]'', the  [[Tolkien Calendar 1998]], and the [[Official Tolkien Calendar 2011]].

In the summer of [[2005]], there was a Cor Blok exhibition at the Lustrum celebrations of [[Unquendor]] (the Dutch Tolkien Society), where Blok was guest of honor.

Cor Blok's paper "Pictures to accompany a Great Story" was published in ''[[Lembas Extra: Proceedings of the 5th Unquendor Lustrum]]'' in [[2008]].

In [[2011]], [[HarperCollins]] published a collection of Blok's pictures inspired by ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', entitled ''[[A Tolkien Tapestry]]'' (edited by [[Pieter Collier]]).<ref>[http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/press/991-A_Tolkien_Tapestry.php A Tolkien Tapestry] at [http://www.tolkienlibrary.com/index.php TolkienLibrary.com] (accessed 29 September 2011)</ref>
