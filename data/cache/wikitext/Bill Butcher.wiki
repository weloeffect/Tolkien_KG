'''Bill Butcher''' was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] inhabitant of the town of [[Delving]] who appeared in ''[[Perry-the-Winkle]]'', a nursery rhyme<ref name=collectedpoems>{{CP|105}}</ref> by [[Samwise Gamgee]]<ref name=preface>{{AB|Preface}}</ref>.<ref name="Perry">{{AB|Perry}}, pp. 41-4</ref>

In the poem, Bill Butcher was accompanied by his dog [[Grip (Bill Butcher's dog)|Grip]] when he threw a knife upon seeing the [[Lonely Troll]] peeping over the stalls of the market-place.<ref name="Perry" />

It is possible that Bill Butcher may have been one of the [[Shire-hobbits]] who travelled to [[Faraway]] in order to demand food from the Lonely Troll.<ref name="Perry" />

==Background==
In the first version of the poem in early [[1928]],<ref name=commentary>{{AB|Comm}}, ''Perry-the-Winkle''</ref> which was entitled ''The Bumpus'', the butcher was unnamed, "threw his knives", and had no dog.<ref name=collectedpoems>{{CP|105}}</ref> No changes to the character occurred in the second version on [[29 March]],<ref name=collectedpoems/> in which Tolkien revised the poem as part<ref name=collectedpoems/> of his ''[[Tales and Songs of Bimble Bay]]'' series. The third version also retained the same details in relation to the butcher.<ref name=commentary/>

In early [[1961]],<ref name=collectedpoems/> when Tolkien revised the poem for inclusion within ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'', the unnamed butcher was accompanied by his dog (instead of "Harry and his father"), threw a single knife, and was given the name '''Bill butcher'''. In a later revision, Tolkien capitalized the word butcher in Bill's name<ref name="Perry" />.<ref name=collectedpoems/>
