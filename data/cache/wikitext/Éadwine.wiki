'''Éadwine''' was a [[Man]] living in the [[Wikipedia:Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon England]] in the [[Wikipedia:9th century|9th century AD]]. He was the father of the famous seafarer [[Ælfwine]], the first mortal to find the [[Straight Road]] in thousands of years.<ref name="Ead"/>

== History ==
Éadwine was an experienced seaman, who often told stories of strange, faraway lands to his young son Ælfwine. However, around the year [[Seventh Age 878|878 AD]], when Ælfwine was still a child, Éadwine took his ship [[Éarendel]] out to the sea and never returned. Around the same time, Éadwine's wife fled to her kin in [[Wikipedia:Cornwall|West Wales]], taking their son with her.<ref name="Ead">{{SD|69}}, p. 270</ref>

== Etymology ==
