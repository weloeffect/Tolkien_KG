The '''Men of Dale''',<ref name="Meetings">{{FR|Meetings}}, p. 229</ref><ref>{{App|Writing}}, p. 1117</ref>, '''Dale-men'''<ref>{{FR|Farewell}}, p. 369</ref> or '''Bardings'''<ref name="Meetings"/><ref>{{TT|Riders}}, p. 431</ref> were Men who dwelt in [[Dale]].

==History==
There was a folk of [[Northmen]] by the Mountain [[Erebor]] already by {{TA|1856}}. That year, that folk was joined by other Northmen who fled from the wide plains between [[Mirkwood]] and the [[River Running]] after the disastrous defeat of the [[Battle of the Plains]].<ref>{{UT|Northmen}}</ref>

More [[Northmen]] gradually came up the River Running from the south after King [[Thrór]] reestablished the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] in Erebor<ref name="Party">{{H|Party}}</ref> in {{TA|2590}}<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2590, p. 1087</ref>.

There those Northmen built the town of Dale.<ref name="Party"/> The town shared in the prosperity of the [[Dwarves]] and it was governed by the [[Lord of Dale]].<ref>{{H|Fire}}</ref>

In {{TA|2770|n}}, during the time of [[Girion]], [[Smaug]] descended upon the Dwarf-kingdom.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2770, p. 1088</ref> The Men fielded warriors against him but could not prevent the [[Sack of Erebor]]. After that, the dragon would crawl out of the [[Front Gate]] of the Mountain by night and carry away people (especially maidens) to eat. The remaining population soon fled and the deserted city fell into ruins.<ref name="Party"/>

Many went to dwell on the [[Long Lake]] with the [[Lake-men]], including the last descendant of Girion, [[Bard]]. After the town of Dale was rebuilt by Bard and Bard became the [[King of Dale]] in {{TA|2944}},<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2944, p. 1089</ref> its people were known as [[Bardings]]<ref name="Meetings"/>.

==Culture==
The Men of Dale flourished with trade with the [[Dwarves of Erebor]].

They spoke [[Westron]] and their own [[language of Dale|language]].
