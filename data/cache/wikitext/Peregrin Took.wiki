<center>{{quote|There must be someone with intelligence in [[Fellowship of the Ring|the party]]."<br>"Then you certainly will not be chosen, Peregrin Took!|Pippin and [[Gandalf]], ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', "[[The Ring Goes South]]"}}</center>

'''Peregrin ''"Pippin"'' Took''' was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]], the son of [[Paladin Took II|Paladin Took]]. He was the youngest of the four Hobbits in the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], being in his tweens, but grew up quickly and eventually became a Knight of Gondor. [[Elrond]], at least, seemed to doubt his capability for the quest, but Pippin proved to be a loyal and courageous friend.

After the [[War of the Ring]], Peregrin eventually inherited the [[Thain]]ship in [[the Shire]] after his father's death.

==Ancestry==
He was born in the [[Third Age]] [[Third Age 2990|2990]] (1390 in [[Shire Reckoning]]) to [[Paladin Took II|Paladin Took]] and [[Eglantine Banks]], making him a great-great-grandson of the [[Gerontius Took|Old Took]]. Pippin became Thain in later years, and his father inherited the title in S.R. 1415 from [[Ferumbras Took III]] when he died without an heir. Pippin had three older sisters, [[Pearl Took]], [[Pimpernel Took]], and [[Pervinca Took]].<ref name="Took">{{App|Took}}</ref>

Through his father, Pippin was a first cousin of [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] (the future [[Master of Buckland]]), the second cousin once removed of [[Frodo Baggins]], and the first cousin twice removed of [[Bilbo Baggins]]. He was not blood-related to [[Samwise Gamgee]], but Pippin's son [[Faramir Took I|Faramir]] married Sam's daughter [[Goldilocks Gardner]] in 1463.

==History==
When he was young he was a guest at [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]] with his family. As his uncle the [[Thain]] [[Ferumbras Took III|Ferumbras]] was childless, Pippin's father, Paladin, became the Thain.<ref name="Took" /> Pippin's closest friends were his cousins, [[Merry Brandybuck]] and Frodo<ref name="shadow">{{FR|Shadow}}</ref> (all descendants of the Old Took). Pippin and Merry often wandered at the [[Marish]] and used to visit [[Farmer Maggot]]; he knew the lands around the Marish and enjoyed the beer of the ''[[Golden Perch]]'' at [[Stock]].<ref name="short">{{FR|I4}}</ref>

He was one of the [[Conspirators]], who knew the truth behind Frodo's mysterious behaviour and reasons for departure of the Shire. Along with Merry, [[Fredegar Bolger]] and [[Folco Boffin]] they helped Frodo pack his household and send carts to [[Crickhollow]]; they celebrated together his last [[22 September|birthday]] in [[Bag End]], and stayed with Frodo and [[Samwise Gamgee]] when the others left for [[Buckland]].

===Travels with Frodo===
[[File:Anke Eißmann - Three is Company.jpg|thumb|left|''Three is Company'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]
The [[23 September|next day]] he accompanied Frodo and Sam to [[Bucklebury]]. During the first days of the travel, Pippin was he who complained first for being tired, sleepy or hungry. The [[24 September|next day]] they encountered [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] who were turned away by a [[Wandering Companies|company]] of [[High Elves]] led by [[Gildor]], and Pippin greeted them expressing his respect. During their camp he felt he was in a dream, enchanted by the [[Light of Valinor|light]] of their faces and their beautiful voices. Once he fell asleep, the Elves moved and laid him to a soft bed at a bower under the trees.<ref>{{FR|Three}}</ref>

The [[25 September|other morning]] he woke up first and wanted to finish off the elven bread if not for Sam's insistence to leave some for him and Frodo. When Frodo woke up they had an argument as Frodo wanted to cut through Marish to avoid any Black Riders, and Pippin regretted for not stopping at Stock.<ref name="short" />

In Buckland, they joined Merry and Fatty. It was there that Frodo learned about his friends' "conspiracy" and that they did not intend to let him leave [[The Shire]] without them. They left the Shire to meet [[Gandalf]] in [[Bree]]. Pippin's enthusiasm to accompany Frodo is the result of his adventurous 'Tookish' nature as well as his loyalty and friendship to his cousin.

The stuffiness and eeriness of [[The Old Forest]] made Pippin the most uncomfortable of the four [[Hobbits]] with him becoming more and more suspicious of the intentions of the Forest; Pippin was, however, right to be suspicious as he was trapped by [[Old Man Willow]] before being rescued by [[Tom Bombadil]]. On the way to [[Bree]], from Tom Bombadil's house, Pippin again fell into misfortune as he was trapped by a [[Barrow-wights|Barrow-wight]] on the [[Barrow-downs]]. 
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Under the Spell of the Barrow-wight.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Under the Spell of the Barrow-wight'']]
Whilst at [[The Prancing Pony]] Pippin began to recklessly tell the story of [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]'s birthday and subsequent disappearance. In order to prevent information about the Ring being revealed, Frodo started to sing - during the song Frodo fell from the table and the Ring slipped upon his finger. As a result, The Prancing Pony was attacked by the [[Nazgûl]] during the night, but the four Hobbits were unharmed thanks to the mysterious [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]], [[Aragorn|Strider]].

===Fellowship of the Ring===
When Pippin finally arrived at [[Rivendell]] he was concerned that he and Merry would be left behind whilst both Sam and Frodo get to go on the [[Quest of the Ring|Quest]]. However, his indignant attitude paid off as [[Gandalf]] believed that the friendship between Pippin and the other Hobbits would be beneficial to the Quest.

When in [[Moria]], Pippin incurred the wrath of Gandalf on two separate occasions: Pippin annoyed Gandalf with a foolish question while Gandalf was trying to open the [[Doors of Durin|West-gate of Moria]]; and, when inside the [[Well-chamber]] in Moria,<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[The Chronology of The Lord of the Rings]], p. 40</ref> Pippin's curiosity got the better of him as he dropped a stone down a well which lead to the [[Fellowship of the Ring|the Fellowship]] hearing the drums in the deep - in doing so Pippin gained the retort, "''Fool of a Took!''" from Gandalf.

===With Treebeard===
During the [[Breaking of the Fellowship]], [[Boromir]] died defending Merry and Pippin from capture by the [[Uruk-hai]] who were taking the Hobbits back to [[Saruman]] at [[Isengard]] on the mistaken belief that one of them had [[The One Ring|the Ring]]. On the journey to Isengard, Pippin displayed intelligence and resourcefulness by cutting his own bonds and leaving his [[Elven brooches|Elven brooch]] from [[Lothlórien]] on the ground for Aragorn to find.

Whilst held captive, Merry and Pippin became aware that the [[Orcs|Orc]] [[Grishnákh]] had guessed that they might have the Ring, so they used Grishnákh's greed to untie them and take them away from the other Orcs. When the [[Rohirrim]] attacked the Uruk-hai, Grishnákh was killed by a spear and Merry and Pippin were able to escape into [[Fangorn Forest]] where they encountered [[Treebeard]] and the other [[Ents]].

[[File:Ted Nasmith - Wellinghall.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Wellinghall'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
Merry and Pippin struck up a friendship with Treebeard, telling him about all that had happened on their journey, whilst Treebeard told the two hobbits about the loss of the [[Entwives]](and much more besides). Treebeard decided to call an [[Entmoot]] at [[Derndingle]] to decide the Ents' next move. While the Entmoot was going on, Pippin and Merry were left in the care of a 'hasty' Ent named [[Quickbeam]] who had already decided to go to battle with the Orcs as many of his tree friends had been killed.
[[File:Peter Pracownik - Six of Cups (LOTR).jpg|thumb|180px|[[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and Pippin relax and joke after the fall of [[Orthanc]] - Art by [[Peter Pracownik]]]]
Merry and Pippin [[Ents#The March of the Ents|marched with the Ents]] to Isengard where the Ents killed the remaining servants of Saruman, filled the [[Ring of Isengard]] with water, and kept Saruman hostage in [[Orthanc]]. Whilst sitting on their "field of victory", Merry and Pippin were reunited with Aragorn, [[Gandalf]], [[Gimli]] and [[Legolas]] with whom they shared some [[pipe-weed]] and a meal. 

Following Gandalf's confrontation with Saruman, [[Gríma]] threw the [[Orthanc-stone|palantír of Isengard]] out of the window at Gandalf which Pippin subsequently picked up. After Gandalf took it from him, Pippin remained curious about it, and later remarked to Merry about how he would like to look at it again. Unable to sleep, Pippin was finally overcome by curiosity. He stole the palantír from Gandalf's keeping while he slept, but when he looked into it, he was seen by [[Sauron]] who mistakenly believed that Pippin and the Ring were with Saruman in Isengard. After a Nazgûl flew by on its [[Fell beasts|Fell beast]], Gandalf realised that war was coming soon, and he rode immediately for [[Minas Tirith]], taking Pippin with him for safe keeping.

===Guard of the Citadel===
[[File:Peter Xavier Price - Pippin Comforts Merry.jpeg|thumb|right|''Pippin Comforts Merry'' by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]]
Upon arriving in Minas Tirith, Pippin went with Gandalf to the [[Citadel of Gondor|Citadel]] and recounted Boromir's death to [[Denethor]], who was Boromir's father as well as the [[Ruling Steward]]. In return for Boromir's untimely death, Pippin decided to pledge his allegiance to the grieving [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward]] and so became a [[Guards of the Citadel|Guard of the Citadel]]. Pippin befriended [[Beregond]], of the [[Third Company of the Citadel]], who showed him 'round the city and told him the secret passwords and ways of the city, and became good friends with Beregond's son [[Bergil]].

[[File:Anke Eißmann - Pyre of Denethor.jpeg|thumb|left|''The Pyre of Denethor'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]
Denethor was amused with the Hobbit's manners, especially the way he spoke to him in a very informal and personalized familiar language, as with a close friend or social equal, since the [[Hobbitish|Hobbit-speech]] lacked formal forms. Denethor's servants were astonished to this view, and probably gave strength to the rumor that Pippin was of very high social rank within his own country, and soon a wild rumor circulated, that the "[[Ernil i Pheriannath]]" had promised 5,000 Hobbits to the defence of the city.

During the [[Siege of Gondor]], Pippin was instrumental in saving [[Faramir]]'s life. After Faramir had returned from battle, he was badly wounded and suffering from the [[Black Breath]]; [[Denethor]] looked into the [[Anor-stone|palantír of Minas Tirith]] and saw the full might of [[Mordor]]. Believing that Sauron's forces would prevail in battle, Denethor ordered his servants to set a pyre so both he and Faramir could burn alive, but Pippin was able to fetch Gandalf and Beregond who were both able to help save Faramir.

After the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], Pippin found [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] all in a daze - due to Merry's confrontation with the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]] - and took him to the [[Houses of Healing]] where he was healed by [[Aragorn]]. Pippin accompanied the forces of [[Rohan]] and [[Gondor]] to the [[Black Gate]] where he participated in the [[Battle of the Morannon]], and saved Beregond's life by slaying a [[Hill-trolls|hill-troll]]. Pippin was crushed beneath the troll, but he was pulled out by [[Gimli]] who recognized his foot.

===Return to the Shire===
When Pippin and the other Hobbits returned to The Shire, they were enraged to see what had happened to their peaceful corner of the world. Pippin went off to [[Tookland]] to raise up the [[Took Family|Took]]s in rebellion, and when he returned for the [[Battle of Bywater]] he brought 100 strong hobbits with him. Pippin and Merry jointly commanded the Hobbit victory and their names were placed at the top of [[The Roll]] commemorating those who fought in the battle.<ref name="Scouring">{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>
[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Return of the King - Pippin and Diamond.jpg|thumb|left|Pippin meets his future wife.]]
Pippin and Merry were heroes, and would tell all the other hobbits the stories of their travels to far-off lands. They would often go out abroad wearing their armour (Pippin had remained a Knight of Gondor) and people thought they were lordly - a position likely enforced by their extraordinary height caused by the [[Ent-draughts]] (they were at least 4'5<nowiki>''</nowiki> tall - taller than [[Bandobras Took|Bullroarer Took]]).<ref name="Concerning">{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref>

In {{SR|1427}} (at the age of 37), he married [[Diamond of Long Cleeve]], and they had a child together, [[Faramir Took I|Faramir]], [[Fourth Age 9|three years later]].<ref name="later" /> 
===Thainship===
[[File:Gregor Roffalski - Thain Peregrin I.jpg|thumb|''Thain Peregrin I'' by Gregor Roffalski]]
In {{SR|1434}} (at the age of 44) Pippin succeeded his father [[Paladin Took II|Paladin]] by becoming the 32nd [[Thain|Thain of the Shire]], and was also made a Counsellor of the North-kingdom by King Elessar.<ref name="later" />

In {{SR|1436}} King Elessar rode north and met Pippin, Merry and Sam at the [[Brandywine Bridge]]. In {{SR|1452}} the King, as a gift, added the [[Westmarch]] to The Shire, and in {{SR|1462}} at Sam's request Pippin appointed [[Fastred of Greenholm|Fastred]] - son-in-law of Sam - as the first [[Warden of Westmarch]].<ref name="later" />

As Thain, Pippin collected a library of historical information at [[Great Smials]], especially information relating to [[Númenor]] and the heirs of [[Elendil]]. It was at Great Smials that ''[[Appendix B|The Tale of Years]]'' was likely put together, with assistance from Merry, although Pippin himself probably didn't write any works. His successors expanded the collection.<ref name="Records">{{FR|Records}}</ref>

In {{SR|1484}}, at the age of 94 and having been Thain for 50 years, Pippin and Merry passed on their possessions and offices to their sons and left [[The Shire]] to visit [[Rohan]] where they stayed with [[King of Rohan|King]] [[Éomer]] for his last days. Then they moved to [[Gondor]] where they spent their last few years. Their bodies were placed in [[Rath Dínen]]; they were later laid beside King [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]] following his death in {{FoA|120}} ({{SR|1541}}).<ref name="later" />

==Etymology==
'''Peregrin''' is a translation of Pippin's [[Hobbitish]] name ''Razanur'', which was the name of a legendary traveller. It probably contains the [[Westron]] elements ''razan'' ("stranger"), ''raza'' ("foreign"), which is why [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] chose ''Peregrin'' to represent ''Razanur''.<ref name="PM">{{PM|Languages}}, manuscript F 2, On Translation, $49</ref> When Peregrin Took became Thain he was registered as '''Thain Peregrin I'''.<ref name="Took" />

The name ''[[wikipedia:Peregrine (name)|Peregrin]]'' is derived from Latin ''peregrinus'', which means "foreign". The term was used for a person who wandered abroad. The English word ''pilgrim'' is derived from the same root.<ref name="Jim Allen">{{HM|IE}}, The Giving of Names, p. 192</ref>

==Other names==
*'''[[wikipedia:Pippin (name)|Pippin]]''' is a 'pet-form' of ''Peregrin'' related to the Westron abbreviation ''[[Razar]]'' which is a type of small red [[apples|apple]].<ref name="PM"/>
*'''[[Razanur Tûk]]''' - Peregrin's true [[Westron]] name.<ref name="PM"/>
*"''Fool of a Took''" and "''Tom-fool of a Took''" - given to him by [[Gandalf]] for his often mischievous behaviour, and, in particular, for dropping a stone down the well in [[Moria]].<ref>{{FR|II4}}</ref>

*[[Guards of the Citadel|Guard of the Citadel]] - the office Pippin held when he swore fealty to [[Denethor]].<ref name="Minas" />

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the earliest drafts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' (see ''[[The History of The Lord of the Rings]]''), Frodo's counterpart Bingo Baggins was accompanied by his Took nephews, Frodo and Odo. They were similar characters but Odo was more limited and unaware than Frodo (Took) while Frodo was "more susceptible to the beauty and otherness of the Elves". Christopher Tolkien speculates that some aspects of Frodo Took have been preserved in Samwise Gamgee. Through a process that [[Christopher Tolkien]] described as "strangely torturous" these characters were gradually folded into the singular character of Peregrin Took.<ref>{{RS|1IIU}}</ref>

:After [[Gandalf]] encourages [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] to take [[The One Ring]] to [[Rivendell]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and Pippin decide they will accompany him. The [[Hobbits]] cross the main country road from [[Michel Delving]] to [[Bywater]] and go east through [[Green Hill Country]]. They flee the [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] on the road to [[Woodhall]], and the [[Bucklebury Ferry]]. They hide from the Riders and, after they leave, watch a group of dancing [[Elves]]. They camp with the Elves and eat food. The Hobbits decide to avoid all roads and take the path through the [[Old Forest]]. When camping for the night, they discover that Pippin has been completely swallowed by the [[Old Man Willow]] and Merry’s legs are sticking out. Frodo finds it impossible to set them free until helped by [[Tom Bombadil]]. Tom sings, which loosens the Tree, and pulls Merry and then Pippin out of the tree. The Hobbits continue on to [[Bree]] and meet Strider at the ''[[Prancing Pony|Prancing Pony Inn]]]''. After a letter from Gandalf tells that his true name is [[Aragorn]] and that he is to be trusted, the Hobbits join him on the way to Rivendell. Frodo is attacked by Black Riders on the way and [[Glorfindel]] heals him, though he is still injured, and gifts him his horse [[Asfaloth]]. The Hobbits arrive at Rivendell and Frodo awakens from his coma four days later. The Hobbits and the others in Rivendell hold a lively feast in celebration. The [[Council of Elrond]] convenes and they decide to take the Ring to [[Mordor]] and destroy it in the fire where it was created. A [[Fellowship of the Ring]] is formed, comrpising The Hobbits, Gandalf, Aragorn, [[Gimli]] and [[Legolas]]. Pippin departs third last, behind Merry and before Gimli. The Fellowship takes one final look at the House of [[Elrond]] and departs.
