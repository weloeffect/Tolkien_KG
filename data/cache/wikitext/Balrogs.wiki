{{Quote|... in Utumno he gathered his demons about him, those spirits who first adhered to him in the days of his splendour, and became most like him in his corruption: their hearts were of fire, but they were cloaked in darkness, and terror went before them; they had whips of flame.|''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]'', "[[Of the Coming of the Elves and the Captivity of Melkor]]"}}
The '''Balrogs''' were [[Maiar]] corrupted by [[Morgoth]] during the creation of [[Arda]], who cloaked themselves in shadow and flame and carried whips and swords. Famed Balrogs include [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]], slain by [[Ecthelion]], and [[Durin's Bane]], slain by [[Gandalf]].

==History==
Balrogs, also called [[Valaraukar]], were originally [[Ainur]] created by [[Ilúvatar]], probably those who joined [[Melkor]] during his discordance in the [[Music of the Ainur]]. After entering into [[Eä]], they were [[Maiar]], lesser spirits at the service of the [[Valar]].

{{blockquote|...of the Maiar many were drawn to [Melkor's] splendour in the days of his greatness, and remained in that allegiance down into his darkness; and others he corrupted afterwards to his service with lies and treacherous gifts. Dreadful among these spirits were the Valaraukar, the scourges of fire that in Middle-earth were called the Balrogs, demons of terror.|''[[Valaquenta]]'': Of the Enemies}}

They took the [[Fana|forms]] of demons with hearts of fire and whips of flame. Melkor gathered them about him after the fall of the [[Two Lamps]] and they dwelt in [[Utumno]].<ref>{{S|3}}</ref> When this fortress was destroyed by the [[Valar]], they fled to the west and hid in the pits of [[Angband]], awaiting their master's return.<ref name="Return">{{S|9}}</ref>

When [[Morgoth]] and [[Ungoliant]] escaped from [[Valinor]] many years later with the [[Silmarils]], the Balrogs were still awaiting their master in Angband. After Ungoliant threatened Morgoth, his cry was heard by them. Then the Balrogs issued from their hiding-place and traveled to [[Lammoth]] like a tempest of fire. With their whips they destroyed Ungoliant's webs and made her take flight.<ref name="Return">{{S|9}}</ref>

The Balrogs were first encountered by the Elves during the [[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]] ("Battle under the Stars") when the [[Noldor]]in [[Exile of the Noldor|Exiles]] [[Return of the Noldor|returned]] to [[Middle-earth]] at the end of the [[First Age]].<ref>{{App|Elves}}, p. 1128</ref> After the victory of the Noldor over Morgoth's forces, the Elf Lord [[Fëanor]] pressed on towards [[Angband]], but the Balrogs came up against him. He was surrounded and fought long against them before being mortally wounded by [[Gothmog (balrog)|Gothmog]], Lord of the Balrogs. Though Fëanor's sons fought off the demons of fire, Fëanor died of his wounds soon after.<ref>{{S|13}}</ref>

During the [[Wars of Beleriand]], Morgoth only came out of Angband on [[Fall of Fingolfin|one occasion]]. Instead, he sent the Balrogs to fight and lead in battle. Two of them were killed in the [[Fall of Gondolin]]: Gothmog by [[Ecthelion]], and another by [[Glorfindel]].<ref>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>

After the [[War of Wrath]], some Balrogs escaped the destruction of [[Beleriand]] and hid deep underground, in inaccessible places at the roots of the earth.<ref group="note">At the height of his power, Morgoth's successor [[Sauron]] was said to have reigned over all foul things, perhaps even some of the surviving Balrogs, but there is no evidence of this.</ref> Only one Balrog appears after the defeating of [[Morgoth]]: In the Third Age the [[Dwarves]] of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] unwittingly released the Balrog, afterwards known as [[Durin's Bane]], while mining for ''[[mithril]]'' and were driven out of Moria by the creature.<ref>{{App|Durin}}, pp. 1071-2</ref> Encountered by the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], it was faced by [[Gandalf]] and the two Maiar slew one another.<ref>{{TT|III5}}, pp. 501-2</ref>

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Balrog.mp3|Ardamir}}
''Balrog'' is [[Sindarin]] for "Demon of Might", from the [[root]] ''[[BAL]]'' ("power") + ''[[raug]]/[[rog]]'' ("demon").<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entries ''rauko'', ''val''</ref> The demonym was '''''Balrogath'''''.<ref>{{MR|P2f}}, p. 79</ref>

In the earlier [[Noldorin]] phase of the language, the word ''Balrog'' was derived from baul ("torment") + rhaug ("demon"), from [[Primitive Elvish]] ''ñgwalaraukô''.<ref name="Etymologies">{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries "[[ÑGWAL]]", "[[RUK]]"</ref>

==Other names==
The [[Quenya]] form is '''''Valarauko''''' (plural ''Valaraukar'').<ref>{{PE|17}}, entry S '''Balrog''', p. 48</ref>

In the Quenya from ''[[The Etymologies]]'', the form was ''malarauko''.<ref name="Etymologies" />

A list of [[Old English]] equivalents of [[Elvish]] words, glosses ''Balrog'' as having the equivalent ''Bealuwearg'' and ''Bealubroga''. As noted by [[Christopher Tolkien]], the Old English word contains the elements ''bealu'' ("evil"; as in ''bale(ful)'') and ''wearg'' ("wolf, outlaw") or ''broga'' ("terror").<ref>{{SM|QA1}}, p. 209</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
===The Book of Lost Tales===
In the earliest version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', the Balrogs are mentioned in some of the tales, but they only play an important role in the first that was written, in "[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]".<ref>{{LT2|In}}, p. 67</ref> Here some of the details remained later versions, while others were omitted: "Now these were demons with whips of flame and claws of steel by whom he tormented those of the [[Noldoli]] who durst withstand with him in anything – and the [[Eldar]] have called them Malkarauki."<ref name="Gondolin">{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|169}} They were attired with iron armour and helm.<ref name="Gondolin" />{{rp|181, 194}}

===Number===
The Balrogs were originally envisioned as being immense in number:
{{blockquote|The early conception of Balrogs makes them less terrible, and certainly more destructible, than they afterwards became: they existed in 'hundreds' (p. 170), and were slain by [[Tuor]] and the [[Gondothlim]] in large numbers: "thus five fell before Tuor's great axe [[Dramborleg]], three before [[Ecthelion]]'s sword, and two score were slain by the warriors of the king's house.|''[[The Book of Lost Tales: Part Two]]'', commentary by Christopher Tolkien on "[[The Fall of Gondolin (chapter)|The Fall of Gondolin]]", pp. 212-3}}
{{blockquote|There came wolves and serpents and there came Balrogs one thousand, and there came Glomund the Father of Dragons.|''[[The Lost Road and Other Writings]]'', ''Quenta Silmarillion'', Chapter 16, §15}}

As the [[legendarium]] became more formidable and internally consistent, and the Balrogs more terrible, this number was much reduced. In the end Tolkien stated that there were probably "at most" seven Balrogs:
{{blockquote|In the margin my father wrote: 'There should not be supposed more than say 3 or at most 7 ever existed.'|''[[Morgoth's Ring]]'', Section 2 (AAm*): note 50}}

It should, however, be noted that these texts postdate the published ''The Lord of the Rings'', but predate the materials from which the published ''The Silmarillion'' was drawn. The exact number of Balrogs is therefore very uncertain, but Tolkien's note above seems to have been his final word.

===The Lays of Beleriand===
A Balrog named [[Lungorthin]] is mentioned only once in ''[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]''. After [[Húrin]] was captured by [[Morgoth]], Lungorthin smote him on the mouth. <ref>{{LB|1}}, pp. 98, 102-3</ref>

According to [[Christopher Tolkien]], it is likely that Lungorthin is not another name for [[Gothmog]], as the name Gothmog was mentioned in the earliest Middle-earth writings, as well as the final version of Tolkien's mythology.

{{Blockquote|The ''thane of Morgoth'' who smote him on the mouth (version I, 59) now becomes ''Lungorthin'', ''Lord of Balrogs'' (96)——which is probably to be interpreted as ‘a Balrog lord’, since Gothmog, reappears in the ‘Silmarillion’ tradition.|''[[The Lays of Beleriand]]'', ''[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]'', [[Christopher Tolkien|Christopher Tolkien’s]] ''Commentary on Part I of the second version''}}

'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:The Balrog has wings and appears capable of limited flight. The head resembles a lion but the rest of the body was rendered in matte black, a technique commonly used for shadowy surreal effect in rotoscope animation.

'''1984: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''
:Beyond Gothmog, Durin's Bane, and Lungorthin, the game also features the newly-invented Balrog [[Múar]].

'''2001: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'':'''
:Durin's Bane is described as having flame and shadow in the shape of wings. In a departure from this description, [[Peter Jackson|Jackson]]'s Demon of Might has literal wings, an elongated tail, a horned head, clawed forearms and hoofed feet, all of which are seen clearly from its smoke-engulfed physique. It's also notably larger than previous depictions, being well over the height of a grown man.

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:The Balrog has, once again, wings. The fight sequence, in which the player is Gandalf, takes considerably longer: only after a short fight on the bridge does Gandalf let it collapse.

'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''
:The chase up the [[Endless Stair]] and the slime Balrog were omitted due to budget constraints.{{fact}} However, part of Gandalf's battle with the Balrog is shown at the beginning of the film, and the fight atop Zirak-Zigil is seen in a flashback after Gandalf's return.

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring|Sierra's The War of the Ring]]'':'''
:The Balrog is the most powerful magical power available to Servants of Sauron. They have horns and wings.

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age]]'':'''
:The players assist Gandalf in his fight with the Balrog.

'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'':'''
:The Balrog is the most powerful magical power available to both Mordor and Isengard faction, and is faced as a boss in the Good Campaign. Visual appearance follows the movie version.

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:Unlike the original game, The Balrog is not available to Isengard faction, but only to Mordor and the new Goblin factions.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Besides [[Durin's Bane]], the game also features another Balrog: named Thaurlach, he can be found in the [[Rift of Nûrz Ghâshu]], where [[Angmar]] meets [[Misty Mountains]]. He fled there are the breaking of [[Thangorodrim]], but was followed by an elf-maiden Glathlírel who was determined to end him. The Balrog eluded her for millennia, until she was able to face him in combat and defeat him. Rather than kill the Balrog, the two Blue Wizards decided to imprison him in the Rift, so that he could await his judgment at the end of days. However, by the end of the Third Age his chains were loosening and a band of players was sent to defeat the weakened Balrog - something, that as Gandalf remarked, should have been done ages ago.

'''2009: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'':'''
:The Balrog is one of the "heroes" available to Servants of Sauron during evil campaign. Appearance reflects the movie version.

'''2017: ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]]'':'''
:The game also features another Balrog: named Tar Goroth, who must be killed to complete a specific side-quest, has wings and is able to leap over large distances without flying.

'''2022: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'', Season One'''
:'''Episode 5: ''[[Partings]]'':'''
::In the [[The Song of the Roots of Hithaeglir|obscure apocryphal myth]] that the [[Gil-galad|High King Gil-galad]] compels [[Elrond]] to recount, the Balrog depicted within the visual representation of the story has distintive wings covered by smoke.
:'''Episode 7: ''[[The Eye]]'':'''
::When [[Durin III|King Durin III]] throws an orange leaf of the Great Tree in [[Lindon]] down the [[mithril]] mine shaft before ordering the mine to be sealed up, the leaf fell to the very depths of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] beneath the Mithril vein. As the leaf lands, it catches on fire due to being in close proximity to the Balrog later known as Durin's Bane. Upon being disturbed, the Balrog roars. Whether this roar was out of anger or annoyance is not known.
