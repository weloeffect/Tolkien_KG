'''Jenny Dolfen''' (born [[1975]]) is a German artist and teacher. 
==History==
Dolfen was introduced to Tolkien's works via her mother, who was an avid fan.<ref>"Acuarelas innumerables: Entrevista a Jenny Dolfen" in ''Dragón Verde 10''</ref> Her artwork gained notoriety in the early 2000s because it depicted events from [[The Silmarillion]], which was not very common at the time.<ref name=tor>[https://www.tor.com/2022/11/17/the-art-of-middle-earth-the-elves-feanoreans-and-glucksdrachen-of-jenny-dolfen/ The Art of Middle-earth: The Elves, Fëanoreans, and Glücksdrachen of Jenny Dolfen] on tor.com (accessed 16 July 2023)</ref>

She is a regular guest at Tolkien-related events, having spoken at artist panels at [[The Return of the Ring]], [[Tolkien Thing]] 2013, and [[Tolkien 2019]].

In 2018, she was diagnosed with an unknown eye disease<ref>Jenny Dolfen, [https://goldseven.wordpress.com/blog/page/3/''"This Hither Shore"''] on goldseven.wordpress.com (accessed 17 July 2023)</ref> that has since made her visually disabled. She "works around" her condition by using magnifying glasses and digital canvases.<ref name=tor /> When asked about her disability's impact on her art, she said: "''[T]here have been times over the past four years when I felt that I couldn’t keep creating, but I’ve always found a way to get back again—I think creating is my default mode, and no matter how hard creating may be, not creating always ends up being harder!''"<ref name=tor />
