==History==
Hending was the fourth child of [[Holman the greenhanded]].<ref>{{App|Gamgee}}</ref>
==Etymology==
The name in Middle English means "courteous, skillful one".<ref>[[Jim Allan]] (ed.), ''[[An Introduction to Elvish]]'', "Giving of Names"</ref> In ''[[Gerald of Wales on the Survival of Welsh]]'', Tolkien equates the name "Hending" — nominally the author of a compilation of traditional proverbs that end with "quoth Hending" —  with the Welsh "henddyn", the typical wise old man.<ref>[[Mark T. Hooker]], ''[[Tolkien and Welsh]]'' p. 194</ref>
