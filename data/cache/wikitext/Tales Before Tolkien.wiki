==From the publisher==
{{blockquote|For those interested in [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s sources comes Tales Before Tolkien: The Roots of Modern Fantasy, edited by [[Douglas A. Anderson]] ([[The Annotated Hobbit]]), which collects 22 classic stories by such masters as [[George MacDonald]], [[Andrew Lang]], [[Lord Dunsany]] and [[James Branch Cabell]]. Arthur Machen aficionados will especially appreciate "The Coming of the Terror" (an abridgement of his short novel The Terror), hitherto unreprinted since its initial magazine appearance in 1917.
