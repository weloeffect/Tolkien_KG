'''Dwalin''' was a [[Dwarves|Dwarf]] of the [[House of Durin]]. Along with his brother, [[Balin]], Dwalin was a member of [[Thorin and Company|Thorin's company]] in the [[Quest of Erebor]], an attempt to reclaim the [[Lonely Mountain]] from the [[dragon]] [[Smaug]]. Dwalin survived the adventure and the subsequent [[Battle of Five Armies]], and lived in wealth and splendour in the Lonely Mountain well into the [[Fourth Age]].

==History==
===Early history===
Two years before Dwalin was born, in {{TA|2770}}, the dragon Smaug attacked the kingdom of Erebor,<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> and destroyed the settlement and the nearby city of [[Dale]], taking the gold of the mountain as his own. In the aftermath of destruction, King [[Thrór]] and a small group of his surviving kinsmen headed south while other [[Dwarves of Erebor]] escaped to the [[Iron Hills]].<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref> Because of this, Dwalin was born in exile, possibly in [[Dunland]] to [[Fundin]] in {{TA|2772}} nine years after his brother, Balin.

===War of the Dwarves and Orcs===
After years of living in Dunland, a despondent Thrór made a journey to Moria, where an orc cheiftan, [[Azog]], slaughtered him. In retaliation, [[Thráin II]], now King of Durin's Folk, waged war. A 27-year-old Dwalin participated in the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]], where, amid battle, Fundin and several other kinsman were slain. Despite this, the war was won. After the victory, Thráin was counselled by [[Dáin Ironfoot]] not to enter [[Moria|Khazad-Dûm]], so, Thráin and his son [[Thorin|Thorin Oakenshield]] settled in the [[Blue Mountains|Ered Luin]].<ref name="Line">{{App|Durin}}, The Line of the Dwarves of Erebor</ref> At some point, Dwalin and Balin joined Thráin in the Blue Mountains, along with the other survivors of the war.

===King Thráin's expedition===
In {{TA|2841}}, Dwalin, Balin and a few other dwarves accompanied Thráin when he left the Ered Luin to reclaim his lost homeland, Erebor. The small party was dogged by the emissaries of the dark lord, [[Sauron]], because Thráin carried one of the seven dwarven rings of power. In {{TA|2845}}, Thráin and the rest of the company were separated by a black rain in the eaves of the dark forest, [[Mirkwood]]. Unbeknonwst to Dwalin and the company, Thráin had been captured by Sauron. After a fruitless search for their leader the Dwarves gave up and returned to inform Thorin of the mision's failure, who became the new King of Durin's Folk.<ref name="Durin"/>

===Quest for Erebor===
[[File:Adlpictures - Dwalin.jpg|left|200px|thumb|''Dwalin'' by Adlpictures]]
A century later, in {{TA|2941}}, Dwalin and Balin joined Thorin's expedition to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Per the instructions of the wizard, [[Gandalf]], they were invited to a [[smial]] named [[Bag End]], which is located in the [[the Shire]], to form their plan. Dwalin was the first dwarf to arrive, alone, when the unexpected party began at the hobbit, which was owned by [[Bilbo Baggins]]. He was wearing a dark-green hood and walked in as if expected and hung his hood on one of Bilbo's pegs. A greatly surprised hobbit invited Dwalin to tea. Soon, Balin arrived and he and Dwalin sat talking while Bilbo kept answering the door for the arrival of more and more Dwarves. Later, when Bilbo griped aloud in his kitchen about the lack of help in setting out refreshments, Dwalin and Balin were the first dwarves to lend a hand. Later still, when Thorin called for music, Dwalin and Balin said that they forgot their instruments on the porch and are sent by Thorin to bring his instrument as well. When they returned; Dwalin and Balin brought viols as large as themselves and Thorin's harp.<ref name="Party">{{H|Party}}</ref> 

The next day, the company met at the [[Green Dragon]] Inn. When Bilbo told the company that he had forgotten to bring his hat or his pocket-handkerchief, Dwalin gave him his spare dark-green hood and cloak to keep in place of a hat, but told him that he would "''have to manage without pocket-handkerchiefs, and a good many other things before the journey's end''". Soon afterward, Gandalf arrived and brought several of Bilbo's assortments. 

In [[Eriador]], at the [[Trollshaws]], Dwalin along with the entire company were captured by [[Trolls]] after Bilbo went to explore a fire. The three trolls: [[William]], [[Bert]] and [[Tom]] soon began to argue among themselves, and Gandalf managed to save them. Shortly afterward, the company located and looted the nearby troll cave.

Later on, the company arrived at [[Rivendell]] and stayed with the [[half-elven]] lord [[Elrond]] for about 14 days with food and something for everyone. On one night Elrond disclosed the swords Thorin and Gandalf found in the troll-hoard as [[Orcrist]] and [[Glamdring]]. Elrond also read the moon letters of the map of Thror, which read: ''"Stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks, and the setting sun with the last light of Durin's Day will shine upon the key-hole.''"

After seeking refuge from a storm in a cave which was, unbeknownst to them the [[Front Porch]] of [[Goblin-town]], they were captured by [[Goblins]]. They were saved by Gandalf, and Bilbo, fleeing after his encounter with [[Gollum]], also escaped. The company were then chased by [[Wargs]] and they rushed into the trees. Dwalin and Balin managed to swarm up a tall slender fir that had few branches for sitting, and they were later then saved by the [[Eagles]] of the [[Great Eagle]].<ref>{{H|Pan}}</ref>  The next day, when the company arrived at [[Beorn]]'s hall after the eagles left them on the [[Carrock]], Dwalin and Balin were the third pair of Dwarves to appear during Gandalf's story, trying to intrigue the skin-changer. They were later served well in dinner and breakfast and were also given ponies to ride until they arrived at the forest of Mirkwood, the same place where Thráin was lost nearly 100 years before.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>

At the [[Enchanted River]] in Mirkwood, Dwalin was in the last boatload to cross with [[Bombur]].  He exited the boat just before a deer charged down the path and caused Bombur to fall in the water, which put him in an enchanted sleep for six days, and when he woke up, he had forgotten the whole journey.  Later, after the Dwarves had been captured by the [[spiders]] and rescued by Bilbo, it was Dwalin who first realised that Thorin was missing,<ref name="Flies">{{H|Flies}}</ref> for at that point, though unknown to the Dwarves, Thorin had been captured by the Wood-Elves. 

At the opening of the barrels after the escape from the halls of the [[Thranduil|Elvenking]], Dwalin and Balin were two of the most unhappy Dwarves and did nothing to help pull out other Dwarves as they arrived in [[Lake-town]], where they were greeted extremely fondly.<ref>{{H|Welcome}}</ref> Afterwards, though the [[Master of Lake-town]] didn't believe that Thorin was truly the [[King under the Mountain]], they left for the mountain. When the last week of autumn arrived it was Dwalin who complained the most about Bilbo's inactivity.  He felt that Bilbo, with his "invisible ring", ought to go through the [[Front Gate]] of Erebor and spy things out.<ref>{{H|Doorstep}}</ref>

After [[Smaug]] went to destroy Lake-town, the dwarves entered and Thorin's search for the [[Arkenstone]] began. Dwalin later fought in and survived the [[Battle of Five Armies]] along with several others from the company (all but Thorin and Fíli and Kíli).  Afterwards he received his fourteenth share and chose to live in Erebor under the rule of Thorin's cousin and new king after his death, [[Dáin II]].<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>

===Later life===
Dwalin lived in great wealth in Erebor after the Battle of the Five Armies. In {{TA|2989}}, his brother Balin set out on a quest to reclaim [[Moria]] though Dáin was against it. He set out with others (such as [[Óin]] and [[Ori]]). For about 5 years messages came from Moria and it seemed good, until suddenly news stopped (though unknown to him, the colony was destroyed by [[Orcs]]).

As Bilbo packed some oddments in {{TA|3001}} before departing the Shire, Bilbo brought Dwalin's green hood he had given him, though the colour had worn out. Dwalin was one of seven of the ten Dwarves of Thorin's company who were still living in Erebor when [[Frodo Baggins]] came to [[Rivendell]], as reported by [[Glóin]] before the [[Council of Elrond]].<ref>{{FR|II1}}</ref> It is possible that he fought in the [[Battle of Dale]] against Sauron's forces, the [[Easterlings]], under King Dáin (though the king was slain). Dwalin lived until {{FoA|91}}, passing at the age of 340,<ref name="Line"/>

==Etymology==
In [[Norse mythology]], ''Dvalinn'' is a chief Dwarf.<ref>Snorri Sturlusson, ''Prose Edda'', "[[wikipedia:Skaldskaparmal|Skaldskaparmal]]"</ref> The origin of the name is uncertain; suggested etymologies are "one lying in a trance",<ref>[[Ruth S. Noel]], ''[[The Languages of Tolkien's Middle-earth]]'', p. 32</ref> "numb" and "dawdler".<ref>Henry A. Bellows (ed.), ''Völuspá'', "[http://cybersamurai.net/Mythology/nordic_gods/LegendsSagas/Edda/PoeticEdda/Voluspo.htm Poetic Edda]"</ref> Both words, ''dvalen'' ("to sleep") ''dvelja'' ("to delay") derive from the same root.<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the early version of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', it was Dwalin rather than Balin who spotted the Trolls' fire in the woods (and it was stated that Dwalin was always the Dwarves' look-out).<ref>{{HH|Trolls}}, p. 91</ref> This contradicted the fact that Balin was the Dwarf who was looking for Bilbo at the inn at the start of the adventure<ref>{{HH|Trolls}}, p. 89</ref> and Tolkien eventually made Balin the permanent look-out. However, Dwalin remained the first Dwarf to arrive at Bag End<ref name="Party"/> (what would be expected of the Company's look-out). Dwalin was also the first to notice that Thorin was missing after the battle with the spiders,<ref name="Flies"/> a testament to his observational abilities.
