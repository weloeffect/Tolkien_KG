'''Thorin's hall'''<ref name=UT>{{UT|9b}}, typescript B</ref> was the main western realm of [[Durin's Folk]], led by King [[Thráin|Thráin II]] and later [[Thorin|Thorin II Oakenshield]].  

==Location==
Thorin's hall was located on the east side<ref name=Durin>{{App|Durin}}, p. 1079</ref> in the South of the [[Blue Mountains]]<ref name=TA>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2799, p. 1088</ref> "beyond" the [[Lhûn|Lune]].<ref name=Durin/><ref name=TA/> It is not clear from which point of view beyond the river Lune Thorin's hall was located. From a point of view north of the [[Gulf of Lune]] [[Harlindon]] lies beyond the Lune and the Blue Mountains continue south of the Gulf of Lune. The people of Thorin had fair halls in the mountains, stores of goods and a forge where Thorin worked with iron on an anvil.<ref name=UT/>

==History==
===Establishment and Thráin's reign===
Several years after the [[Sack of Erebor]] by the dragon [[Smaug]], the exiled [[Kings of Durin's Folk|King of Durin's folk]] [[Thrór]] was murdered by [[Orcs]]. [[Thráin|Thráin II]] led a host of Dwarves from his and other house in a [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs|great war]] against the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]]. After that, Thráin's people moved to the hills of [[Dunland]] and stayed for some time before moving to the [[Blue Mountains]] and established their hall in the year {{TA|2802}}. 

For nearly forty years Thráin ruled his people in the Ered Luin but was driven to obsession by his [[Ring of Thrór|ring of power]]. In {{TA|2841|n}} he left with a small group of followers to return to the Erebor determined to kill Smaug and take his father's realm back. But in {{TA|2845|n}} while encamped on the eves of [[Mirkwood]] Thráin was captured by the servants of the [[Necromancer]] and taken to [[Dol Guldur]]; where he was tortured till his death many years later. His followers including [[Balin]] and [[Dwalin]] did not know his fate, and after searching for days they returned to the Ered Luin.

===Thorin's rule===
Thorin was made the ruler of Durin's folk, and under his leadership, his people prospered, their trade increased as well as their numbers, not only from birth but wandering Longbeards heard of Thorin's realm and came to him.

Thorin ruled in the Ered Luin for nearly one hundred years, until he met [[Gandalf]] the Wizard who helped him concoct a plan to take back Erebor from Smaug; he left his halls for the last time on a [[Quest of Erebor|quest to take back his former home]]. After many months [[Thorin and Company]] took the mountain as theirs and Thorin declared himself [[King under the Mountain]] after Smaug was killed; but after a [[Battle of Five Armies|great battle]] with Orcs and [[Wargs]] Thorin was mortally wounded and died, never being able to enjoy the realm he gained.

===Dissolvement as the Capital===
After Thorin's death, his cousin [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin II Ironfoot]] of the [[Iron Hills]] became king of Durin's folk; and when news reached [[Dwarves of the Blue Mountains|Durin's folk in the Ered Luin]] that Erebor was retaken, it is believed that most of them moved to the Lonely Mountain. Therefore, Thorin's hall became a sub-realm of Durin's folk.

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In an abandoned attempt to rewrite ''[[The Hobbit]]'' in the style of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' in 1960 before the publication of the second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' and the third edition of ''The Hobbit'' in 1966 the home of Thorin in exile was said to be in the west-side of the Blue Mountains in the southern part in Harlindon.<ref name=HH>{{HH|T1}}, '''Itinerary''', entry 1. April 28.</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations== 
'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:'''Thorin's Hall''' is one of the major cities in the game. Following the death of Thorin, many [[Durin's Folk|Longbeards]] move away and the rule of Thorin's Hall falls to the [[Dourhands]]: a group of Blue Mountain Dwarves who are the descendants of the [[Petty-dwarves]]. In {{TA|3016}} [[King under the Mountain|King]] [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin]] sends a company of Longbeards to investigate the Dourhands, which results in the rogue dwarves being thrown out and [[Dwalin]] becoming the Steward of Thorin's Hall.

:Thorin's Hall is the default location for Dwarf characters to begin their journey in Middle-Earth: the city itself is safe from dangers, but outlying outposts face the threats of wild beasts, remaining Dourhands and occasional [[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|Goblins]].
