'''''Rosalind Ramage''''' refers to a [[Index:Poems by J.R.R. Tolkien|poem]] written by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. The poem was "''written for an American girl named Rosalind Ramage who had written Tolkien a fan letter in October [[1964]]''". Tolkien submitted the poem, together with "[[The Dragon's Visit]]" and "[[Once upon a Time]]", for publication in ''[[Winter's Tales for Children 1]]''. Due to lack of space, only the two latter poems were included in the children's anthology.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Douglas A.

==Poem excerpt==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
One spring afternoon,
like a baloon
far Rosalind
was blown by the wind,
till she was high
up in the sky.
