'''Half-orcs''' were among [[Saruman]]'s servants in the late [[Third Age]].<ref name=TTIII9>{{TT|III9}}</ref>

Saruman's servants also included creatures known as [[Goblin-men]] who appeared to blend the traits of [[Men]] and [[Orcs]], but they were a different breed.<ref>{{TT|III7}}, [[Gamling]]: ''But these creatures of Isengard, these '''half-orcs''' and '''goblin-men''' that the foul craft of Saruman has bred.''</ref>

==History==
The origin and nature of the half-orcs is unknown. In the [[Third Age]], apparently Saruman learned that it was possible to mate [[Men]] with Orcs. Thus he created half-orcs and goblin-men who served him. Unlike ordinary Orcs, half-orcs were unbothered by sunlight.<ref>{{TT|III7}}</ref>

The [[Squint-eyed southerner]] from [[Dunland]] was possibly a half-orc.<ref name=Knife>{{FR|I11}}</ref>

Half-orcs were among the [[Dunlendings]] who came to Saruman's banner of the [[White Hand]] in [[Isengard]].<ref name=TTIII9/> Many were counted among the strongest servants of Saruman. The half-orcs mostly perished at the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], either before the fortress walls or by the [[Huorns]]. 

More Half-orcs later followed [[Saruman]] into exile, and were among his [[Ruffians]] who occupied [[the Shire]].<ref>{{RK|VI8}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
Concerning the origin of the half-orcs, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] suggested late in his life that: 
{{Blockquote|It became clear in time that undoubted Men could under the domination of [[Morgoth]] or his agents in a few generations be reduced almost to the Orc-level of mind and habits; and then they would or could be made to mate with Orcs, producing new breeds, often larger and more cunning. There is no doubt that long afterwards, in the [[Third Age]], Saruman rediscovered this, or learned of it in lore, and in his lust for mastery committed this, his wickedest deed: the interbreeding of Orcs and Men, producing both Men-orcs large and cunning, and Orc-men treacherous and vile.<ref name=myths>{{MR|P5X}}, pp. 418-9</ref>}}
