'''''The Peoples of Middle-earth''''', published in [[1996]], is the twelfth and final volume of [[Christopher Tolkien]]'s 12-volume book series, ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', in which he analyzes the unpublished manuscripts of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].

This book covers the development of the [[The Prologue|Prologue]] and [[The Lord of the Rings Appendices|Appendices]] of ''The Lord of the Rings'', information on [[Elvish]] tongues and other [[languages]] of Middle-earth as provided by [[Pengolodh|Pengoloð]], and two stories Tolkien didn't finish: [[The New Shadow]] (a quickly-abandoned sequel to ''TLotR'') and an account of [[Númenóreans]] of which [[Tal-Elmar (character)|Tal-Elmar]] is the protagonist.

==Inscriptions==
There is an inscription in the [[Tengwar]] characters in the first pages of every ''History of Middle-earth'' volume, written by Christopher Tolkien and describing the contents of the book. The inscription in Book XII reads:

:"''This is the last volume of the work of Christopher Tolkien in which he has collected a great part of all that his father John Ronald Reuel Tolkien wrote of Middle-earth and Valinor. In this book is traced the devising of the history of the later ages in the Northwest of Middle-earth after the [[War of Wrath|Great Battle]] and the Fall of [[Morgoth]].''"

==From the publisher==
{{blockquote|The concluding volume of The History of Middle-earth series, which examines the Appendices to The Lord of the Rings.<br>
The Peoples of Middle-earth traces the evolution of the Appendices to The Lord of The Rings, which provide a comprehensive historical structure of the Second and Third Ages, including Calendars, Hobbit genealogies and the [[Westron]] language. The book concludes with two unique abandoned stories: [[The New Shadow]], set in Gondor during the Fourth Age, and the [[Tal-Elmar|tale of Tal-Elmar]], in which the coming of the dreaded Númenórean ships is seen through the eyes of men of Middle-earth in the Dark Years.<br>
With the publication of this book, the long history of J.R.R. Tolkien’s creation is completed and the enigmatic state of his work can be understood.}}
