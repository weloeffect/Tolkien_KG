{{letter|127}}
==Summary== 
[[Stanley Unwin]] had asked his son [[Rayner Unwin|Rayner]] for advice about publishing ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Silmarillion]]''. Rayner proposed publishing the former and dropping the latter. 

Tolkien became angry by the corporate thinking of Unwin and his son, and demanded an immediate "yes" or "no" about publishing both books. 

;In the expanded edition
At the end Tolkien notes that he hadn't seen the article to which Unwin referred, and once again says that his health issues had prevented him from replying sooner.

==Note==
This letter marked the beginning of a feud Tolkien had with [[Allen and Unwin|Allen & Unwin]], and several letters later prompted him to write the "[[Letter 131|Milton Waldman Letter]]". For more on this episode, see [[Humphrey Carpenter]]'s ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]'', part ''VI 1949-1966: Success'', chapter 1, "Slamming the Gates".
