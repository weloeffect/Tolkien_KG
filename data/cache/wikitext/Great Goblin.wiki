The '''Great Goblin''' was the chief of the [[Orcs#Orcs and goblins|Orcs]] who dwelt in [[Goblin-town]] beneath the [[High Pass]], and presumably was the leader of all the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]].<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Great Goblin"</ref> He was described as "tremendous" and had a huge head.<ref name="Hill">{{H|Hill}}</ref>

== History ==
In {{TA|2941}},<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> [[Thorin and Company]] were captured by the Great Goblin's people after taking refuge in a [[Front Porch|cave]] while crossing the [[Misty Mountains]]. When the [[Dwarves]] and [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] were hauled before the Great Goblin he questioned them regarding their intentions, while accusing them of being spies, thieves, murderers, and friends of [[Elves]]. When one of his guards showed the Great Goblin [[Thorin]]'s sword, [[Orcrist]], he howled with rage and rushed at Thorin with open mouth. At that moment all of the lights in the cave were extinguished and a flashing sword stabbed the Great Goblin fatally. The company soon realized that it was [[Gandalf]] who had killed the Great Goblin with his blade [[Glamdring]].<ref name="Hill"/>

== Legacy ==
The death of the Great Goblin - along with Gandalf's ploy of introducing Thorin's company only a few at a time - tickled [[Beorn]]'s fancy enough to gain the Company access to his hall and hospitality. Once Beorn confirmed their tale he warmed up to true friendship and provided the party with aid, advice, and mounts to ride to the border of [[Mirkwood]].<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref>

A further consequence of the Great Goblin's demise was a rekindling of the Orcs' hatred towards Dwarves, which led to preparations for war to secure domination of the North. The Orcs assembled at Mount [[Gundabad]] and were about to sweep southward when they learned of the death of [[Smaug]]. Altering their plans, the Orcs marched by night through the mountains and appeared unexpectedly at [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], almost immediately after the arrival of [[Dáin Ironfoot]], and participated in the [[Battle of Five Armies]].<ref>{{H|Burst}}</ref>
