The '''Master of Lake-town''' was the title given to the leader of [[Lake-town]] during the late [[Third Age]].<ref name=Return>{{H|Return}}</ref>

==History==
===Prior to and after the arrival of Thorin and Company===
According to the Master who held this title at the arrival of [[Thorin and Company]] in Lake-town in {{TA|2941}}, the masters had always been elected from among the old and wise.<ref name=Fire>{{H|Fire}}</ref>
[[File:Frank Kelley Freas - Master of Esgaroth.jpg|thumb|200px|left|"Master of [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]]" by Frank Kelley Freas]]
During the [[Quest of Erebor]] in {{TA|2941}}, when [[Thorin and Company]] arrived in Lake-town, they were taken by the [[captain of the guard]] through the market-place to a [[Great House|great hall]] where the current Master was feasting. Subsequently, Thorin declared the return of the [[King under the Mountain]]. This news spread quickly throughout the town and the people began to shout, sing, and rejoice.

The Master doubted that there ever was a 'King under the Mountain' but he had to take heed of the clamour. Therefore, he pretended to believe Thorin's story and yielded his own great chair to him. The Master accommodated the Dwarves and [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]] for two weeks before they thought about departing for the [[Lonely Mountain]]. The Master was shocked that Thorin would dare to approach [[Smaug]] and he wondered whether he really was who he said he was. All the same, he was more than willing to let them go because they were expensive to keep and their arrival had caused business to come to a standstill. Alongside his [[councillors]], the Master "bade them farewell from the great steps of the town-hall".<ref name=Welcome>{{H|Welcome}}</ref>

===Smaug’s attack===
[[File:Lída Holubová - Crooked (Inktober 2017).jpg|thumb|200px|right|"Crooked" by [[Lída Holubová]]]]
When Smaug attacked Lake-town, the people urged the Master to tell them what needed to be done. But as the flames leaped from the dragon's jaw, the Master fled in his gilded boat. Thus it was that [[Bard]] took control of the situation and ultimately slew the dragon himself. 

The surviving townsfolk gathered on the western shore of the [[Long Lake]] and lamented at the loss of their home. The people then directed their anger at the Master, accusing him of selfishness and calling him "Moneybags". They demanded that Bard become their king. In response, the Master, in a demonstration of his charisma and oratorical prowess, rebutted the people and convinced them that their anger should be directed towards Thorin and Company instead of him. The Master remained quiet as the survivors set up camps along the shore and Bard assumed effective control of all the people, but did so only in the Master's name. 

When the hosts of [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]] and the [[Thranduil|Elvenking]] set off for Erebor to demand their share in the treasure, the Master did not go. Those who stayed behind began to prepare for the oncoming winter by building huts and collecting resources; meanwhile, the Master directed the process of planning a new town.<ref name=Fire/>

===Aftermath of the Battle of Five Armies===
After the [[Battle of Five Armies]], Bard gave a large amount of gold to the Master to help the Lake-people. The Master caught the 'dragon-sickness', however, and stole most of the gold and fled with it from Lake-town.<ref name=Stage>{{H|Stage}}</ref> After his companions had deserted him, the Master starved to death in the [[Waste]]<ref name=Stage/> sometime between {{TA|2941}} and {{TA|2949|n}}.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entries for the years 2941 and 2949, p. 1089</ref><ref group="note">The old Master could have died any time between the end of the [[Quest of Erebor]] ({{TA|2941}}) and [[Gandalf]] and [[Balin|Balin's]] visit to Bilbo in {{TA|2949}}</ref> According to [[Balin]], the new Master of Lake-town was wiser and very popular, because the people gave him the credit for their prosperity, as much wealth went up and down the [[River Running]].<ref name=Stage/>

===Films===
'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:'''
:The Master of Lake-town was played by [[Stephen Fry]].<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Peter Jackson]]|articleurl=http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150257180211558|articlename=Casting News for The Hobbit|dated=19-May-2011|website=[http://www.facebook.com/ Facebook]|accessed=23-Dec-2011}}</ref> He is an incredibly corrupt, vain, and slovenly individual. Also becoming paranoid that the people of Lake-town may try to overthrow him, he uses his chief aide [[Alfrid Lickspittle]] to keep him abreast of the goings-on throughout the town. He sees Bard as the biggest threat to his power, and, knowing Bard is the descendant of [[Girion]], the last [[lord of Dale]], he uses every chance he can to exploit the fact that Girion was unable to bring down Smaug during the [[Dragons|Dragon]]'s destruction of [[Dale]]. When Thorin and Company arrive in the town, and [[Thorin]] promises the townspeople a share of their treasure if they succeed in taking back [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] from Smaug, the Master seizes this opportunity to approve of the Dwarves' quest in hopes of getting back into the townspeople's good graces, and when Bard tries to talk reason to the townspeople, humiliates and rebukes him. He gives the Company a hero's sendoff the following day. Later, he orders [[Braga]], the captain of the guard, to arrest and imprison Bard on any charge he chooses. When Smaug is in the process of destroying Lake-town, the Master, Alfrid, Braga, and a few other town guards attempt to make off with the town's treasury in a boat and let the others fend for themselves. To get the boat to go faster, the Master eventually pushes Alfrid overboard. After Smaug has been shot by Bard's [[Black Arrow]], the Dragon falls directly onto the Master's boat while plunging to his death into Long Lake, presumably taking everyone aboard with him.
