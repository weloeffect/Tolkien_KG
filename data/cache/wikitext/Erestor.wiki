'''Erestor''' was an [[Elves|Elf]] of [[Rivendell]], and the chief counsellor of [[Elrond]].

==History==
Erestor, being the chief counsellor of [[Elrond]]'s household at the time of the [[War of the Ring]], took part in the [[Council of Elrond]]. He did not support the idea of destroying [[The One Ring|the Ring]], and preferred instead the notion of guarding it from [[Sauron]], perhaps with the aid of [[Tom Bombadil|Iarwain ben-adar]]. His suggestion was countered by [[Glorfindel]], as well as [[Galdor of the Havens|Galdor]], as they did not believe that Iarwain had the power to defy Sauron's.<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref> 

Erestor accompanied [[Arwen]] to her marriage with [[Aragorn]] in [[Gondor]] in {{TA|3019}}.<ref>{{RK|Steward}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Erestor'' is in [[Sindarin]], but its meaning is unclear.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-337200237.html|articlename=S. ''Erestor'' m.|website=Eldamo|accessed=08 August 2023}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the earliest introduction of Erestor, he was one of three counsellors of Elrond's (the other two being unnamed); all three were kinsmen of Elrond's, "of that half-elvish folk whom the Elves named the children of [[Lúthien]]". In a further update, the other two were made into unnamed Elf-lords of Rivendell, with Erestor being the sole remaining half-elf and kinsman of Elrond.<ref>{{RS|Elrond}}</ref> However, Erestor is never called a half-elf in the finished text. 

In the initial selection for the Nine of the Company of the Ring, Erestor was to represent the half-Elves.<ref>{{TI|Ring}}</ref>

Originally, only Elrond, [[Galadriel]], and [[Celeborn]] accompany Arwen to her wedding.<ref>{{SD|Vs}}</ref>
