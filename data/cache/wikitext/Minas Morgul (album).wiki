'''''Minas Morgul''''' is the second full-length album by [[Summoning]] and was released in [[1995]]. The name is a reference to the fallen city of [[Minas Morgul]], formerly the twin city of [[Minas Tirith]] called Minas Ithil.  Despite being released after [[Lugburz (album)|Lugburz]], fans often call this album the band's debut album due to a change in direction leading to the "Summoning-sound" of [[Tolkien metal]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|articleurl=https://napalmrecords.com/english/minas-morgul-cd.html|articlename=Summoning - Minas Morgul|author=Napalm Records|accessed=25 July 2024}}</ref> The cover artwork is taken from the Roger Taylor novel ''The Call of the Sword''.<ref name=":0" />
