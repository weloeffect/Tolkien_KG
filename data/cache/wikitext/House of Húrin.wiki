The '''House of Húrin''', also known as the '''Hurinionath''',<ref name="Elendil">{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> were the descendants of [[Húrin of Emyn Arnen]], the [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward]] to King [[Minardil]] of [[Gondor]].  

This ancient family of the [[Faithful]] used (beside the [[Common Speech]]) the [[Gondor Sindarin|Sindarin tongue after the fashion of Gondor]]. Their official names (after [[Mardil |Mardil Voronwë]]) were in that tongue and drawn mostly from the ancient legends of the [[Elder Days]].<ref name="Elendil"/>

==History==
Húrin and his House were noted as being of high [[Númenóreans|Númenórean]] blood,<ref name="Stewards">{{App|Stewards}}</ref> for they were ultimately of [[House of Anárion|royal origin]] (they had some share in the actual blood of Elendil and Anarion), and had kept their blood more pure than most other families in the later ages.<ref name="Elendil"/> Húrin himself was of ultimately royal descent and a kinsman to his King, Minardil.<ref>{{NM|P2v}}, p. 188</ref>

After Húrin's time it became traditional for the Steward to be chosen from among his descendants, and in the time of [[Vorondil]], who succeeded his father [[Pelendur]], the post became hereditary. For this, the House was also known as '''House of the Stewards'''.<ref name="Stewards"/> Vorondil's [[Great Horn|horn]] became a hereditary heirloom, carried by the heir to the House.  

After the loss of [[Gondor]]'s last King, [[Eärnur]], the Stewards of the House of Húrin [[Ruling Steward|took up the rule]] of the [[Gondor|South-kingdom]]. That was until after the [[War of the Ring]] when [[Faramir]], the heir of [[Denethor II]], became [[Prince of Ithilien]] and [[Lord of Emyn Arnen]] (the lands of the House's patriarch).<ref name="Stewards"/>

==Genealogy==
Showing the descendants of Húrin of Emyn Arnen:  First the hereditary Stewards of the Kings of Gondor, then the Ruling Stewards, and lastly the Princes of Ithilien (who again served as Stewards to the restored line of Kings).  All information in the tree is from Appendix A ("The Southern Line: Heirs of Anarion"<ref>{{App|South}}</ref> or "The Stewards"<ref name="Stewards"/>) or (mostly for dates of birth) ''The Peoples of Middle-earth'', "The Heirs of Elendil",<ref name="Elendil"/> unless otherwise specified.  The figures after the names are those of birth and death where recorded.  A dagger symbol, '†' signifies those who did not die of old age.  A name preceded by '*' indicates one of the Ruling Stewards; an ''italicized'' name  denotes a [[Prince of Ithilien]].  A dashed line indicates marriage or a line of descent with some members missing.
