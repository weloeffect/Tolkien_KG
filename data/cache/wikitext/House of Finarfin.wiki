The '''House of Finarfin''' were the descendants and followers of [[Finarfin]], third son of the [[King of the Noldor|Noldorin King]] [[Finwë]]. It was also sometimes referred to as the '''House of Finrod''' in [[Middle-earth]].

==History==
The House of Finarfin was a branch of the Noldorin royal house formed by [[Finarfin]], the third son of [[Finwe|King Finwë]] and his second wife [[Indis]] of the [[Vanyar]]. Finarfin alone of his siblings inherited the Vanyarin features of his mother, including golden hair, and many of his descendants shared this trait. The descendants of Finarfin were also notable for possessing the blood of all three Elven clans having inherited blood of the Noldor and Vanyar from Finarfin himself and Telerin blood from his wife [[Eärwen]].

During the [[Exile of the Noldor]], Finarfin initially led a host of his people in seeking to leave [[Valinor]]. However, Finarfin  ultimately repented after hearing the [[Doom of Mandos]] and turned back in horror at his brother [[Fëanor]]'s actions in leading the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë|kinslaying of Eärwen’s people]]. Thereafter, Finarfin was reckoned the King of the Noldor who remained in Valinor.

However, Finarfin’s children - while also horrified by Fëanor - continued on because of their friendship with the [[House of Fingolfin]] and because their hearts desired realms to rule and order as they pleased in Middle-earth. For this reason, the House of Finarfin was sometimes referred to as the House of Finrod because it was Finarfin’s eldest son [[Finrod]] who led it in Middle-earth.

In Middle-earth, the children of Finarfin, alone amongst the great lords of the Noldor, were permitted to enter the realm of [[Doriath]] in light of their kinship with King [[Elu Thingol]] through their mother.

During the late [[First Age]], Finrod constructed the realm of [[Nargothrond]] and reigned as king of that great city. After taking up the kingship of Nargothrond, Finrod appointed his nephew [[Orodreth]] as warden of his former seat on [[Tol Sirion]].  During this time, Finrod's younger brothers [[Angrod]] (father of Orodreth) and [[Aegnor]] held the highlands of [[Dorthonion]] against [[Angband]]. The youngest child of Finarfin, [[Galadriel]] - considered the greatest of elven women and greatest of the Noldor except perhaps for Fëanor - dwelt between Doriath and Nargothrond with her brother, but eventually wed the [[Sindarin]] prince [[Celeborn]] in [[Doriath]].

Angrod and Aegnor were both killed during the [[Dagor Bragollach]] and Orodreth was forced out of Tol Sirion by the forces of Morgoth and sought refuge with Finrod. Some years later, Finrod passed on the regency of Nargothrond to Orodoreth in order to fulfil his oath to the [[House of Beor]]. After Finrod’s death, Orodreth became King of Nargothrond, but was killed a few short years later during the [[fall of Nargothrond]] along with his daughter [[Finduilas]]. However, his son [[Gil-galad]] survived and became the ward of [[Cirdan]] at the [[Falas]]. After the death of [[Turgon]] during the [[fall of Gondolin]], the [[High King of the Noldor|High Kingship of the Noldor]] passed from the [[House of Fingolfin]] to [[Gil-galad]] of the House of Finarfin as the senior male line descendant of Finwë still living in Middle-earth. During the [[War of Wrath]], King Finarfin led the Noldor as part of the Valar's army against the Dark Lord [[Morgoth]], but returned to Valinor at war’s end.

After [[Morgoth]]'s overthrow, Gil-galad led his people out of [[Beleriand]] and set up a realm in [[Lindon]] where he reigned longer than any previous king of the Noldor in Middle-earth. During the [[Second Age]], the House of Finarfin continued through the birth of Galadriel's daughter [[Celebrian]]. 

After the forging of the [[Rings of Power]], Gil-galad was gifted [[Vilya]] and [[Galadriel]] was gifted [[Nenya]] because they were considered the mightiest of the Eldar and best placed to protect the rings from [[Sauron]]. While Gil-galad passed Vilya on to [[Elrond]] before his death at the end of the [[War of the Last Alliance]], Galadriel continued to wield Nenya through the [[Third Age]] as the ruling Lady of Lothlorien. During this Age, the line of Finarfin continued with the births of [[Elrohir]], [[Elladan]] and [[Arwen]] to Celebrian. At the same time, the House of Finarfin’s followers appeared be among the wandering companies of Eldar tarrying in Middle-earth given that [[Gildor Inglorion]] claimed to be of the House of Finrod.

Regardless, the House of Finarfin appeared to finally pass back to Valinor at the beginning of the Fourth Age when Galadriel sailed west. However, with Arwen’s choice to become mortal the blood of the House of Finarfin continued in Middle-earth through her mortal descendants.

==Etymology==
Finarfin did not come to Middle-earth, but his children were called collectively by the [[Sindar]] as "the children of Finarfin", in [[Sindarin]] '''''Nost Finarfin''''' ("the house/family of Finarfin").<ref>{{PM|XINotes}}, p. 360, note 31</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In earlier versions, ''Finrod'' was the name for Finarfin, so in the [[Noldorin]] stage it was called '''''Nos Finrod''''' ("House of Finrod").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry NÔ</ref>
