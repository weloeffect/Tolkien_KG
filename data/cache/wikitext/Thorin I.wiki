'''Thorin I''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2035|n}} – {{TA|2289|n}}, died aged 254) was the [[Kings of Durin's Folk|King]] of [[Durin's Folk]] for 99 years, succeeding his father, [[Thráin I]], on his death in {{TA|2190}}. Thorin was the heir of [[Durin|Durin the Deathless]] being the great-grandson of [[Durin VI]].<ref name="AppA">{{App|A3}}</ref>

==History==
Thorin was born after his father Thráin had led the [[Dwarves of Moria]] away from [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] and had founded the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] in [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. Thorin himself became [[King under the Mountain]] in {{TA|2190}}. However, he heard that the majority of the remnants of [[Durin's Folk]] were now gathering in the [[Grey Mountains]]. In {{TA|2210}} he decided to leave the Lonely Mountain and reunited its people with [[Dwarves of the Grey Mountains|their brethren]] in the Grey Mountains, which were rich and largely unexplored.

Thorin I died in {{TA|2289|n}}, at the age of 254, and was succeeded by his son [[Glóin (King of Durin's Folk)|Glóin]]. His sixth great-grandson, [[Thorin|Thorin II Oakenshield]], was the much famed leader of the [[Quest of Erebor]], which reclaimed the Lonely Mountain from the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Smaug]].<ref name="AppA"/><ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Thorin's name is one from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. It means "Bold".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>
