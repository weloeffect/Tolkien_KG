'''Eglantine''' is a type of wild [[Roses|rose]]. [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] found it growing in [[Ithilien]] as they journeyed through that land.<ref>{{TT|IV4}}</ref> [[Eglantine Banks]], [[Peregrin Took|Pippin Took]]'s mother, was named after it,<ref>{{App|Took}}</ref> so it probably grew in [[the Shire]] as well.

==Etymology==
The name is used for the sweetbriar. It derives from French referring to the "dog rose", ultimately from [[Latin]] ''aculeus'' "spine".
