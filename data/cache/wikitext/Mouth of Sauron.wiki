The '''Mouth of Sauron''' was the '''[[Lieutenant of the Tower of Barad-dûr]]''', a servant and emissary of [[Sauron]] at the end of the [[Third Age]]. He was a tall [[Men|man]] that was robed in black and wore a high helm.<ref name="Gate">{{RK|Gate}}, p. 888</ref>

==History==
===Origins===
The Mouth of Sauron was a [[Black Númenóreans|Black Númenórean]] who "entered the service of the [[Barad-dûr|Dark Tower]] when it first rose again".<ref group="note">It has been noted that this reference is difficult to interpret; according to [[Appendix B]] the Dark Tower arose first some time after {{SA|3320}} and again in {{TA|2951}}. If the Mouth lived in the Second Age, he would be one of the [[King's Men]] of [[Númenor]], and probably prolonged his life with sorcery (cf. {{HM|Guide}}, p. 274); in the second interpretation he would serve Sauron only for 68 years, and this would make him a Black Númenórean of [[Umbar]] or [[Harad]]. The second interpretation is more feasible (and supported by [[Michael Martinez]]) but both have been considered.</ref> He had forgotten his original name, which is not remembered in any tale.<ref name="Gate" />

The Mouth of Sauron learned great sorcery and knew many of the Dark Lord's plans as a servant of Sauron. Being more cruel than an [[Orcs|Orc]] and cunning, he rose in power and favour.<ref name="Gate" />

===Late Third Age===
It is not known if the messenger who came from Mordor to King [[Dáin Ironfoot]] on a horse during the night in {{TA|3017}} and asked about the whereabouts of a [[Hobbit]] and for the return of a little ring that was stolen by this Hobbit was the Mouth of Sauron.<ref>{{FR|Council}}, p. 240</ref>

The Mouth of Sauron briefly appeared on a huge and hideous black [[horse]] or horse-like creature when he haggled with the army of the west in front of the [[Black Gate|Morannon]], trying to convince [[Aragorn]] and [[Gandalf]] to give up and let Sauron win the battle for [[Middle-earth]]. Though he came before Aragorn and his men as an ambassador, he used quite insolent speech when he dealt with them. He tried to intimidate the army into surrendering by showing them the [[Mithril-coat]] of [[Frodo Baggins]] to make them think that the [[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]] had been captured. Among the demands of Sauron he presented was the restoration of [[Isengard]], from which he believed he would rule over the lands west of the [[Anduin]] under Sauron. When Gandalf turned down his proposal, the Mouth of Sauron set all the armies of [[Barad-dûr]] upon them.<ref name="Gate2"/>

The Mouth's fate is nowhere recorded, but it is probable he died in the assault before the Morannon.<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 274</ref> If he had survived, it is likely that he would have been one of the leaders in the retreat of Sauron's evil servants after the fall of Barad-dûr.

==Other names==
The name "the Mouth of Sauron" poses a possible inconsistency in the narrative. Aragorn mentions that Sauron did not allow the name Sauron (which means "Abhorred" in [[Quenya]]) to be written or spoken.<ref>{{TT|Departure}}, p. 416</ref> Therefore it would be strange for a servant of Sauron to have a title that includes the name "Sauron". However, it is possible that the Mouth of Sauron did not use this title in the presence of Sauron and only used it when he was speaking to someone who was not a servant of Sauron.

In a [[Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings|Guide to the Names in ''The Lord of the Rings'']], Tolkien refers to the Mouth of Sauron as the '''Lieutenant of Barad-dûr''' in a note about the [[Witch-king]].<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', p. 20</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In a manuscript of an outline of Book V, the name of Sauron's messenger at Dagorlad is '''''Mordu'''''.<ref>{{WR|3|III}}, p. 256; [[Christopher Tolkien]] notes that the last two letters of the name might be read as ''du'', p. 267, note 32</ref> Following Mark Fisher's suggestion,<ref>{{webcite|author=Mark Fisher|articleurl=http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/m/mouthofsauron.html|articlename=Mouth of Sauron|dated=|website=EoA|accessed=14 December 2013}}</ref> [[Paul Strack]] explains that ''Mordu'' is a [[Noldorin]] name, probably meaning "Black Night", from ''[[morn]]'' ("black") + ''[[dû]]'' ("night").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-2485707341.html|articlename=N. ''Mordu'' m.|website=Eldamo|accessed=23 September 2022}}</ref>

In an earlier draft of the chapter "The Black Gate Opens", the Mouth was described as a living man, that was captured as a youth and in a later draft as the son of a house of wise and noble men in Gondor who desired evil knowledge and entered the service of the Dark Tower.<ref>{{WR|3|XIII}}, p. 431</ref>

'''1980: ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]'':'''
:The Mouth of Sauron briefly appears at the Black Gate. In this adaptation he was voiced by [[Don Messick]].

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:The Mouth of Sauron's role is expanded. He is portrayed as the person who tortures [[Gollum]] into telling Sauron of "Baggins" and "Shire", though he is not named until the credits.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Michael Bakewell]], [[Brian Sibley]] (eds.) [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]], "[[The Long Awaited Party]]"</ref> [[John Rye]] provided the voice of the Mouth of Sauron, symbolising the function of the Lieutenant of Barad-dûr.

'''1987 and 1990: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]] [[Lords of Middle-earth: Vol. II]] [[Gorgoroth (book)|Gorgoroth]]''''' 
The Mouth of Sauron is portrayed as a Black Númenórean Sorcerer called Ûrzahil of Umbar<ref name="Gorgoroth">{{ICE|3112}}, pp. 49-50</ref> who was in his prime when entered the service of Sauron in S.A. 3320 after the Downfall of Númenor and the return of Sauron to Mordor<ref name="Lords">{{ICE|8003}}, p. 34</ref>. Afterwards he used his sorcerous arts to slow his aging process to extend his own life.<ref name="Lords"/> He is 6 feet 7 inches tall and weighs 220 pounds. In battle he wears a tall black helm that is designed after the helms of the Númenórean kings. The helm resembles a diving fish and is trimmed with glittering scales and dark gems. Apertures in the fish's eyes allowing him to see his surroundings. His own mouth is behind the open mouth of the fish, his is face protected by nine stylized teeth while his neck is protected by the fanged lower jaw. The fact that he had forgotten his own name is explained by the fact that his memory retained the limits of a mortal man so that he forgot more than most people ever learn.<ref name="Gorgoroth"/>

The Mouth of Sauron is said to have fled to the southern reaches of Middle-earth to remain in hiding after the fall of Barad-dûr in S.A. 3441 and to have moved to Dol Guldur after T.A. 1000 when Sauron arose again there. He then returned to the city of Ostigurth in Mordor. After the fall of Minas Ithil he moved again to Dol Guldur and stayed there until T.A. 2941. He then fled from there with Sauron to Mordor and remained there until the end of the Third Age.<ref name="Gorgoroth"/> In his role as the Lieutenant of Barad-dûr he was in charge of all  operations of the fortress-city of Barad-dûr.<ref name="Lords"/>  Rumors suggest that the Mouth of Sauron has escaped after the Battle of the Morannon in T.A. 3019.<ref>{{ICE|3112}}, p. 101</ref>

'''1992: [[Der Herr der Ringe (1992 German radio series)|''Der Herr der Ringe'' (1992 German radio series)]]:'''
:The Mouth of Sauron is played by Peter Gawajda.

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'''''
:The Mouth of Sauron does not appear in the theatrical cut of the movie, but he does appear in the extended version, played by an unrecognizable [[Bruce Spence]]. His helmet, with the words "LAMMEN GORTHAUR" ([[Sindarin]] for "Voice of (Sauron) The Abominable") in [[Cirth]] written on it, covers his entire face except for his mouth, which is horribly diseased and disfigured by all the evil he has spoken, and disproportionately large, creating an unsettling effect. In fact, much of this spectacle is a result of CGI effects. Actually Jackson conceived this idea long after the footage had been shot and asked his special effects team to create the effect digitally.

:The extended DVD cast commentary mentions that Jackson considered different depictions of the character, such as having Kate Winslet (who starred in ''Heavenly Creatures'', another Jackson film) play the role, partially to emphasize the temptations Aragorn was facing.

:In the movie itself, Aragorn decapitates the Mouth of Sauron with [[Andúril|his sword]].  This sequence is often criticized by purist and outsider alike; through human history it was considered a crime of war to execute messengers or heralds. In the book, the Mouth actually specifically points out that as an ambassador he is protected by the laws of war, and Gandalf acknowledges this:

::''"...though Aragorn did not stir nor move hand to weapon, the other quailed and gave back as if menaced with a blow.  "I am a herald and an ambassador, and may not be assailed!" he cried.  "Where such laws hold," said Gandalf, "it is also the custom for ambassadors to use less insolence.  But no one has threatened you.  You have naught to fear from us..."'' -- Book V, Chapter 10, "The Black Gate Opens"

'''2003: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of the Mouth of Sauron is provided by Juraj Slezáček.

'''2013: ''[[Guardians of Middle-earth]]'':'''
:The Mouth of Sauron was added as a playable Guardian in a 2013 piece of DLC. 

'''2017: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The Mouth of Sauron is one of the Gúrzyul, mortal servants of [[Sauron]] whom through the Dark Arts he had made ageless during the [[Second Age]], although unlike [[wraiths]] they remain bound to their physical bodies and can be killed. First appearing at the [[Black Gate]] in a sequence near-identical to that in the book, the Mouth of Sauron survives the demise of his master and names himself Dulgabêth the Black Word, Sauron's Heir. The Mouth of Sauron is later killed by the player with the help of two Rangers.
