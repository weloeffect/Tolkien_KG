The '''war of the Dwarves and Dragons''' is a name given to the conflict that took place between [[Durin's Folk]] and the [[Dragons]] of the [[Grey Mountains]] that took place from {{TA|2570}} to around {{TA|2589|n}}. It brought about the death of King [[Dáin I]] and resulted in [[Durin's Folk]] returning to the [[Lonely Mountain]].<ref name="Durin"/>

==Background==
Following the defeat of [[Morgoth]] in the [[War of Wrath]], many Dragons were left in [[Middle-earth]].<ref>{{S|IV}}</ref> Between the [[Second Age|Second]] and the [[Third Age]], the [[Seven Rings]] helped the Dwarves increase their treasure troves and established their legendary [[Seven Hoards]], which however drew the mightiest of dragons and opponents; and over the years they plundered the works of the Dwarves and devoured some of the Rings.<ref>{{S|V}}</ref>

Many centuries before the beginning of the war, the [[Long-worm]] [[Scatha]] had plundered treasure from the [[Dwarves]] and kept it in his hoard. Scatha was slain by [[Fram]] of the [[Éothéod]], who kept the treasure for himself and refused to yield a penny of it to the Dwarves.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>

==History==
===Prelude===
Following the loss of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] to [[Durin's Bane|the Balrog]], in {{TA|1999}} [[Thráin I]] established the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] at [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]]. However, in {{TA|2210|n}} Thráin's son, [[Thorin I]], abandoned Erebor and removed his people to the [[Grey Mountains]] to join the rest of [[Durin's Folk]].<ref name="AppB"/> 

===Conflicts===
{{blockquote|But there were dragons in the wastes beyond; and after many years they became strong again and multiplied, and they made war on the Dwarves, and plundered their works.|{{App|Durin}}}}
The Dragons in the North eventually multiplied and became strong, and in {{TA|2570}}<ref name="AppB">{{App|B2}}</ref> they made war on [[Dwarves|Durin's Folk]], sacking and plundering their halls. The Dwarves held out for around twenty years, but finally in {{TA|2589|n}}<ref name="AppB"/> the Dragons attacked the halls of King [[Dáin I]]. King Dáin, and his second son [[Frór]], were killed by a great [[Cold-drake]] outside the doors to his halls.<ref name="Durin"/>

Following the death of their king, most of [[Durin's Folk]] abandoned the Grey Mountains. In {{TA|2590|n}},<ref name="AppB"/> King [[Thrór]] and his uncle [[Borin]] returned to Erebor with the [[Arkenstone]] to re-establish the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]]. However, Thrór's younger brother [[Grór]] led others to the [[Iron Hills]].<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref>

===Aftermath===
The [[Dwarves of the Iron Hills]] and the [[Dwarves of Erebor]] managed to prosper for the following couple of centuries.<ref name="Durin"/> However the threat of Dragons would return: in {{TA|2770}} the dragon [[Smaug]], hearing of the wealth of Erebor, flew south from the North "like a hurricane" and [[Sack of Erebor|sacked]] the wealthy [[Kingdom under the Mountain]].<ref>{{H|1}}</ref> Smaug dwelt in the Lonely Mountain until the [[Quest for Erebor]] in {{TA|2941|n}} which resulted in Smaug being killed by the [[Black Arrow]] shot by [[Bard]].<ref>{{H|Fire}}</ref> Although [[Thorin]] was killed in the subsequent [[Battle of Five Armies]], [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin]] of the [[Iron Hills]] (grandson of [[Grór]]) became [[Kings of Durin's Folk|King of Durin's Folk]] and [[King under the Mountain]].<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref>
