==Summary==
William Foster, a journalist for [[wikipedia:The Scotsman|''The Scotsman'']], had requested an [[Index:Interviews with J.R.R. Tolkien|interview]]. Tolkien prized ''The Scotsman'', but stated that he could not give interviews due to time constraints. New interviews would be available when his next book came out.
==Notes==
* An interview with Foster was published in ''The Scotsman'' of [[25 March]] [[1967]], so apparently the Professor found time.
