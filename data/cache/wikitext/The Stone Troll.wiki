<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Troll sat alone on his seat of stone,
And munched and mumbled a bare old bone;
For many a year he had gnawed it near,
For meat was hard to come by.
	Done by! Gum by!
In a cave in the hills he dwelt alone,
And meat was hard to come by.<ref>{{AB|Troll}}</ref>

== Background ==
The poem was first written around 1923 or 1924 with the Latin name '''''Pēro & Pōdex''''', before it was revised and renamed to '''''The Root of the Boot'''''. This version appeared in ''[[The History of The Hobbit]]''.

The ''The Root of the Boot'' version was set to the tune of ''The Fox Went Out'', and was first published as the 22nd song in ''[[Songs for the Philologists]]'' in [[1936]]. This version was reprinted in ''[[The Poetry of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'' and ''[[The Tolkien Papers]]'' ([[1967]]), and ''[[The Annotated Hobbit]]'' ([[1988]]). A revised form appeared in ''[[The Return of the Shadow]]'' in [[1988]].

Tolkien later revised the poem as ''The Stone Troll'' and included it in ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'' in 1962. [[Pauline Baynes]], who illustrated ''The Adventures of Tom Bombadil'', depicted Tom who kicked the troll with his ''boots'' as [[Tom Bombadil]]; although the name was most probably generic and there is no evidence that the author intended Tom to be Bombadil, as having an uncle and father would be absurd.

[[Robert Foster]] considers a possibility that Tom was somehow modelled after Bombadil, considering that Sam composed the poem soon after their meeting.<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 385</ref>
