The '''Dwarves of Erebor''' were those who dwelt in the halls of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]], beneath the [[Lonely Mountain]].  

==History==
===Kingdom===
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Heart of the Mountain.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Nasmith]] - Heart of the Mountain]]
[[Thráin I]] established the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] fleeing from Moria. During his time the [[Arkenstone]] was discovered, the most prized possession of the Kingdom. His son, [[Thorin I]], later became [[King under the Mountain]] but after seeing the wealth of the [[Dwarves of the Grey Mountains]], he abandoned Erebor.  

When the [[Cold-drakes]] invaded the Grey Mountains, they drove most of the Dwarves out. [[Thrór]], a descendant of Thorin I, took some of his people and flew the Grey Mountains for Erebor. His brother [[Grór]] continued east with a great following of Durin's folk to the [[Iron Hills]] while himself refounded the kingdom of Erebor in {{TA|2590}}.

===Second Kingdom===
The Dwarves gained the friendship of the [[Northmen]] along the [[Celduin]] and had much trade of goods, beautiful trinkets, and weapons with the town of [[Dale]]. The Dwarves of Erebor also had much traffic of ores with their kinsmen in the Iron Hills and the region had peace and prosperity for many years.

The Dwarves were properous, and made great wealth for themselves until they were dispossessed of their immense wealth by [[Smaug]] the Dragon, who flew south from the [[Grey Mountains|Ered Mithrin]] and [[Sack of Erebor|sacked]] their kingdom in {{TA|2770}}.  

The Dwarves reclaimed their inheritance many years later under the leadership of [[Thorin|Thorin II]].  But it was the descendants of [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin II Ironfoot]] that ruled there ever after.

===Third Kingdom===
After the restoration thanks to [[Thorin and Company]], the Dwarves became again rich and prosperous under Dáin's rule, as the Dwarves exceeded their ancestors in masonry and mining. Dale was rebuilt as a kingdom and they had close friendship with the [[Elves of Mirkwood]].<ref>{{FR|Meetings}}</ref>

[[Balin]] and other Dwarves set out to [[Balin's Colony|reclaim Moria]] in {{TA|2989}}. Dáin did not give his blessing and could not dissuade them.<ref name="Council">{{FR|Council}}</ref> It was only later learned that the colony was destroyed after five years.<ref>{{FR|Bridge}}</ref>

===War of the Ring===
In {{TA|3018}}, a messenger came from [[Mordor]], enquiring about "[[Bilbo Baggins|Baggins]]" from "[[the Shire|Shire]]", promising the last three [[Seven Rings|Dwarf-rings]] to Dáin. The King asked time to think and he sent [[Glóin]] and his son [[Gimli]] to [[Elrond]] for council, and to warn Bilbo.<ref name="Council"/>

The [[War of the Ring]] reached the North; King [[Brand]] fighting the [[Easterlings]] retreated from the River [[Carnen]] and was given aid by Dwarves in the [[Battle of Dale]].  After three days of fighting Dwarves and Men were driven back, and Brand was slain, followed by Dáin.<ref>{{UT|Erebor}}</ref> Several days later the Easterlings learned that the War was lost. When the new King [[Thorin Stonehelm|Thorin III Stonehelm]], son of Dáin, and Brand's [[Bard II]] saw this they came out of the mountain and routed their enemies.<ref name="Great">{{App|Great}}</ref>

Little is known of the reign of Thorin III, other than the Dwarves helped rebuild the cities of [[Minas Tirith]] and the fortress of [[Helm's Deep]]. Some of the Dwarves colonized the [[Glittering Caves]].

==Language and writing==
The Dwarves of Erebor spoke [[Khuzdul]] but used the [[Language of Dale]] for their public names.<ref>{{App|F1}}</ref>

Coming from Moria, the Dwarves brought with them the [[Angerthas Moria]], which however was modified further. For some reason some [[runes]] of Angerthas Moria were reverted back to their [[Elvish]] values in [[Angerthas]]. The resulting variation was known as [[Angerthas Erebor]].<ref>{{App|Cirth}}</ref>
