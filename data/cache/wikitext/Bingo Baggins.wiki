'''Bingo Baggins''' ({{SR|1264}}-{{SR|1360|n}}) was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of [[the Shire]].

==History==
Bingo was the youngest of the five children of [[Mungo Baggins]] and [[Laura Grubb]], and an uncle of [[Bilbo Baggins]]. He married [[Chica Chubb]], and their son [[Falco Chubb-Baggins]] was born in {{SR|1303}}.<ref>{{App|Baggins}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In early manuscripts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', the name ''Bingo'' was used of the character that would later be named ''[[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]''; first he was Bilbo's son, then "Bingo Bolger-Baggins" his adopted cousin.<ref>{{RS|1Iiii}}, pp. 28, 34 (note 1)</ref><ref name=rc/>

In earlier editions, [[Appendix C]] gives his death as {{SR|1360}}, but in some of the later editions the year is mistakenly given as {{SR|1363|n}}.<ref>Wayne G. Hammond and Christina Scull, [http://www.hammondandscull.com/addenda/rings.html Addenda and Corrigenda to the 50th anniversary edition of The Lord of the Rings (2004–5)].</ref>
==Inspiration==
It is believed that the original use of the name (for the character that would become ''Frodo'') was inspired by a family of toy koala bears of the Tolkien children, called "the Bingos".<ref name=rc>{{HM|RC}}, p. xix</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2003: [[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|''The Hobbit'' (2003 video game)]]:'''
:Five portraits are clustered on a wall in [[Bag End]]. One of them is Bingo, and one of Bilbo's lines when looking at the portraits is "Good old Uncle Bingo".
