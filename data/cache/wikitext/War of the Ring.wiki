{{Quote|So we come to it in the end, [...] the great battle of our time, in which many things shall pass away.|[[Théoden]] in ''[[The Return of the King]]'', "[[The Muster of Rohan]]"}}

The '''War of the Ring''' was the great conflict at the end of the [[Third Age]], named for [[the One Ring]] and the importance this had in the final outcome. The war was fought between [[Sauron]], the [[Dark Lord]] of [[Mordor]] who attempted to conquer [[Middle-earth]] as he nearly did in the [[Second Age]]; and the [[Free peoples]], being a loose alliance of [[Elves]], [[Dwarves]], [[Hobbits]], [[Ents]] and [[Men]] led by the [[Wise]]. [[Saruman]] participated both on Sauron's side and occasionally as a 'third power' based in [[Orthanc]].

Sauron held the military advantage throughout the war due to his overwhelming forces [[Orcs]], [[Trolls]], and [[Haradrim|Men of Harad]] and of the [[East]]. His main objective was to overthrow [[Gondor]], his neighbour and the strongest of his enemies. He had such forces at his command, though, that he was able to fight the war on many fronts, simultaneously attacking [[Dale]], [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] and the [[Elves of Mirkwood|Wood-elves]] in the far north, and [[Lothlórien]] from his secondary stronghold at [[Dol Guldur]].<ref name="AB" /> There can be no doubt that, had the Wise not achieved and maintained possession of the Ring, Sauron would ultimately have been victorious.

The policy of the Wise was based around the [[Quest of the Ring]]: a company of nine under the leadership of [[Gandalf]] travelled from [[Rivendell]] with the One Ring, with the hope of taking it to [[Orodruin]] in [[Mordor]] and there destroying it. As a consequence of much of Sauron's native power being within the ring, they realised that in unmaking it, they would also defeat its creator.<ref name="council">{{FR|Council}}</ref>

Having renounced the Wise, Saruman had become Sauron's two-faced servant. In an alliance with the [[Dunlendings]], and having [[Orcs]] at his command, he resolved to remove [[Rohan]] as a threat to his Dark Lord, but he also attempted to claim the Ring first when opportunities arose. Until late in the War, he held the advantage, defeating Rohan twice at the [[Battles of the Fords of Isen]].

==Background==
{{Seealso|Rings of Power|Third Age}}
Sauron, the [[Dark Lord]] of [[Middle-earth]] during the [[Dark Years]], had been defeated in the [[War of the Last Alliance]], but because of Isildur's refusal to destroy [[the One Ring]], he was not entirely vanquished.<ref name="council"/><ref name="Shadow">{{FR|Shadow}}</ref> He survived in spirit form, while the foundations of [[Barad-dûr]] also endured. Sauron's [[spirit]] wandered the wastelands of Middle-earth for over 1000 years, but eventually he rebuilt his power and became a threat once again. Around {{TA|1000}}, the [[Valar]] sent [[Maiar]] [[Wizards|emissaries]] to [[Middle-earth]] to help the [[Free peoples]] against the growing evil.<ref name="TA" />

Indeed, Orcs and other wicked things were multiplying and the [[Witch-king]] from his fortress in [[Angmar]] waged [[Angmar conflict|unending war]] against [[Arnor]]. [[Moria]] and [[Minas Ithil]] fell and were abandoned, among other battles, plagues, and catastrophes that ended the Kingdom of Arnor and the Royal line of [[Gondor]]. The evil entity known only as the [[Necromancer]] fled from [[Dol Guldur]] because of Gandalf, allowing for [[Watchful Peace|some centuries of calmness]].

[[File:John Howe - Alert the Folk.jpg|thumb|left|''Alert the Folk'' by [[John Howe]]]]

In the meantime, Sauron's One Ring was found by two of the [[Stoors]] in the [[Gladden River]]. The Hobbit who got it, under its influence, was corrupted as [[Gollum]] and eventually retreated into the [[Goblin-town]] under the [[Misty Mountains]]. By the end of the Age, Sauron attempted to gather back all the Rings to augment his power. He took [[Nine Rings|the Nine]], but of [[Seven Rings|the Seven]] he managed to reclaim only three, the last of them being the [[Ring of Thrór]]<ref>"the Nine [Sauron] has gathered to himself; the Seven also, or else they are destroyed." {{FR|Shadow}}</ref><ref>"You saw the Eye of him that holds the Seven and the Nine." {{FR|mirror}}</ref> but could not find the One.

[[Gandalf]] was concerned about the weak state of the North. [[Smaug]] the [[Dragons|Dragon]] had destroyed both the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] and the town of [[Dale]]. About [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] was a desolation that Sauron might use to regain the northern passes in the mountains and the old lands of [[Angmar]], not to mention the devastating effect of a living dragon in the Enemy's force. Gandalf, seeing no hope in [[Thorin]]'s plans of battle and war against Smaug, persuaded him that he should go secretly to Erebor to reclaim its treasure, and to take with him [[Bilbo Baggins]] of [[the Shire]].<ref>{{UT|Erebor}}</ref> Smaug was killed by [[Bard]], the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] were weakened, and most importantly, the kingdoms of Erebor and Dale were re-established.<ref>{{H|Return}}</ref> In a small incident along the way, [[the One Ring]] was lost by [[Gollum]] and wound up in Bilbo's hands.<ref>{{H|Riddles}}</ref>

Around the time the War began, it is said that [[Ithryn Luin|two Wizards]] had gained influence in the [[East]] and, thanks to their efforts, Sauron could not manage to gather as many people on his side.<ref>{{PM|Last}}</ref>

==History==
===Prelude ===
{{quote|The Dark Tower had been rebuilt, it was said. From there the power was spreading far and wide, and away far east and south there were wars and growing fear. Orcs were multiplying again in the mountains. Trolls were abroad, no longer dull-witted, but cunning and armed with dreadful weapons. And there were murmured hints of creatures more terrible than all these, but they had no name.|''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', "[[The Shadow of the Past]]"}}

During the [[Quest of Erebor]], the [[White Council]] attacked Dol Guldur and the Necromancer withdrew. However, Sauron returned to his old abode in [[Mordor]] to reconstruct [[Barad-dûr]] over its old foundations, and ten years after the fall of Smaug he sent three [[Nazgûl]] to reoccupy Dol Guldur. He declared himself openly in {{TA|2951}}. The [[White Council]] met for the last time in {{TA|2953}} to discuss the Rings of Power when Saruman reassured them that the One Ring had been lost forever in [[the Sea]]. After this, Saruman fortified Isengard, spied on Gandalf, learning thus his interest in the Shire, and started sending his agents around the Shire under the pretense of [[pipe-weed]] affairs.<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref>

Sauron began reassembling his forces for the final blow against the hated remnants of Númenor and the Eldar. Armies of [[Easterlings]] from [[Khand]] and beyond the [[Sea of Rhûn]] reinforced Mordor, joined by men from South [[Harad]]. Orcs, trolls, and other foul beasts were multiplying while Sauron's servants were searching the Anduin for the One Ring. Meanwhile, Saruman's use of a palantíri caught the Dark Lord's notice and he used the [[Ithil-stone]] to ensnare him, turning him into a useful, yet not wholly trustworthy, minion.<ref name="Pal" />

A year before the war, while Gollum was looking for his ring, he was taken to Mordor and interrogated by Sauron, who learned that the One Ring was in the possession of a "[[Baggins]]" in a place called "the Shire".<ref name="Shadow" /> However, Sauron was led into thinking that the Shire was on the banks of the Gladden River.<ref name="hunt">{{UT|10}}</ref> Gollum was then set free, but caught by [[Aragorn]], who placed him in the care of the [[Silvan Elves]] and held him in [[Mirkwood]].<ref name="TA" />

A messenger from Mordor visited King [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin II]] and asked for information on Bilbo and the Ring. Meanwhile, Gandalf reading the [[Scroll of Isildur]] in [[Minas Tirith]], also realized that Bilbo's Ring was the One Ring.<ref name="council">{{FR|Council}}</ref>

===First conflicts===
[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers - Boromir in Osgiliath.png|thumb|left|Boromir raising Gondor's flag in Osgiliath in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' (extended edition)]]
Sauron made an [[Sauron's attack on Osgiliath|attack]] on [[Osgiliath]] on [[20 June]] of {{TA|3018}}, which was the beginning of the War. Sauron saw it as an opportunity to test [[Denethor|Denethor II]]'s strength. [[Boromir]] and [[Faramir]] managed to defend and destroy the ancient Bridge in order to deny the enemy access to the western side of the river.<ref name="AB" /><ref name="hunt" />

About the same time the [[Elves]] of [[Mirkwood]] were attacked and during the fray, the captive [[Gollum]] escaped and would not be found by the Elves nor by Sauron's servants from Dol Guldur.<ref name="AB" /> The following months, Faramir led several [[Rangers of Ithilien|Ranger]] attacks deep into Mordor-occupied Ithilien, ambushing enemy armies moving to the Black Gate.

The presence of the Nazgûl in the [[Sauron's attack on Osgiliath|Battle of Osgiliath]] served to make them seem like a military asset against Gondor, concealing from the Wise their true mission, to hunt the Ring. After the assault, Sauron sent the Nine unclothed and invisible to search for the Ring under the leadership of the Witch-king. The Ringwraith [[Khamûl]] was unable to find "[[the Shire]]" in the vales of [[Anduin]]. The [[Witch-king]] searched north and west for Gollum or the Shire.<ref name="hunt" /> Gandalf heard from Radagast about the riders and went to [[Isengard]] for counsel, where Saruman showed his true colours and trapped him, for refusing to submit to Sauron or reveal the Ring's whereabouts.<ref name="council" />
 
Sauron's plans were halted when he received word of the prophecy in Gondor and the doings of his turncoat [[Saruman]], and concluded that the [[Wise]] did not yet have possession of the Ring yet, as he feared. [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] arrived at [[Isengard]] around [[18 September|September 18]], but Gandalf had escaped. Concealed behind the walls of Isengard, Saruman denied any knowledge and convinced the Witch-king that Gandalf alone knew where the Shire and the Ring were, and so the Nine passed into [[Rohan]] in search of him. A terrified [[Gríma|Wormtongue]] answered that Gandalf had passed through Rohan, where the Shire was, and even that Saruman had lied to them. The riders were divided into four pairs, and the Witch-King went with the swiftest to [[Minhiriath]]. Along the way, they captured several spies of Saruman and found charts and maps of the Shire. They sent along the spy to [[Bree]], warning them that they now belonged to Mordor, not Isengard.<ref name="hunt" />

On [[22 September]], they came to [[Sarn Ford]]. Although the [[Dúnedain]] [[Rangers of the North|Rangers]] were guarding the crossing, their chieftain [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]] was away and the Riders captured the ford, killing many of the Rangers. The Witch-king sent Khamûl and three Riders into the Shire while he went east with the others and then returned to watch the [[Greenway]].<ref name="AB">{{App|B3}}</ref> A Rider came to Hobbiton at nightfall, but failed to capture [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] who departed that same day carrying the Ring to the east.<ref name="hunt" /> The hunt continued to [[Buckland]] and Bree, aided by Sauron's spies, such as [[Bill Ferny]] and [[Harry Goatleaf]], but nonetheless, the Ring escaped them.<ref name=Strider>{{FR|Strider}}</ref>

[[File:Mysilvergreen - The Council of Elrond.jpg|thumb|left|''The Council of Elrond'' by [[:Category:Images by Mysilvergreen|Mysilvergreen]]]]

In October, Frodo came to [[Rivendell]] and during his arrival, the Black Riders were temporarily neutralized and were forced to return to Mordor to regroup. Some days later, the [[Council of Elrond]] was called, where it was decided that the only way to be free of Sauron and the Ring was to cast the Ring into the [[Cracks of Doom|Crack of Doom]] in [[Mount Doom]]. Frodo surprised everyone, including himself, by declaring that he would take the Ring.<ref name="council" /> The [[Fellowship of the Ring|team]] who would travel to Mordor departed Rivendell in December.<ref name="AB" />

===Saruman's part in the War===
Saruman was caught now as a known traitor to the Free Peoples and a mendacious vassal of Sauron. To escape this precarious position he implemented a strategy of controlling the King of Rohan for his lord's ends,<ref>{{TT|King}}</ref> but also doubled his efforts in the search for the Ring: sending spies to waylay Frodo Baggins on his flight from the Shire, and dispatching raiding parties on likely routes a [[Fellowship of the Ring|company of travellers]] might take the Ring to Gondor.<ref=Strider/> During the fall of the first year of the War, some [[Ruffians]] were sent to the Shire to gain control of the region, collecting the crops and suppressing any dissent to his expanding influence.<ref name="Scouring"/>
[[File: The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers - First Battle of the Fords of Isen.jpg|thumb|The aftermath at Isen as seen in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'']]
He then endeavoured to kill [[Théoden]] King's [[Théodred|son]] and [[Éomer|nephew]] and have full control of him. On [[25 February]], {{TA|3019}}, he sent his forces to attack [[Rohan]]'s army (commanded by [[Théodred]] and [[Grimbold]]) at the [[Isen]]. [[Dunlendings]], [[wolf-riders]] and [[Uruk-hai|Uruks]] clashed against the [[Rohirrim]] in the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]] with orders to slay Prince Théodred at any cost. [[Erkenbrand]] took command of the western defences of Rohan. He sent a messenger to [[Edoras]] to inform the King of the ill news and ask for reinforcements, but [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]] delayed the message. [[Elfhelm]] joined [[Grimbold of Grimslade]] and were left in charge of the Fords when Erkenbrand tried to send stragglers to [[Helm's Deep]]. Saruman was successful in slaying the Prince.<ref name="Isen">{{UT|Isen}}</ref>

The [[26 February|next day]], while the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Company of the Ring]] was in the [[Emyn Muil]] thinking whether to take the Ring to Minas Tirith or go directly to Mordor, Orcs from Isengard attempted to capture the Ring-bearer; they instead took Merry and Pippin as prisoners.<ref>{{FR|Breaking}}</ref> Éomer, hearing of the descent of the Orc-band, set out from the [[Eastfold]] against Théoden's orders and overtook them outside [[Fangorn Forest]], unknowingly setting the hobbits free.<ref name="AB" /><ref>{{TT|Riders}}</ref>

Having heard the news about Théodred's death, [[Erkenbrand]], who became the commander of Rohan's western armies, gathered the forces of Grimbold and Elfhelm to assault Isen once more in the [[Second Battle of the Fords of Isen]] ([[2 March]]). Though they had a force of about 2000 men and had constructed a shield wall to hold off the enemy, Saruman's forces overcame them and scattered the retreating Rohirrim across Rohan.<ref name="Isen" /><ref name="Deep">{{TT|Deep}}</ref>

Saruman's victory would not last. He did not know that on the very same day, Gandalf had healed Théoden from [[Gríma|Wormtongue]]'s influence. In the meantime, the [[Ents]] after ending their long [[Entmoot]], decided to go to [[Isengard]] and battle Saruman.<ref name="AB" />
[[File: Alan Lee - The Battle of the Hornburg.jpg|thumb|right|''The Battle of the Hornburg'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]
The next day ([[3 March]]), seeking to take the fight away from his people, Théoden brought around a thousand horsemen to the [[Fords of Isen]] along with any others in [[Edoras]]. Among this force were [[Éomer]], [[Aragorn]], [[Gimli]] and [[Legolas]]. On their way they found [[Ceorl]] who reported a defeat to the Fords; Théoden then redirected his troops to [[Helm's Deep]], which was commanded by [[Gamling]] in his lord Erkenbrand's absence. Against overwhelming odds, they fought the [[Battle of the Hornburg]] for two days against [[Uruk-hai]] and [[Dunlendings]], until the [[Deeping Wall]] was breached and all seemed lost. The surviving horsemen rode out to meet the hordes of Isengard.<ref name="Deep" />
[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Wrath of the Ents.jpg|thumb|left|''The Wrath of the Ents'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
At that moment, [[Gandalf]] returned, bringing with him Erkenbrand and many other soldiers from [[Westfold]]. They attacked the army from the rear, driving the attackers back into a forest of [[Huorns]]. While Saruman suffered this military defeat, Isengard was attacked by a march of [[Ents]] in the [[Battle of Isengard]] who drowned all the valley.<ref name="Flotsam">{{TT|Flotsam}}</ref>

After the defeat of Saruman, Pippin looked in the [[Orthanc-stone]] and saw the [[Eye of Sauron]]; Gandalf believed that seeing the Hobbit, Sauron would imagine that the [[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]] was caught by Saruman's orcs and that they could make good use of the delay caused by Dark Lord's confusion surrounding his minion's assumed betrayal.<ref name="Pal">{{TT|Palantir}}</ref> The protagonists of the War separated, anticipating Sauron's attack on Minas Tirith. Gandalf set out for Minas Tirith taking Pippin since he would not be safe. Théoden set out from the Hornburg for [[Harrowdale]].

Aragorn consulted the Stone of Orthanc and confronted Sauron subduing the stone’s power to his own will. In doing so, however, Aragorn has alerted Sauron to his existence as Isildur’s heir to the throne of Gondor. Gimli feared that Sauron would now release his forces sooner because of this revelation. Aragorn, however, hoped such a hasty move may weaken the Enemy’s attack.<ref>{{RK|V2}}</ref> They set out with the [[Grey Company]] to [[Dunharrow]] and took the [[Paths of the Dead]]. Théoden would come to Dunharrow.

===Sauron strikes===
On [[9 March]] fumes from Mordor veiled the [[Sun]] in an attempt by Sauron to disparage or misguide his enemies. The veil blacked out most of Gondor and Rohan who observed [[10 March|that day]] as the [[Dawnless Day]].<ref name="AB" />
[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Nazgûl.jpg|thumb|''The Nazgûl'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
Along with the Darkness, a host from [[Minas Morgul]] set forth toward Minas Tirith, as witnessed by Frodo, Sam, and Gollum who passed the [[Cross-roads]]. Later Orcs from the [[Morannon]] took [[Cair Andros]] and passed into [[Anórien]].<ref name="AB" /> [[Denethor|Denethor II]] called the [[Council of Gondor]] together on that day and it advised him to make no stroke of war against the enemy due to the threat from the south.<ref name="siege" />

The Rohirrim mustered their Riders and rode from Harrowdale,<ref>{{RK|Ride}}</ref> While preparing against Gondor, Sauron also began campaigns to conquer [[Rhovanion|Wilderland]], activating his armies stationed in [[Dol Guldur]] and eastern allies. This would bring the eastern half of Middle-earth entirely into his dominion. On [[11 March]], Orcs from Dol Guldur [[assaults on Lothlórien|attacked]] [[Lothlórien]] and [[Eastemnet|Eastern]] Rohan. [[12 March|The next day]] the invaders of Rohan were utterly defeated by Ents.<ref name="AB"/>

In Gondor, Most of the citizens were sent north and west; except those in the arts of healing and boys who refused to leave.<ref>{{RK|Pyre}}</ref> The same day, 3,000 men from [[Belfalas]], [[Dol Amroth]] and other places arrived to assist the garrison. But, it was less than a tenth of what was needed. Most that were needed were holding off the [[Corsairs of Umbar|Black Fleet]] of [[Umbar]].
[[File:Donato Giancola - Faramir at Osgiliath.jpg|thumb|left|''Faramir at Osgiliath'' by [[Donato Giancola]] ]]
[[Denethor|Denethor II]] sent Faramir to Osgiliath to [[Faramir's defence of Osgiliath|intercept the Morgul-host]]. The Witch-King led the assault upon the western side the next morning aided by boats built in secret, and swiftly overwhelmed the defenders. On [[13 March]], Faramir retreated to the [[Causeway Forts]]. Gandalf, after learning about the Witch-King, joined Faramir's forces to defend the [[Rammas Echor]]. However, Sauron's forces breached the walls with blasting stones, and wrecked the Forts. The defenders had to retreat across the Pelennor fields, with Faramir protecting the rear-guard. He was overtaken by cavalry from Harad, and poisoned by a dart, but was saved by a sortie led by [[Imrahil|Prince Imrahil]] and the Knights of [[Dol Amroth]].<ref name="siege" />

Denethor, upon seeing his wounded son, and the fields of Pelennor overran, lost his will to fight and gave no more thought to the defence of his city. The [[Siege of Gondor]] began.<ref name="siege" />

Meanwhile, invaders from [[Umbar]] and [[Harad]] who sought to capture [[Linhir]] and the fords of the River [[Gilrain]]. The men of [[Lamedon]] fought against them and the arrival of Aragorn with the Army of the Dead from [[Erech]] terrified both sides. As Aragorn pressed on to [[Pelargir]], [[Angbor]] mustered as many horsemen as he could, helped by the fast-spreading rumor of the return of the [[Heir of Isildur]]. Soon later the group reached Pelargir, drove the Corsairs away and captured their fleet.<ref name="Debate">{{RK|Debate}}</ref>

===Climax===
On [[15 March]], three simultaneous battles occurred.

In [[Rhovanion]], an army was sent from [[Dol Guldur]] to destroy the realm of [[Thranduil]] and a second assault against Lothlórien was made. After a long [[battle under the trees]], and great ruin of fire<ref name="AB" /> the Orc hosts were defeated on both fronts on the same day.

In Gondor, after the enemy passed Osgiliath, [[Pelennor Fields|Pelennor]] outside Minas Tirith was overrun, despite the armies that gathered from southern Gondor already in the days before the battle. The hosts of Mordor dug pits and set up siege weapons beyond the city's range as the Nazgul swooped near the city uttering cries of death, demoralizing the defenders. Then the weapons began launching stones at the city, many of which would burst into flame as they came crashing down. Then, the heads of all those who had been slain in battle were flung over the city. The whole first level was soon in flames.<ref name="siege">{{RK|Siege}}</ref>
[[File:Stephen Hickman - Siege of Minas Tirith.jpg|thumb|''Siege of Minas Tirith'' by [[Stephen Hickman]]]]
Near midnight the Witch-King launched his assault pushing many defenders to the higher levels, while others were slain trying to reach the walls. Many towers were also destroyed as they rolled forward.<ref name="siege" />

The Witch-King rode assisted by magic the battering ram [[Grond (battering ram)|Grond]] as it hit the [[Great Gate of Minas Tirith]]. As he entered the gate he was confronted by Gandalf who alone stood steadfast. Then a cock crowed and horn from the west sounded. The Witch-King left to deal with the Riders of Rohan at the Rammas Echor. The [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] began.<ref name="siege" />

[[File:Anke Eißmann - The Black Serpent founders.jpg|thumb|left|''The Black Serpent founders'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]
The combined army of Orcs, [[Haradrim]], [[Men of Rhûn]] and [[Men of Khand]], outnumbered the Rohirrim at least 10 to 1 but lost almost a third of their own forces. In the process, King Théoden was killed, and the Witch-King was destroyed by Théoden's niece, Lady [[Éowyn]] of Rohan. When all seemed lost, a fleet of enemy ships with black sails arrived at the landings to the south of the Pelennor in the Rammas, but it was actually manned by Aragorn. As his army drove north a great part of Mordor's forces were pinned between Aragorn and Éomer's cavalry and were "caught between the hammer and the anvil".<ref name="battle">{{RK|Battle}}</ref> 

[[File:Jan Pospisil - Dale units vs. Rhun.jpg|thumb|The Battle of Dale. Art by [[:Category:Images by Jan Pospíšil|Jan Pospíšil]]]]
Meanwhile in the North, [[Easterlings]] crossed the [[Carnen]], and King [[Brand]] was driven back to [[Dale]]. He gathered there with the [[Dwarves of Erebor]], and engaged in the [[Battle of Dale]] against the Orcs at the feet of the [[Lonely Mountain]] for three days until ([[17 March]]) he fell alongside King [[Dáin Ironfoot]]. Many Dwarves and Men took refuge in [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] and were besieged by the Easterlings.<ref name=AB/>

=== Sauron's defeat===
The [[16 March|next day]] it was understood that the army vanquished in the Battle of the Pelennor was only a fraction of Sauron's forces, and eventually Minas Tirith would not manage to withstand forever. [[Imrahil]] expressed concern for the defence of Gondor. Aragorn assured him that [[Angbor]] was marching with 4,000 men through [[Lossarnach]] to garrison Minas Tirith.<ref name="Debate" />

The [[Host of the West]] marched from Minas Tirith on [[18 March]] to confront Sauron.<ref name="gate">{{RK|Gate}}</ref> During that course, Lothlórien was attacked for a third and last time by Orcs ([[22 March]]). After much destruction, the Elves repulsed them once again.<ref name="AB" />

The Host of the West would meet Sauron's forces outside the gates of Mordor [[25 March|seven days later]], hoping to divert their attention away from the [[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]], who was nearing the end of his mission.<ref name="Debate" /><ref name="gate" />

[[File:Lída Holubová - Weak.jpg|thumb|left|''Weak'' by [[Lída Holubová]]]]
During the course of the [[Battle of the Morannon]] against [[Trolls]], Orcs and Men, the eight remaining Nazgûl attacked the army of the West.<ref name="gate" /> The [[Eagles]] of the [[Misty Mountains]], led by [[Gwaihir]], arrived and attacked the Ringwraiths.<ref name="gate" /><ref>{{RK|Cormallen}}</ref> When all hope seemed lost, Frodo failed his mission: he claimed the One Ring for himself, and Sauron was suddenly aware that Frodo had the Ring and was in the [[Cracks of Doom]]. Finally realizing that his enemies meant to destroy his Ring, Sauron immediately sent the Nazgûl to Mount Doom to intercept Frodo. However, Gollum wrenched the Ring from Frodo but fell accidentally into the fire, destroying the Ring. The hosts of Mordor, suddenly without direction, hesitated as Sauron's power was overthrown.<ref name="Doom" />

The Nazgûl were all destroyed as they flew over Mount Doom just as it underwent a gigantic eruption. [[Barad-dûr]], the [[Black Gate]], and the [[Towers of the Teeth]] collapsed to ruin. The Orcs and other creatures of Sauron were completely directionless with the Dark Lord's demise and were easily decimated by the army of the West and the Easterlings eventually threw down their weapons and surrendered.<ref name="Doom">{{RK|Doom}}</ref>

[[27 March|Two days later]], [[Bard II]] and [[Thorin Stonehelm|Thorin III]] Stonehelm, taking the reign from their respective fathers who fell in the assault, drove the enemy from Dale.<ref name="AB" />

[[File: Galadriel dol guldur bfmeII.JPG|thumb|right|The fall of Dol Guldur in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'']]
On [[28 March]] with [[Celeborn]] at their head, Elves crossed the Anduin in many boats and stormed Dol Guldur. In the [[Fall of Dol Guldur]], Galadriel threw down the walls of the fortress and laid bare its pits, so that the forest was cleansed. Thranduil cleared all the orcs and foul beings from North Mirkwood.<ref name="AB" />

===Scouring of the Shire===
The War did not end with the defeat of Sauron, for Saruman fled northward after the capture of Orthanc, and established himself in the Shire, bending the Hobbits to his will by threat of violence and the persuasive power of his voice. The return of Frodo Baggins and his companions from the coronation of King Elessar and the reunification of Gondor and Arnor, led to their arrest by the [[Shire-hobbits]] but they talked their way out.<ref>{{RK|Homeward}}</ref>

A small group of [[Ruffians]] was encountered, and Pippin declared the return of the King to them, and the message that emissaries were on their way. The group was routed, but managed to get a message to a bigger contingent in [[Waymeet]]. 20 Men marched from [[Hobbiton]] towards [[Bywater]], and 200 Bucklanders and [[Cotton Family|Cottons]] answered the call of Captain Merry's horn.<ref name="Scouring">{{RK|Scouring}}</ref>

The Men walked up [[Bywater Road]], to the point where [[Tolman Cotton Senior|Farmer Cotton]] was standing and found themselves heavily outnumbered. Their leader fell by arrows as he tried to strike at Merry. The rest surrendered. Pippin had set up a rebellion in [[Tookland]], and returned with one hundred Tooks when the larger group of Men from Waymeet arrived the following day and walked straight into a defensive pocket set up by Merry. Merry and Pippin charged from the eastern bank, and Merry killed the leader. Nearly 70 Men were killed and 12 were taken prisoner, while 19 Hobbits died and about 30 were wounded.<ref name="Scouring" />  

After their victory the Hobbits marched on to [[Bag End]], where they found [[Sharkey]]. It was not [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins|Lotho]] as had been thought, but rather [[Saruman]] who revealed that his servant [[Gríma]] killed Lotho. Gríma cut Saruman's throat in a rage for years of oppression and abuse but was himself shot by Hobbit archers. As the spirit of Saruman rose from its bodily form, it was blown away by a wind from the West; [[Manwë]] did not want him back.<ref name="Scouring" />

This battle is considered to mark the end of the War.<ref name="Chief">{{App|Chief}}</ref>

==Aftermath==
{{main|Fourth Age}}
[[File:Anke Eißmann - The Steward and the King.jpg|thumb|''The Steward and the King'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]
The consequences of the War were "apocalyptical" for the [[Westlands]] of [[Middle-earth]]. The ''status quo'' of many entities were restored, or even radically changed after centuries. Not only the millennia of Sauron's dominion were permanently brought to an end, but the relationships of peoples and races were redefined. It is also notable that during the War many personalities died (Denethor, Théoden, Brand, Dain), and brought their descendants into the aftermath. 

The major effect of the war, however, was that with the destruction of the One Ring, the [[Three Rings]] that had maintained the realms of the Elves in Middle-earth lost their power, and the Elves began to leave for the [[Undying Lands]]; significant Elves who marked the history of the Westlands for millennia, like Galadriel and Elrond departed, setting stage for the [[Dominion of Men]].<ref name="Chief" /> 
===Political ===
The downfall of Sauron brought the restoration of the long-awaited line of [[Kings of Gondor]], the restoration of [[Arnor]] and simultaneously the [[Reunited Kingdom|reunification]] of the two kingdoms; after centuries of nomadic wandering the [[Rangers of the North]] had again a kingdom and the Gondorians had a king. This King was Aragorn II a descendant both of [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]];<ref>{{RK|Steward}}</ref> furthermore, his marriage with [[Arwen]] reunited the lines of [[Elrond]] and [[Elros]] since the [[First Age]].

Other political repercussions were the strengthening of the relationships between the Kingdom and [[Rohan]], new relationships with the [[Ents]] (who now occupied [[Treegarth]], former [[Isengard]]), the [[Woses]] and the [[Hobbits]], now known as free peoples. On the [[Elven New Year]], Celeborn and Thranduil renamed Mirkwood as [[Eryn Lasgalen]] and  Celeborn took the southern part below [[East Bight]], naming it East Lórien. The wide forest in between was given to the [[Beornings]] and the [[Woodmen]].

===Calendrical impact===

All the above events made historians mark the years following the War as the end of the [[Third Age]]. 

Another calendric change was the [[New Reckoning]] which replaced the [[Stewards' Reckoning]], and the introduction of ''[[Cormarë]]'', a holiday on [[25 March]] that commemorated the fall of Sauron.<ref>{{App|D2}}</ref>
