'''Anar''' was one of the four Dwarves that accompanied [[Bilbo Baggins]] on his journeys after his birthday party.<ref>{{RS|Return}}</ref>

== History ==
In the early writings of the chapter ''[[A Long-expected Party]]'', Anar was given some dialogue and a bit more development.  However, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] later changed his mind, and did not disclose his name in the book nor gave him any dialogue.

== Etymology ==
Anar, or ''Anarr'', is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. His name most likely means "the Other" or "Starer".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>
