==History==
Gundolpho married [[Alfrida of the Yale]] and had three children: [[Gundahar Bolger|Gundahar]], [[Rudolph Bolger|Rudolph]] and [[Gundahad Bolger|Gundahad]].<ref>{{App|Bolger}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
''Gundolpho'' may be an Old German name, derived from the elements ''gunda'' "war" and ''olpho'' (classicized spelling "-olf") from "wolf".

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In drafts of the [[Appendix C]], Tolkien at one time had '''[[Cellar door|Celador Bolger]]''' within the Hobbit family trees,<ref>{{PM|Trees}}</ref> though he was ultimately replaced by Gundolpho Bolger.
