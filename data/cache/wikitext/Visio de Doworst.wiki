'''''Visio de Doworst''''' is a humorous poem that was written by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] in a medieval style reminiscent of ''[[Wikipedia:Piers Plowman|Piers Plowman]]''.<ref name=RG>{{CG|RG}}, p. 214</ref>

== First stanza ==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
In a summer season when sultry was the sun
   with lourdains and lubbers I lounged in a hall,
   and wood in his wits was each wight as meseemed:
   on his head was a hat as hard as a board,
   on his neck was there knotted a noose all of white
   with big bow and broad as a butterfly's wings.
   Most of that meiny had on mantles of stuff,
   shrouds short as shrift and shapeless as sacks
   that never covered their tails nor their touts either.
   The clamour of that company was the cackle of hens,
   till a bell rang brazenly —- that abated their noise!<ref name=collectedpoems>{{CP|139}}</ref></poem>

== Background ==
[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Doworst (manuscript).jpg|thumb|Tolkien's decorated manuscript.]]
The earliest surviving<ref name=collectedpoems/> manuscript, entitled both '''''Doworst''''' and '''''Visio Petri Aratoris de Doworst''''', was [[Letter to R.W. Chambers|given]] by Tolkien to [[R.W. Chambers]] as a [[Christmas]] gift<ref name=chambers>{{CG|2II}}, entry "Chambers, Raymond Wilson"</ref> on December 21<ref name=collectedpoems/> of [[1933]]. After the death of Chambers in [[1942]]<ref name=collectedpoems/>, the decorated manuscript containing the poem came into the possession of his secretary<ref name=collectedpoems/>, Winifred Husband. In [[1957]],<ref name=collectedpoems/> upon her retirement, Husband gave the manuscript to Arthur Brown, who later became the Professor of English at [[Wikipedia:Monash University|Monash University]] in Australia.<ref name=RG/>

While the manuscript was later lost upon Brown's death in [[1979]],<ref name=collectedpoems/> parts of the poem and its background were printed as "'''''Do Worst'''''" in "Fantasy that! — a Tolkien original", an article published in July of [[1975]] within the third issue of the ''[[Monash Review 3 (1975)|Monash Review]]''. The article describes the poem's background and contains a transcription of a letter from Tolkien to R.W. Chambers.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.tolkienguide.com/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=1805&forum=9&post_id=9618#forumpost9618|articlename=Doworst in 'Monash Review'|dated=|website=Guide|accessed=27 February 2012}}</ref>

In the summer of [[1978]], the first nineteen lines of the poem were printed as "'''''Doworst'''''" in an article on the third page of [[A Elbereth Gilthoniel! 1, no. 2|''A Elbereth Gilthoniel!'' 1, no. 2]], an issue of ''A Elbereth Gilthoniel!'', a newsletter published by The Fellowship of Middle Earth, a Tolkien fan-group at Monash University.<ref name=RG/><ref name=DA>[[Douglas A. Anderson]], "R. W. Chambers and ''The Hobbit''", in ''Tolkien Studies'', Vol. III, p. 144</ref><ref name=TB>"[http://www.tolkienbooks.net/php/details.php?reference=63510 A Elbereth Gilthoniel. 1978]" on tolkienbooks.net</ref><ref name=collector>"[http://www.tolkienguide.com/modules/wiwimod/index.php?page=AElbereth2-78 A Elbereth Gilthoniel! #2 (1978)]" on tolkienguide.com, July 7, 2011</ref> The exact month and day of the issue’s publication is not known, but it was likely published either between June and July,<ref name=DA/><ref name=TB/> or between May and August.<ref name=collector/><ref name=MU>"[http://libus.csd.mu.edu/record=b2244689 A elbereth gilthoniel!

Though the original manuscript was lost, Tolkien made another manuscript entitled '''''Incipit Visio Petri Aratoris de Doworst''''', which he gave to [[C.S. Lewis]]. After Lewis's death in [[1963]], the manuscript came into Walter Hooper's possession and ended up in the Bodleian Library after Hooper's death.<ref name=collectedpoems/>

In the summer of [[1953]],<ref name=RG/> Tolkien revised the poem, shortening it significantly, and gave a calligraphic<ref name=lea>{{CG|2II}}, entry "Lea, Kathleen Marguerite"</ref> copy of it to Kathleen Lea,<ref name=RG/> who sent him a letter of thanks and some [[Wikipedia:Sherry|sherry]]<ref name=lea/> on [[5 August]]. This version was entitled ''Visio de Doworst''.<ref name=collectedpoems/>
