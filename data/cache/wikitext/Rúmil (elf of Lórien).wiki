'''Rúmil''' was a [[Silvan Elves|Silvan Elf]] of [[Lothlórien]].

==History==
Rúmil was the brother of [[Haldir]] and [[Orophin]]. He was one of three wardens met by the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]] as they entered the [[Lothlórien|Golden Wood]].<ref name=lorien>{{FR|II6}}</ref>

That night, after a strong company of [[Orc]]s entered Lothlórien, in pursuit of the Fellowship, the brothers led the Orcs into the woods with feigned voices in preparation for an ambush by their folk. The following day, Rúmil and Haldir led the Fellowship onward and made a rope bridge to cross the [[Celebrant]]. Rúmil remained behind after the others crossed, returning to [[Nimrodel (river)|Nimrodel]] to keep watch.<ref name=lorien />

==Etymology==
"Rúmil" was a "learned" [[Quenya]]-name.<ref>{{PE|17}}</ref>{{rp|54}} As the name was identical in form to Quenya name of the [[Rúmil (elf of Tirion)|learned sage of Valinor]], and unknown to the Silvan or [[Sindar]] Elves, [[Tolkien]] decided it must have been given by [[Galadriel]] herself, but he questioned why such a name would be given to "one of the plain guards and soldiers" of the kingdom.<ref>{{PE|17}}</ref>{{rp|51}}
