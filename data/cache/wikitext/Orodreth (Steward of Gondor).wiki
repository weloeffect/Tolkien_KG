}}'''Orodreth''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2576|n}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 205</ref> – {{TA|2685|n}},<ref>{{App|South}}</ref> aged 109 years) was the sixteenth [[Ruling Steward]] of [[Gondor]].

Orodreth was the son of [[Belecthor I]]. As many of the Ruling Stewards were named after legendary figures of the [[First Age]]<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 203</ref> Orodreth was named after the [[Orodreth|Elf-lord]] of [[Nargothrond]].

Upon the death of his father in {{TA|2655}}, he succeeded him as the Ruling Steward. He ruled during an apparently peaceful and uneventful period for he Kingdom. He had one son, [[Ecthelion I|Ecthelion]], who succeeded him.

==Etymology==
