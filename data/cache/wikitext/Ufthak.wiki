'''Ufthak''' was an [[Orcs|Orc]] of the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]].

== History ==
Ufthak was captured and poisoned by [[Shelob]], and encased in her webbings. [[Shagrat]], his commander, saw him hanging there, but made no effort to free him as he was eager to leave the caves without making Shelob angry.<ref>{{TT|Choices}}</ref>

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
'''2003:''' '''''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)]]'''''
:Although not explicitly identified by name, a lone Orc can be found in the "Shelob's Lair" level, fighting for his life against Shelob's children in a small, web-filled chamber. While it might not truly be Ufthak himself, it may still be a homage to his fate. 
:He can be left to fend for himself, but he will start fighting the player if they choose to save him from his attackers.
