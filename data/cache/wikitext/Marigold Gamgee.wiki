'''Marigold Cotton (née Gamgee)''' was the youngest child of [[Gaffer Gamgee|Hamfast Gamgee]].

==History==
Like all Gamgees, Marigold was close to the [[Cotton Family]]. She married [[Tolman Cotton Junior|Young Tom Cotton]], the eldest son of [[Tolman Cotton Senior|Farmer Cotton]]. Marigold's brother, [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], married Tom's sister [[Rose Cotton|Rose]].<ref>{{App|Gamgee}}</ref>

Sam apparently had a close relationship with her, lamenting the prospect of not seeing her again during his time in [[Mordor]].<ref>{{RK|Doom}}</ref>

==Etymology==
"Marigold" (from ''Mary'' + ''gold'') refers to the ''[[wikipedia:Tagetes|Tagetes]]'' annual plants of the daisy family.

[[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] picked the name since it contains "gold" and referring to a golden flower, suggesting the [[Fallohides|Fallohide]] strain in Sam's family — which, increased by the favour of [[Galadriel]], became notable in his children.<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 760</ref>

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Marigold is not a regular NPC present in the game, but rather appears during a single quest available only when the game's annual Yule-festival is active. She appears in front of [[Bag-End]] to sign a petition to remove [[Lobelia Sackville-Baggins]] from her position as the Yule-planner.
