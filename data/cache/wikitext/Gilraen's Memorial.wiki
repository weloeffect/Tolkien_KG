==Synopsis==
In the early morning, as the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] prepares to depart [[Rivendell]], [[Aragorn]] clears away some greenery from the white stone monument dedicated to his mother, [[Gilraen]]. [[Elrond]] comes up behind  Aragorn, reminding him that his mother knew his ancestry would always put him at risk of danger, and left him in Rivendell for his own safety. Elrond also reminds Aragorn that, even if the elves can reforge the [[Narsil|sword of Elendil]], he is the only one who can wield it and reclaim the legacy of [[Númenor]], despite his reluctance to take up the role.
