'''Óin''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2238|n}} - {{TA|2488|n}}, died age 250) was the King of [[Durin's Folk]], succeeding his father [[Glóin (King of Durin's Folk)|Glóin]] upon his death in {{TA|2385|n}}, being the heir of [[Durin|Durin the Deathless]].<ref name="AppA">{{App|A3}}</ref>

==History==
During Óin's reign, the Longbeards continued to dwell in the [[Grey Mountains]]. 

Towards the very end of Óin's reign, in {{TA|2460}}, the [[Shadow]] returned to [[Dol Guldur]] in [[Mirkwood]] with increased strength; and in c. {{TA|2480}} [[Orcs]] began to spread again in the [[Misty Mountains]] in order to block all passes into [[Eriador]], whilst [[Sauron]]'s creatures took [[Moria]] as their own.

Óin died in {{TA|2488}}, having reigned for 103 years, and was succeeded by his son [[Náin II|Náin]].<ref name="AppA"/>

==Etymology==
''Oinn'' is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. His name means "Shy".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>
