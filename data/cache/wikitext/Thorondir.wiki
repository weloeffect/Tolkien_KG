}}'''Thorondir''' ([[Third Age]] 2782<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 206</ref> – 2882,<ref name="South">{{App|South}}</ref> aged 100 years) was the twenty-second [[Ruling Steward]] of [[Gondor]].

==History==
Thorondir was born when his father, [[Belecthor II]], was 30 years old.  Belecthor II lived until {{TA|2872}}<ref name="South"/> so when his son succeeded him Thorondir was already 90 years old.  Thorondir's stewardship was short; he ruled for only ten years. He was succeeded by his son, who ruled as [[Túrin II]].

==Etymology==
''Thorondir'' is probably a [[Sindarin]] name.<ref>{{App|Men}}, footnote after the third paragraph</ref> Its meaning is not glossed, but Paul Strack suggests that it means "Eagle-man" and that it is a combination of ''[[thoron]]'' ("eagle") and ''[[dîr]]'' ("man").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-4281337945.html|articlename=S.
