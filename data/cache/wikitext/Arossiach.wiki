'''Arossiach''', the '''Fords of Aros''', was the ford on the upper reaches of the River [[Aros]], where the long and perilous road through the valley of [[Nan Dungortheb]] crossed eastward into the lands of [[East Beleriand]].

==Geography==
The River [[Aros]] had its sources in two streams that flowed southward out of the hills of [[Dorthonion]]. Where those streams met, an ancient east-west road crossed the upper reaches of the river at a ford. The ford marked the boundary between two regions. To the east was [[Himlad]], and the other lands held by the sons of [[Fëanor]]. To the west was [[Dor Dínen]], and beyond it the perilous valley of [[Nan Dungortheb]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref>

==History==
The Fords of Aros seem to date back to the days before the beginning of the [[Years of the Sun]], when the roads north of [[Doriath]] were safe to travel. After the coming of [[Ungoliant]], and the raising of the [[Girdle of Melian]], the lands west of the Arossiach became a haunted and dangerous place, and in the late [[First Age]] the Fords were only used by the bravest or most desperate travellers.<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

[[Aredhel]], after leaving her brother [[Turgon]] and the city of [[Gondolin]], desired to see the sons of [[Fëanor]].  Denied entrance into [[Doriath]], she took the road north of the Hidden Kingdom and crossed the Aros at the Arossiach on her journey into Himlad.<ref>{{S|Maeglin}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Arossiach'' is a [[Sindarin]] name meaning "Fords of Aros", from ''[[Aros]]'' + ''[[iach]]'' ("ford").
