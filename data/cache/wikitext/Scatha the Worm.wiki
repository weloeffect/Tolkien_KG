== Poem excerpt ==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
:Some have great wings like the wind
:Some have fire and fierce wrath,
:Some have venom on their long teeth
:Some have hides like armour, tails
:like steel, tongues like spears, eyes
:piercing bright: some are great & golden
:Some are green; some are red as
:glowing iron. Not so was Scatha.<ref name=collectedpoems/></poem>

== Background ==
Around the year [[1954]], after having written the scene in Book VI of ''The Lord of the Rings'' where [[Éowyn]] gave the ancient [[Horn of the Mark]] to [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Holdwine]] of [[The Shire]], Tolkien wrote a short poem "in several styles" below the heading ''Scatha the Worm'', which was only a clear title of the second and third versions of the poem.<ref name=collectedpoems/>

It is possible that the detail that some dragons were green might be a reference to a story or poem<ref>{{CG|C}}, p. 5 (entry "1898-1899")</ref> that Tolkien tried to write about "a great green dragon" at the age of seven.<ref>{{L|163}}</ref><ref name="BII">{{B|II}}</ref>

The full poem was published for the first time as entry 177 in ''[[The Collected Poems of J.R.R. Tolkien]]''.<ref name=collectedpoems/>
