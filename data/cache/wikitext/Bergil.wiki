==History==
Bergil was born around {{TA|3009}} and was the eldest son of [[Beregond]] of [[Gondor]]. He had at least one younger brother, [[Borlas]]. 

A boy at the time of the [[War of the Ring]], he accompanied [[Peregrin Took|Pippin Took]] when he first arrived in the city of [[Minas Tirith]]. He led Pippin to the [[Great Gate of Minas Tirith]] to view the men from the various provinces of Gondor coming to [[Pelennor]] to reinforce the city against the impending [[Siege of Gondor|siege]].<ref>{{RK|MT}}, p. 769</ref>

Bergil served the [[Houses of Healing]] during the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].<ref>{{RK|Houses}}, p.859</ref> He found ''athelas'' for [[Aragorn]], which was used to heal [[Faramir]], [[Éowyn]], and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Meriadoc]].<ref>{{RK|Houses}}, p. 865</ref>

==Etymology==
''Bergil'' is clearly [[Sindarin]], but it is never glossed. It could be a combination of [[root]] [[BER]] ("valiant") + ''[[gil]]'' ("star").
