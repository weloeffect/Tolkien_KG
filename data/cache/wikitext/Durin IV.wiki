'''Durin IV''' was a King of [[Durin's folk]] who ruled the great [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] city of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], and the fourth king to have the name Durin. Like his father he bore a [[Ring of Thrór|Ring of Power]].<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref>

==History==
Like all Durins after [[Durin|Durin I]], he was given the name of the first of the [[Seven Fathers of the Dwarves]] because he greatly resembled him in both appearance and manner. Indeed it was believed among the Dwarves that he was the reincarnation of Durin I, though whether this is possible is unclear.<ref name="Durin"/>

==Etymology==
One account states that the name ''Durin ''was a word for "king" in the language of the [[Men of the North]] in the early [[Second Age]].<ref name=relations>{{PM|Relations}}</ref> 

Another account states that ''Durinn'' is one of the Dwarfs in the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. The name means "Sleepy".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>
