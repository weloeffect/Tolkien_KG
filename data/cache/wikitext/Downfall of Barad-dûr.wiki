The '''Downfall of Barad-dûr''' refers to the destruction of [[Barad-dûr]] as a result [[the One Ring]] being unmade.

==History==
[[Sauron]] began construction of Barad-dûr around {{SA|1000}}. Around {{SA|1600|n}}, he secretly forged the One Ring in the fires of [[Mount Doom]] and completed his fortress after 600 years of construction with the power of the Ring.<ref name="SA">{{App|B1}}</ref> The One Ring was said to be the foundation of Barad-dûr, this great tower of Sauron could only stand whilst the power of the One Ring endured. When [[Isildur]] cut the One Ring off Sauron's hand in the [[Battle of Dagorlad]] the tower was levelled, but with Isildur's refusal to destroy the ring, the foundations remained unbroken.<ref>{{FR|Council}}, p. 244</ref> 

Sauron rebuilt Barad-dûr in {{TA|2951}} after being driven out of [[Dol Guldur]].<ref name="TA">{{App|B2}}</ref> On [[25 March]] {{TA|3019}}, the One Ring fell into the [[Cracks of Doom]] whilst in the clutches of the creature [[Gollum]]. Barad-dûr was utterly destroyed,<ref>{{RK|Doom}}, pp. 946-7</ref> the [[Black Gate]] and [[Towers of the Teeth]] falling with it.<ref>{{RK|Cormallen}}, p. 949</ref>
