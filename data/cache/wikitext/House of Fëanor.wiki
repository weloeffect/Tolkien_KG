The '''House of Fëanor''' were the cursed descendants and followers of [[Fëanor]], the eldest son of [[Finwë]] and his spouse [[Míriel]]. 

==History==
[[File:Angel Falto - Feanor & Sons.jpg|left|thumb|''Feanor & Sons'' by [[:Category:Images by Angel Falto|Angel Falto]]]]
Fëanor was one of the greatest, and certainly the most skilled,<ref>{{S|6}}</ref> of the [[Noldor]], but his burning anger at the loss of his [[Silmarils]] led him to commit acts that would greatly diminish the influence of his house among his people. As the heir of Finwë, his descendants (specifically [[Maedhros]], his eldest son) should have inherited the [[King of the Noldor|Kingship of the Noldor]], but because of Fëanor's rash acts, the lordship of the Noldor passed to his brothers: [[Finarfin]] in [[Aman]],<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref> and [[Fingolfin]] in [[Middle-earth]].<ref name=":0">{{S|Return}}</ref> For this reason, and for the loss of the Silmarils, the members of the House of Fëanor are referred to as the ''Dispossessed''.<ref name=":0" />

The history of the House was a woeful one, and most of its members met an early end. Fëanor and six of his seven sons perished before the end of the First Age. His second son [[Maglor]] survived beyond the [[War of Wrath]], wandering the shores of Middle-earth, but his fate is unknown.<ref>{{S|24}}</ref> The last of the House was Fëanor's grandson [[Celebrimbor]], the son of [[Curufin]],<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, Note 7, pp. 317-9</ref> who had a great part in the making of the [[Rings of Power]], and was tortured to death by [[Sauron]] during the [[Second Age]].<ref>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>

==Other names==
In the [[The Etymologies|''Etymologies'']], the [[Noldorin]] name of the House of Fëanor was '''''Nos Fëanor''''' (cf. ''[[nossë#Quenya|nosse]]'').<ref>{{VT|46a}}, p. 6</ref>

[[Christopher Tolkien]] used the term "'''[[Fëanorians]]'''" for the followers of Fëanor many times in his notes and comments along ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', probably just for practical reasons.<ref>{{HM|IX}}, pp. 158-159</ref> It is used like this by the [[fandom]]. 

In the fourth stanza of the final form of the ''[[Eärendillinwë]]'', Tolkien uses the word '''Fëanorians''', though it is unclear if the term refers to the followers of Fëanor or the [[Sons of Fëanor]].<ref>{{TI|V}}, pp. 102, 104</ref> Tolkien also uses the word '''Fëanorian''', when discussing linguistic matters of Old [[Sindarin]], to refer to the people of the House of Fëanor.<ref>{{PE|17}}, pg. 131</ref>
