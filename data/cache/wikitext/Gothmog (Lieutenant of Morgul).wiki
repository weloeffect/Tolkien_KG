'''Gothmog''' was the lieutenant of [[Minas Morgul]].<ref name=Battle>{{RK|Battle}}, p. 846</ref> It is possible that Gothmog was second-in-command to the [[Witch-king|Lord of the Nazgûl]] or less likely second-in-command of the troops of Minas Morgul.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 565</ref> Gothmog was also the name of the [[Gothmog (balrog)|Lord of Balrogs]] from the [[First Age]].<ref>{{WR|3|IX}}, note 9, p. 372</ref><ref>{{S|Index}}, entry ''Gothmog''</ref>

==History==
On [[March 15]] {{TA|3019}}<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019, March 15, p. 1094</ref> after the Lord of the Nazgûl was slain by [[Éowyn]] during the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]],<ref>{{RK|Battle}}, p. 842</ref> Gothmog ordered reserves consisting of [[Easterlings]] with axes, [[Variags]] of [[Khand]], [[Haradrim|Southrons]] in scarlet and black men like [[half-trolls]] with white eyes and red tongues, which had been accumulated at the ruined city of [[Osgiliath]] to move into the [[Pelennor Fields]] to attack the cavalry of the [[Rohirrim]] and of [[Gondor]].<ref name=Battle/>

Gothmog's fate is never specified. It is possible that Gothmog perished along with almost all of the servants of Sauron that fought before the gates of [[Minas Tirith]]. It is also possible that Gothmog fled with the others out of the [[Rammas Echor]] and across the [[Anduin]].

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Gothmog.mp3|Ardamir}}
The name ''Gothmog'' is derived from the roots GOS-/GOTH- ("dread"), and MBAW- ("compel, force, subject, oppress") (found also in the title for Morgoth ''Bauglir'': the tyrant or oppressor).<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}</ref>{{rp|359, 372}}

==Origin==
Almost nothing is known about Gothmog. Tolkien scholars speculate that Gothmog might have been one of the following:
*A [[Men|Man]],<ref>{{webcite|author=Steuard Jensen|articleurl=http://tolkien.slimy.com/newsgroups/Gothmog.txt|articlename=Gothmog as a Human|website=tolkien.slimy.com}}</ref> in which case Gothmog was probably a [[Black Númenóreans|Black Númenórean]] like the [[Mouth of Sauron]]
*One of the [[Nazgûl]],<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 172</ref> although [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] never specifically mentions Gothmog among the Nazgûl.
*Gothmog could be anything from an [[Orcs|Orc]] or [[Uruk-hai|Uruk]], (despite possessing a Sindarin name) or a [[Boldog]], a fallen [[Maiar|Maia]] in Orc form.

'''1977: [[War of the Ring (1977 board game)|''War of the Ring'' (board game)]]:'''
:Gothmog is the second most powerful Nazgûl. He begins the game at Dol Guldur.

'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''
:Gothmog is a [[Half-trolls|half-troll]], a crossbreed of trolls and [[Variags]].<ref>{{ICE|3112}}</ref>

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:Gothmog is portrayed as an Orc-general with a misshapen face. He is played by [[Lawrence Makoare]] and voiced by [[Craig Parker]].<ref>{{rotkee}}, Director's Commentary</ref> [[Peter Jackson]] wanted to show a hideously deformed orc, one that would aptly convey the "ugliness" of [[Mordor]]. The upper left side of Gothmog's body is swollen and pock-marked from a disease of some sort, as described by the design department. His pale, yellow skin may also be a consequence of this illness. Gothmog's intelligence is far above that of the common orc and he, understandably, would be the perfect link between the Witch-King and the other planners of the siege of [[Minas Tirith]] (most likely men in Sauron's service) and the mindless mass of orc infantry on the front lines. While Gothmog likely did not have the intelligence to design the attack on the White City he certainly would have been able to ensure orders were carried out. Gothmog is clearly a brutal commander, but also an over-confident one. Peter Jackson comments that Gothmog feels powerful with Mordor's massive army behind him, but in reality is a crippled orc, as seen in his failed dismount from a [[Wargs|Warg]] in the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (extended edition)|Extended edition]]. Gothmog does, however, seem to be a capable warrior, though somewhat inhibited by his crippled left side.

:In the midst of the chaos, Gothmog is forced into hand-to-hand combat. He sees a pocket of particularly stiff resistance, primarily from Théoden and [[Éowyn]], and decides to fight Éowyn. She is a more skilled fighter than he, however, and soon injures him on his crippled left leg, rendering him essentially unable to walk and useless to Mordor's army as a whole. After Éowyn has killed the Witch-King, in an act of revenge, Gothmog attempts to kill her with a mace he finds nearby. He is, however, killed just in time by [[Aragorn]] and [[Gimli]]. As he is about to strike, Aragorn cuts off his armored right arm, but Gothmog persists and Gimli hits him in the abdomen with his axe. Aragorn then cuts through Gothmog's armor on the right side with his sword to finally bring the Orc down.

:In October 2021, news spread that [[Elijah Wood]] claimed on a podcast that one of the orc masks in the films "was designed to look like [[wikipedia:Harvey Weinstein|Harvey Weinstein]]".<ref>{{webcite|author=Ryan Parker|articleurl=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/lord-of-the-rings-elijah-wood-orc-harvey-weinstein-1235025070/|articlename=Elijah Wood Claims ‘Lord of the Rings’ Orc Was Designed to Resemble Harvey Weinstein|dated=4 October 2021|website=[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com www.hollywoodreporter.com]|accessed=8 October 2021}}</ref> While Wood did not explicitly refer to Gothmog as portrayed in the movie, Gothmog's orc mask was widely identified as the orc character in question.<ref>{{webcite|author=Chris Robertson|articleurl=http://news.sky.com/story/harvey-weinstein-was-used-as-inspiration-for-an-orc-in-lord-of-the-rings-elijah-wood-says-12427118|articlename=Harvey Weinstein was used as inspiration for an orc in Lord Of The Rings, Elijah Wood says|dated=6 October 2021|website=[http://news.sky.com/ news.sky.com]|accessed=8 October 2021}}</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=Gloria Oladipo|articleurl=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/oct/05/elijah-wood-lord-of-the-rings-orc-modeled-harvey-weinstein|articlename=Lord of the Rings orc was modeled after Harvey Weinstein, Elijah Wood reveals|dated=5 October 2021|website=[http://www.theguardian.com www.theguardian.com]|accessed=8 October 2021}}</ref><ref>{{webcite|author=Patrick Benjamin|articleurl=http://www.dazeddigital.com/film-tv/article/54408/1/elijah-wood-reveals-a-lord-of-the-rings-orc-was-based-on-harvey-weinstein|articlename=Elijah Wood reveals a Lord of the Rings orc was based on Harvey Weinstein|dated=6 October 2021|website=[http://www.dazeddigital.com www.dazeddigital.com]|accessed=8 October 2021}}</ref>

'''2015: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Gothmog plays a major role in the game as the chief antagonist of several Epic story-lines and is also combined with the character of [[Eärnur]]. In the game's version of events, in [[Minas Morgul]] Eärnur was transformed into a [[Wraiths|wraith]] named '''Mordirith''' in service of the [[Witch-king]], who in mockery of the [[Stewards of Gondor]] made Mordirith his own Steward at [[Carn Dûm]] in [[Angmar]]. Long absent from that evil bastion, Mordirith returns to Carn Dûm shortly before [[War of the Ring]], launching attacks against the Free Peoples of [[Eriador]]. Mordirith is defeated at the end of the game's original storyline, plunging the other servants of [[Sauron]] into a civil war over his position before he returns and his identity is revealed at the end of ''Volume I''. He is defeated again, but instead of being sent back to the North he is bestowed upon the name of '''Gothmog''' and is ordered to lead the Witch-King's armies against [[Gondor]].

:The player doesn't meet him again until [[Osgiliath]], shortly before the [[Siege of Minas Tirith]]. During the [[Battle of Pelennor Fields]] Gothmog personally kills the Ranger [[Halbarad]], but when his master is undone and can no longer bring him back from the [[Void]], he suddenly feels fear again and flees the battlefield before [[Aragorn]]. Gothmog barricades himself inside Minas Morgul, refusing even Sauron's muster to the Black Gate. Though he outlives the Dark Lord's demise, his other surviving servants blame Gothmog for it and combine their forces to assault of the City of the Dead. This gives the players and a group of [[Rangers of Ithilien]] the opportunity to sneak inside and challenge Gothmog, delivering a final defeat to him.

'''2023: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-earth]]'':'''
:Gothmog is portayed in the ''Gothmog, Morgul Lieutenant'' card as a human.
