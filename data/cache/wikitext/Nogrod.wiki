'''Nogrod''' was one of two great underground [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] [[Dwarf realms|cities]] in the [[Blue Mountains|Ered Luin]], the other being [[Belegost]], that prospered during the [[First Age]]. It was home to the [[Dwarves of Nogrod]].

==Geography==
Nogrod was delved in the eastern side of the north-central part and of the [[Blue Mountains]] southeast of [[Dolmed|Mount Dolmed]]<ref name=Sindar>{{S|Sindar}}</ref> where the Dwarf-road of [[Beleriand]] crossed into [[Eriador]],<ref name=MI>{{TI|MI}}, p. 301</ref><ref>{{S|Map}}</ref><ref>{{WJ|Maeglin}}, redrawn version of a photocopy of the northeast section of the Second Silmarillion map on which J.R.R. Tolkien added the location of Belegost, p. 331</ref> guarding one of the only passes over the Blue Mountains<ref>{{VT|48a}}, p. 24 ("But the Dwarves had built some great Mansions in those mountains [the Ered Luin] (commanding the only passes)")</ref> not far from lake [[Nenuial]].<ref name=Concerning>{{UT|Concerning}}, p. 235</ref>

==History==
The city was built sometime during the [[Years of the Trees]] when the western [[Fathers of the Dwarves]] awoke from beneath the [[Ered Luin]].<ref name="ReferenceA">{{VT|48a}}, p. 24 ("...which had certainly been founded long ago ... before the coming of the exiled Noldor, probably before the Eldar of the Great Journey ever reached Beleriand")</ref>

Nogrod traded throughout Beleriand and the Dwarves were employed for delvings and crafts, most famously the [[Nauglamir]] for King [[Thingol]].<ref>{{S|Doriath}}</ref> [[Eöl]] the Dark Elf often went there, as did his son [[Maeglin]].<ref name=Sindar/> 

At the end of the First Age, Nogrod was ruined in the [[War of Wrath]],<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref> and around the [[Second Age 40|fortieth year]] of the [[Second Age]] the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains began to migrate to [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]], abandoning Nogrod and [[Belegost]].<ref>{{App|SA}}</ref>  However, there always remained some Dwarves on the eastern side of the Blue Mountains in days afterwards.<ref name=Concerning/>

==Etymology==
''Nogrod'' is a [[Sindarin]] name; it was originally known as '''''Novrod''''' which means "hollow delving" aka '''''Hollowbold''''', like its original [[Khuzdul]] name '''''Tumunzahar'''''<ref name=Sindar/> and the [[Quenya]] translation '''''Návarot'''''.<ref>{{WJ|AB}}, p. 389</ref>

''Novrod'' was altered to ''Naug''rod under the influence of the similar-sounding word ''[[naug]]'' ("dwarf").<ref name=el/> Therefore while the name '''Hollowbold''' is provided as the translation of ''Nogrod''<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref> it is not a literal translation; the new name means rather "Dwarf dwelling".<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Nogrod"</ref>

The second element of ''Novrod/Nogrod'' is Sindarin ''groth/grod'' ("delving, underground dwelling").<ref name=el>{{S|Elements}}</ref> 

In the [[Noldorin]] phase of the language, it contains the element ''[[naug]]'' ("dwarf"). The second element ''-rod'' is not explained, but a note by [[Christopher Tolkien]] points to entry [[ROD]], an etymological [[root]] meaning "cave". Relevant Noldorin words include ''rhond'' ("cave") and ''rhaud'' ("hollow, cavernous").<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entries "NAUK", "ROD"</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the earliest version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', Nogrod was located "a very long journey southward beyond the wide forest on the borders of those great heaths nigh Umboth-muilin the Pools of Twilight, on the marches of [[Tasarinan]]".<ref>{{LT2|IV}}, p. 225</ref>

In the ''[[The Lay of the Children of Húrin]]'' the Dwarves of Nogrod were traders, bringing wine of [[Dor-Winion]] "that is bruised from the berries of the burning South" by long ways to the lands of the North, including Doriath.<ref>{{LB|1f}}</ref>

On the Eastward Extension of [[the First 'Silmarillion' Map]], the [[Dwarf-road of Beleriand|Dwarf-road]] crosses the Blue Mountains below Mount Dolmed, then turns to the south and continues until the edge of the map with the direction "Southward in East feet of Blue Mountans are Belegost and Nogrod".<ref>{{SM|Preface}}, p. v bottom-right corner</ref><ref>{{SM|East}}, entry, ''Dwarf-road'' and ''Sarn Athra'', p. 285</ref><ref>{{WJ|Dwarves}}, §124</ref> In the second version of [[The Earliest Annals of Beleriand|the Earliest ''Annals of Beleriand'']]<ref>{{SM|7II}}, "the Dwarves dwelt in great mines and cities in the East of Eredlindon and far south of Beleriand, the chief of these were Nogrod and Belegost", p. 399</ref> and in [[The Later Annals of Beleriand|the Later ''Annals of Beleriand'']],<ref>{{LR|AB}}, entry YS 104 [154], "the Dwarves had great mines and cities in the east of Eredlindon, far south of Beleriand, and the chief of these cities were Nogrod and Belegost" and "the Dwarves trafficked into Beleriand; and they made a great road, which came north, east of the mountains, and thence it passed under the shoulders of Mount Dolm", p. 143</ref> Nogrod was in the east of the Blue Mountains and far south of Beleriand.

The position of Belegost was later moved by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] to the north of Mount Dolmed on a photocopy of [[the Second 'Silmarillion' Map]].<ref name=MI/> This corresponds with its position in the ''[[Quenta Silmarillion (Lost Road)|Quenta Silmarillion]]'' from [[1937]],<ref>{{LR|Quenta}}, 10. Of Men and Dwarfs, §122, "the Dwarfs [...] for the chief dwellings of that race were then in the mountains east of Thargelion, the land of Cranthir, and were digged deep in the eastern slopes of Eredlindon", p. 299</ref> in the revised version of [[The Later Quenta Silmarillion|the Later ''Quenta Silmarillion'']],<ref>{{WJ|Two}}, Of the Naugrim and the Edain, Concerning the Dwarves, §7, "whereas Belegost and Nogrod were upon the east side of Eredlindon and nigh to the lands of the Eldar"</ref> and in the ''[[Grey Annals]]''.<ref>{{WJ|One}}, entry for the year 1250, §19, "on the east-side of Eryd Luin, north and south of Mount Dolmed, in those places which the Eldar named Belegost and Nogrod"</ref>

Although the locations of Nogrod and Mount Dolmed are not indicated on the ''[[General Map of Middle-earth]]'' and on the map of ''[[The West of Middle-earth at the End of the Third Age]]'', Mount Dolmed can be identified as the westernmost mountain in the middle of the part of the [[Blue Mountains]], which is north of the [[Gulf of Lune]] by using the position of Mount Dolmed relative to the positions of the Hill of Himring and the highland of [[Taur-nu-Fuin]] on the ''[[Map of Beleriand and the Lands to the North]]'' and determining the position of Nogrod and Mount Dolmed relative to the positions of their respective remains after the War of Wrath, the island of [[Himring|Himling]] and the island of [[Tol Fuin]],<ref>{{UT|IMap}}, second paragraph</ref> on [[Christopher Tolkien]]'s original map of The West of Middle-earth at the End of the Third Age.<ref>[[Ronald Kyrmse]], "The Location of Mount Dolmed on Maps from the First and Third Ages", July 2020; [https://hcommons.org/deposits/objects/hc:32884/datastreams/CONTENT/content], accessed 21 August 2022</ref><ref>[[Ronald Kyrmse]], "The Geographical Relation between Beleriand and Eriador" in ''[[Mallorn (journal)|Mallorn]]'' no. [[Mallorn 26|26]], September 1989, pp. 25–7</ref><ref>[[Didier Willis]], Bulletin de géographie ''Hiswelóce'', special issue no. 1, Winter 1994 (French); [http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/site3/articles.php?lng=en&pg=41 Mystères géographiques n°1 : Mont Dolmed & cités naines] (c. 2000), [http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/site3/index.php?lng=fr Hiwelokë], accessed March 23rd, 2011 (French); revised and augmented in "Du Beleriand aux confins de Rhûn" in ''[[Tolkien, le façonnement d'un monde]]'', vol. 2, 2014, pp. 197-230</ref> This location is on a similar latitude as lake Nenuial.
