==Quotes==
{{Quote|I wasn't into Tolkien at school really. But the story is timeless, the themes that it touches on are contained in cultures all around the world. The innocent on a quest, the pretender, an inanimate object that holds evil - it's really strange that these themes are there in so many different countries' folklore.|Billy Boyd, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2002/12/14/billy_boyd_two_towers_interview.shtml BBC]}}

{{Quote|I think his part in the story – as well as reminding people that the hobbits are basically fun at the core and are good, good people – his story is about maturing, and a young man in war and how he deals with those horrors. In watching this kind of naïve, innocent little creature who then is kind of scarred by these wars that go around and how that affects him.|Billy Boyd on his character, [http://movies.ign.com/articles/393/393444p1.html IGN.com]}}
