==History==
Egalmoth was probably named after the [[Noldor]]in [[Elves|Elf]] of the [[First Age]].

He succeeded his cousin [[Ecthelion I]] upon his death in {{TA|2698}}. Egalmoth was the grandson of [[Morwen (daughter of Belecthor)|Morwen]], daughter of [[Belecthor I]].  During his rule there was renewed war with the [[Orcs]].<ref name="Elendil"/><ref group=note>It is not clear if the "Orc-wars" concerned the [[Uruks]] [[Orcs of Mordor|of Mordor]], and/or they were related to the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains|Orc]] invasions in [[Eriador]] (cf. {{TA|2740}}).</ref>

In {{TA|2710}} King [[Déor]] asked his help to drive off the [[Dunlendings]] from the occupied [[Ring of Isengard]], but the Steward was unable to send help.<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref>

Egalmoth was followed by his son [[Beren (Steward of Gondor)|Beren]] at his death in {{TA|2743}}.<ref name="South"/>

==Etymology==
For the meaning of his name refer to [[Egalmoth#Etymology|Egalmoth - Etymology]]. It is possible that Egalmoth was named after [[Egalmoth]], an elvish lord of [[Gondolin]] in the [[First Age]].<ref>{{NM|P2v}}, footnote 3, p. 189</ref>
