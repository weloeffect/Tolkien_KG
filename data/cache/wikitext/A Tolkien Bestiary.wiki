==Reception==
The book has been accused of containing extrapolations and thus deviating from [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]'s writings.<ref>{{webcite|author=Steuard Jensen|articleurl=http://tolkien.slimy.com/essays/DayBooks.html|articlename=Notes on David Day's Tolkien Books|dated=|website=FAQ|accessed=11 April 2012}}</ref>
For example, there is a reference to "[[Wikipedia:Kraken|Kraken]]" referring to the [[Watcher in the Water]], but the word does not appear as a species in Tolkien's works.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.thetolkienforum.com/showthread.php?647-Tolkien-Bestiary|articlename=Tolkien Bestiary (forum thread)|dated=|website=[http://www.thetolkienforum.com/ The Tolkien Forum]|accessed=11 April 2012}}</ref>

While [[Tolkien fandom|fans]] have argued that the book is less reliable as a [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] reference than similar works by [[Robert Foster]] and [[J.E.A. Tyler]], many are fond of its illustrations.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.lotrplaza.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=215574&OB=DESC|articlename=A guide to Tolkien by David Day (forum thread)|dated=|website=[http://www.lotrplaza.com/forum/default.asp The Lord of the Rings Fanatics Plaza]|accessed=11 April 2012}}</ref>
