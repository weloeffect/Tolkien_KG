:Duinhir is the Lord of the [[Blackroot Vale]] with the seat in the town of Morlad. Duinhir is absolutely broken when both of his sons die during the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] but nevertheless joins the march of the Host of the West towards the [[Black Gate]]. Upon entering the [[Dagorlad]], his will fails completely and he becomes one of the faint-hearted, men who leave the main host with [[Aragorn]]'s permission. Duinhir then leads those men towards [[Cair Andros]], where they liberate the island from the forces of [[Mordor]].
