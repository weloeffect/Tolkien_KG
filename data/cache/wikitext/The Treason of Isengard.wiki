'''''The Treason of Isengard''''', published in [[1989]], is the seventh volume of [[Christopher Tolkien]]'s 12-volume book series, ''[[The History of Middle-earth]]'', in which he analyzes the unpublished manuscripts of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].

It is also the second volume of ''[[The History of The Lord of the Rings]]'', which documents the writing process of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

This book covers part of ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' and part of ''[[The Two Towers]]''. It continues to the meeting with [[Théoden]] king of [[Rohan]], and includes the invention and evolution of [[Lothlórien]] and [[Galadriel]]; plans for [[Frodo]] and [[Sam]]'s progress to [[Mordor]]; the invention and evolution of [[Treebeard]], the [[Ents]], and [[Fangorn Forest|Fangorn]]; discussions of the original map of Middle-earth at the end of the Third Age; and of the evolution of [[Cirth]] in an appendix.

The title ''The Treason of Isengard'' was the original title for Book III of ''TLotR'', eventually unused.

==Inscriptions==
There is an inscription in the [[Tengwar]] characters in the first pages of every ''History of Middle-earth'' volume, written by Christopher Tolkien and describing the contents of the book. The inscription in Book VII reads:

:"''In The Treason of Isengard the story of the Fellowship of the Ring is traced from Rivendell through Moria and the Land of Lothlórien to the time of its ending at Salembel beside Anduin the Great river, then is told of the return of Gandalf Mithrandir, of the meeting of the hobbits with Fangorn, and of the war upon the Riders of Rohan by the traitor Saruman.''"

==From the publisher==
{{blockquote|The second part of The History of The Lord of the Rings, an enthralling account of the writing of the Book of the Century which contains many additional scenes and includes the unpublished Epilogue in its entirety.<br>
The Treason of Isengard continues the account of the creation of ''The Lord of the Rings'' started in the earlier volume, ''[[The Return of the Shadow]]''. It traces the great expansion of the tale into new lands and new peoples south and east of the Misty Mountains: the emergence of Lothlórien, of Ents, of the [[Rohirrim|Riders of Rohan]], and of [[Saruman]] the White in the fortress of [[Isengard]].<br>
In brief outlines and penciled drafts dashed down on scraps of paper are seen the first entry of Galadriel, the earliest ideas of the history of [[Gondor]], and the original meeting of [[Aragorn]] and [[Éowyn]], its significance destined to be wholly transformed.<br>
The book also contains a full account of the original map which was to be the basis of the emerging geography of Middle-earth.}}
