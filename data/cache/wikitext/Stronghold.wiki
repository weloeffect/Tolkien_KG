}}'''''Stronghold''''' is the fourth full-length studio album by [[Summoning]] and was released in [[1999]]. Unlike the previous three studio albums, the album name is not [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]]-related. Only the song [[Rhûn (song)|Rhûn]] has a title directly referring to Tolkien. Despite many of the lyrics still being adapted from Tolkien's works, this album was the first to incorporate lyrics and audio samples from other works.<ref>{{Cite web|articleurl=https://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Summoning/Stronghold/114|articlename=Summoning - Stronghold Additional Notes|author=Metal Archives|accessed=26 July 2024|dated=4 June 2023}}</ref>
