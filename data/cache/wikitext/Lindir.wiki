'''Lindir''' was an Elf of [[Rivendell]]. 
== History ==
After [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s rendition of his ''[[Eärendillinwë]]'', Lindir claimed that he was unable to tell which parts were written by [[Aragorn]], and which by Bilbo himself, explaining that he knew little of [[Mortals]] and their ways.<ref>{{FR|II1}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Lindir'' seems to be composed of ''[[lind]]'' ("tune") + ''dîr'' ("man"), therefore meaning "Song Man".<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1574701031.html|articlename=S.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Lindir can be found in the [[Hall of Fire]] in [[Rivendell]]. He is engaged in a conversation with [[Bilbo Baggins]] and the two ask the player to join them in a [[Riddle-game]].

'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:'''
:Lindir is portrayed by [[Bret McKenzie]]. He welcomes Gandalf and the party of Dwarves to Rivendell in place of Elrond. Gandalf asks him where Elrond is and is answered by his horn, signalling Elrond and his companion's return from hunting Orcs. As Elrond and Gandalf speak, Elrond hands Lindir his spear. Later, after the dwarves have been living in Rivendell for a while, Lindir and Elrond talk. Lindir tells Elrond that the kitchen is under strain and that their supply of wine has almost drained by the Dwarves feasting, asking Elrond how long the Dwarves will stay. Elrond tells Lindir it has yet to be decided. They turn the corner and watch uncomfortably as the Dwarves play naked in the fountain. During a [[White Council]] meeting, Lindir reports to Lord Elrond that [[Thorin]] and his companions have departed in secret.<ref name="IMCasting">{{webcite|author=[[Ian McKellen]]|articleurl=http://www.mckellen.com/cinema/hobbit-movie/110510.htm|articlename=2 Elves and another Wizard|dated=10-May-2011|website=[http://www.mckellen.com/ Ian McKellen's website]|accessed=23-Dec-2011}}</ref> McKenzie also appeared in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]] as an extra dubbed "[[Figwit]]" by fans. It is unclear whether that character is intended to be Lindir.
