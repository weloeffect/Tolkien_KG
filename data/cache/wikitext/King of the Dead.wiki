The '''King of the Mountains''', or later, the '''King of the Dead''', was the ruler of the [[Oathbreakers]].

==History==
He was the King of the [[Oathbreakers|Men of the Mountains]], and when the [[Realms in Exile]] were founded, he met [[Isildur]] at [[Erech]] and swore his affiliation to [[Gondor]] on behalf of his people.

Then the time came when their former lord, [[Sauron]] arose again, and Isildur summoned them, but the Men of the Mountains were unwilling to turn against Sauron as they worshipped him during the [[Dark Years]]. Isildur cursed them for not fulfilling their oath, that there will be no other King after him, and they will never find rest until someone else calls for them.

His people dwindled and in the following centuries, the [[Wraiths|wraith]] of the '''King of the Dead''' was a terrifying rumour for the [[Gondorians|Men of Gondor]] south of the Mountains.

During the [[War of the Ring]], [[Aragorn]] came to the [[Paths of the Dead]] as the [[Heir of Isildur]] and offered them a way to redeem themselves. On their way to Erech, people were scared of the news that the King of the Dead was out again, and defenders and foes alike fled away.<ref>{{RK|Company}}</ref> 

The Oathbreakers followed the [[Grey Company]] to [[Pelargir]] where they drove off the enemy. Having fulfilled their oath, the King of the Dead broke and threw down his spear, bowed to [[Aragorn]] and turned away, as the Shadow Host vanished.<ref name = "Last Debate"></ref>

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:The King of the Dead is played by [[Paul Norell]].

'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The King of the Dead is named Rioc. Although his men were unwilling to fight [[Sauron]] because they had worshipped him, his excuse for not honoring the oath given to [[Isildur]] was because his daughter Bravantel had an out-of-wedlock child with one of his [[Númenórean]] warriors. He leads his people after joining [[Aragorn]]'s host and is freed after the liberation of [[Pelargir]].
