'''Meneldor''' was a great [[Eagles|Eagle]] of the northern mountains, one of the followers of [[Gwaihir|Gwaihir the Windlord]]. He was among the squadron of Eagles who flew to the aid of the [[Captains of the West]] in the last desperate battle before the [[Black Gate]] of [[Mordor]]. With his lord Gwaihir, and Gwaihir's brother [[Landroval]], he flew into the [[Mordor|Black Land]] to the rescue of [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], and carried one of these two (we are not told which) out of the destruction of [[Mount Doom]].<ref>{{RK|VI4}}, pp. 950-951</ref>

==Etymology==
''Meneldor'' is [[Sindarin]], being probably a combination of ''[[menel]]'' ("the heavens") + ''[[-dor]]''.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 625</ref>
