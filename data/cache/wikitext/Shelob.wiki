'''Shelob''' was a great spider-like creature akin to those of [[Nan Dungortheb]] in [[Beleriand]], the last offspring of [[Ungoliant]].

== Appearance ==
Shelob had an out-thrust head with two great clusters of many-windowed eyes<ref name="TT|Lair">{{TT|Lair}}, p. 720</ref> and great horns and a short stalk-like neck.<ref name=Body1>{{TT|Lair}}, p. 725</ref> Her head had a beak that dribbled venom.<ref name=Body2>{{TT|Choices}}, pp. 728-729</ref> She had a huge body that looked like a bloated bag. Her body was black and blotched with livid marks with a pale and luminous belly. She had bent legs with great knobbed joints that were located high above her back. Her legs had hairs that stuck out like steel spines and had a claw at each of their lower ends.<ref name=Body1/> Shelob also had a sting. Her skin was so thick that it could not be penetrated with the strength of a man, Elf or Dwarf, because it consisted of many layers of growth. It's still possible to make her impale or injure herself by making her apply her own weight on especially strong blades – a feat [[Sam]] accomplished with the sword [[Sting]]. Her eyes were the only softer spot, also very sensitive to light.<ref name=Body2/>

== History == 
Shelob was born as the last child of the spider-like being [[Ungoliant]],<ref name=Lair>{{TT|Lair}}, p. 723</ref> who had mated with and devoured other creatures of spider form in the valley of [[Nan Dungortheb]] in the mountains of [[Ered Gorgoroth]] in [[Beleriand]] in the [[Elder Days]].<ref>{{S|Flight}}</ref>

While dwelling in the Mountains of Terror, either Shelob or her kin fought [[Beren]] when he passed through to enter [[Doriath]].<ref name=Lair/>

Shelob fled from [[Beleriand|ruin]], and sometime during the [[Dark Years]], she came to [[Mordor]], though how she came to dwell there is unknown. However, she had already established her [[Shelob's Lair|lair]] high in the [[Ephel Dúath]] long before [[Sauron]] claimed Mordor as his own and started to build [[Barad-dûr]] around {{SA|1000}}.<ref>{{App|SA}}, entry for the year ''c.'' 1000, p. 1083</ref>

Shelob fed off of the blood of all living things, such as [[Elves]] and [[Men]], serving no one besides herself. Shelob mated with her offspring which she slew, and her lesser broods spread from valley to valley from the [[Ephel Dúath]] to the [[Eastern hills]], [[Dol Guldur]], and [[Mirkwood]].<ref name=Lair/><ref name=guide/>

As the power of Sauron grew, people left the borders of Mordor and [[Minas Ithil]] was [[Second Fall of Minas Ithil|conquered]] by the forces of [[Sauron]]. Elves and Men no longer came near to her lair and Shelob had to resort to hunt for [[Orcs]], which according to [[Gollum]], she considered to be poor food.<ref name=Lair/> Sauron knew that Shelob lived in her lair, but allowed her to dwell there, because she was an excellent guard of the pass of [[Cirith Ungol]] that led to Mordor and because he could spare the Orcs that she occasionally caught. He even sometimes had prisoners driven to her hole and ordered to report to him how she played with them and referred to her as ''his cat''.<ref>{{TT|Lair}}, p. 724</ref>

In {{TA|2980}}<ref>{{App|TA}}, enty for the year 2980, p. 1090</ref> while looking for [[the One Ring]], [[Gollum]] encountered Shelob. He had bowed to her and worshipped her, promising to bring her food.<ref name=Lair/> [[Shagrat]], the captain of the Orcs of the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]] supposed that Gollum was not good to eat for Shelob and it seemed to him that Gollum had an understanding with her.<ref name=Sneak>{{TT|Choices}}, p. 738</ref> Some time between the years {{TA|3009}} and {{TA|3017|n}} Gollum went to Mordor and was captured by Sauron.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 3009, p. 1090</ref> It is possible that he entered Mordor through the pass of Cirith Ungol. When Gollum was released from Barad-dûr in {{TA|3017}},<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 3017, p. 1090</ref> the Orcs of the Tower of Cirith Ungol had been ordered to let him pass and Shagrat knew that Gollum had used the [[Stairs of Cirith Ungol]] once or twice since then and referred to Gollum as Shelob's Sneak.<ref name=Sneak/>

Indeed, Gollum slipped away while [[Samwise Gamgee]] and [[Frodo Baggins]] were resting after they had climbed the Stairs of Cirith Ungol on their way to [[Mount Doom]]<ref>{{TT|Stairs}}, p. 713</ref> and visited Shelob again, bowing low before her on [[11 March]] {{TA|3019}}.<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019, March 11, p. 1093</ref> On the next day on [[March 12]] {{TA|3019}}.<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019, March 12, p. 1093</ref> Gollum led Sam and Frodo into the tunnels of Shelob's Lair and abandoned them in the dark.<ref>{{TT|Lair}}, p. 719</ref> He planned that Shelob would eat Sam and Frodo so that he could find the [[One Ring]] among the bones and clothes, which Shelob usually left behind.<ref name=Lair/>

After Frodo had used the [[Phial of Galadriel]] as a source of light and he and Sam were able to see two great clusters of many-windowed eyes of Shelob. When Frodo drew his sword and advanced on Shelob holding the phial up in the air, Shelob fled from the brightness of the phial.<ref>{{TT|Lair}}, pp. 720-721</ref> Frodo and Sam were able to flee from the tunnel to the outside to the pass of Cirith Ungol,<ref>{{TT|Lair}}, pp. 722-725</ref> but Shelob caught up with Frodo and stung him in the neck with her venomous sting, which caused a death-like coma.<ref>{{TT|Choices}}, p. 730</ref> Sam managed to defeat her by letting her impale herself upon [[Sting]] when she tried to crush him under her massive body and using all power of the Phial of Galadriel to blind her. Wounded, she fled to her lair and was not seen for the remainder of [[The Lord of the Rings]].<ref name="Body2"/>

=== Legacy ===
Thinking Frodo was dead, Sam took the One Ring from him and left his body behind, but discovered later that Shelob's venom was not intended to kill its victims but only to render them unconscious to keep their meat fresh.<ref>{{TT|Choices}}, pp. 731-740</ref>

It is not known if Shelob lay for years in her lair to heal herself from within and to rebuild her eyes until with hunger like death she was able to hunt again in the valleys of the [[Ephel Dúath]].<ref>{{TT|Choices}}, p. 729</ref> She may also have eventually died of starvation caused by her inability to hunt while blind.<ref name=guide>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 353, entry "Shelob"</ref>

== Etymology ==
''Shelob'' is a [[Westron]] name, which means "female spider".<ref name=L144>{{L|144}}</ref> It is a combination of the English word "she" (a "female")<ref name=L144/> and the dialectal English word<ref name=N>{{HM|N}}, entry '''Shelob''', p. 763</ref> "lob" ("spider").<ref name=L144/><ref name=N/><ref>{{L|70}}</ref>

[[Robert Foster]] mistakenly classified the name as [[Sindarin]], failing to provide a translation.<ref name=guide/>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In an earlier unpublished version of the chapter that would later have the title Shelob's Lair the description of the great spider-like creature was almost identical,<ref>{{WR|2|VIII}}, p. 196</ref> but its name was ''Ungoliant''<ref>{{WR|2|VIII}}, pp. 196, 199, 200, 205, 211</ref> or ''Ungoliante''.<ref>{{WR|2|VIII}}, p. 199</ref>

==Inspiration==
It has been considered that the giant spider which a hero fights is similar to creatures that appear in the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs, but Tolkien explicitly denied a direct influence.<ref>[[Letter to Richard Lupoff]]</ref>

'''1981: ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:Shelob was voiced by [[Jenny Lee]]. Lee had no dialogue, but hissed to convey Shelob's menace, then made a bubbling noise to suggest the passing of her poison into Frodo.  Finally, she made a roaring sound during her fight with Sam to convey her pain when Sam's thrusts found their mark. When the incident is described to [[Bilbo Baggins]], it is claimed that Shelob was killed.

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]:'''
:Shelob can be seen to have a retractable venomous sting at the rear end between the spinnerets, resembling a wasp's sting. This is very much unlike real spiders which inject venom with their fangs but accurate relative to the novel. Shelob also appears to have a gaping mouth, whereas real spiders can ingest only liquid. In the book, "clusters" of eyes are mentioned,<ref name="TT|Lair"/> which may suggest compound eyes like those of insects; the Shelob in the movie does ''not'' have compound eyes.

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]:'''
:Shelob is a playable hero for the Goblins faction, and appears in the fifth level of the Evil Campaign, "Mirkwood", where she has apparently joined the [[Mouth of Sauron]] on his mission to take the [[Old Forest Road]]. During the level, Shelob can be used to recruit the Spiders of Mirkwood, as they are her children, and will obey her if she is sent to their nest. She also appears during the final mission, "Rivendell", alongside the other villains.

'''2014: ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]:'''
:Though unseen, Shelob is identified in the Appendices as the mother of the Ungol spiders that are encountered throughout Mordor. She is also referred to as the Spider Queen, a title that wasn't given to her in the book. An artefact, a "Crushed Ungol Egg", shows that Shelob initially lived in Mordor itself with Sauron and his servants, until it became apparent that Shelob would disobey Sauron, so he banished her to the pass of Cirith Ungol, and forbade her from laying any more eggs on his land. According to the "Ungol" article in the Appendices, Shelob has taken an interest in the recent events occurring in Mordor, though it is unclear to what extent. 

'''2017: ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]]:'''
:Shelob is voiced by Pollyanna McIntosh, and plays a prominent role early in the game. This portrayal of Shelob is unique in that she is able to assume a fair form, as a raven-haired woman in a black dress. She can also project visions of the future into a person's mind. She ensnares the wraith of [[Celebrimbor]] and holds him prisoner at the start of the game. She releases him after Talion surrenders their newly-forged Ring of Power to her. After Minas Ithil is conquered by Sauron's forces, the Ringwraiths are sent to seize the Ring from her. After the Nine are driven away, she gives the Ring back to Talion and tells him to forge an army to conquer Mordor.
: Reading her memories, which are found throughout Mordor, reveals a number of details of her life, including a romantic relationship she once had with Sauron.

'''2019: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
: Shelob is known to [[Elves]] as "Ungwetári" and Lord [[Celeborn]] had hunted her down in the early years of the [[Third Age]], to no avail. Shelob has a mental link to her children and after being stabbed by [[Samwise]] she summons all of her children to her side for nourishment and protection. Places formerly infested with [[spiders]] such as [[Mirkwood]] become empty as whole nests of them travel south to the call of their mother. Shelob herself is depicted as much larger than other giant spiders, which are encountered in the game on numerous occasions. Shelob herself is the last boss in the main raid of the [[Minas Morgul]] expansion.
