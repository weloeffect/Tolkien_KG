'''Tarondor''' ({{TA|372}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 292</ref>-{{TA|602|n}},<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 230) was the seventh [[King of Arnor]].

==History==
Tarondor was the son of King [[Tarcil]], and succeeded his father when he died in [[Third Age 515]]. 

He ruled the [[Arnor|North-kingdom]] in a time of peace, long before the troubles came that would overwhelm and destroy it. He ruled for eighty-seven years, and was succeeded by his son, [[Valandur]], when he died in [[Third Age 602]].<ref name="North"/>

==Etymology==
''Tarondor'' is a [[Quenya]] name. Its meaning is not glossed, but Paul Strack suggests it means "King of Stones" and is a compound of ''[[tar]]'' ("high", "king") and the plural form of ''[[ondo]]'' ("stone").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-426862149.html|articlename=Q.
