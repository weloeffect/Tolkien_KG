'''Ciryon''' was the third son of [[Isildur]].

==History==
In the War of the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]], Ciryon and his brother [[Aratan]] did not participate in the [[Siege of Barad-dûr]].  Isildur had sent these two brothers to man [[Minas Ithil]] so as to guard [[Cirith Dúath]] and prevent a possible breakout of [[Sauron]] should he escape the siege.<ref>{{UT|11b}}</ref>

In the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]], Ciryon was the first brother to die; Aratan was mortally wounded while trying to save him.  After the fall of these two brothers, [[Elendur (son of Isildur)|Elendur]] advised his father to put on [[the One Ring]] and escape.<ref>{{UT|Gladden}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Ciryon'' is a [[Quenya]] name. Its meaning is not glossed and is unclear. Paul Strack suggests it contains the element ''[[cirya]]'' ("ship").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-3767533331.html|articlename=Q.

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In early manuscripts, Ciryon was named ''Vëandur''.<ref name="Elendil"/>{{rp|191}}

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2019: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The three elder sons of Isildur appear during an extended flashback set during the [[Siege of Barad-dûr]] in the year [[Second Age 3440|S.A. 3440]]. However, because the game's license does not cover the works in which they are named, they are referred to only by their war-time aliases, meant to hide their kinship with the King. Ciryon uses the name "Vëamacil" as his alias.
