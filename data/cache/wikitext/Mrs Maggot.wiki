'''Mrs. Maggot''' was the wife of the [[Farmer Maggot]]. Their home was the farm [[Bamfurlong]] and they had at least two sons and three daughters.

Mrs. Maggot served [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] when her husband hosted them. When the Farmer took the [[Hobbits]] to the Ferry, Mrs. Maggot sent with him a basket of [[mushrooms]] for Frodo, knowing how much he liked them.<ref name="mushroom">{{FR|I4}}</ref>
