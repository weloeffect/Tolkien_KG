'''Mount Hyarmentir''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[çarˈmentir]}}) was a mighty mountain to the south and east of [[Valinor]], perhaps of the [[Pelóri]].<ref name=guide/><ref>{{HM|AME}}</ref> It was one of the tallest in [[Aman]], but not as [[Taniquetil]] to the north, which was the tallest of the world.<ref name=annals>{{AA|107|P2k}}, pp. 98, 105</ref><ref name=darkening>{{MR|P3II7}}, pp. 285, 291 (§56d)</ref>

[[Morgoth|Melkor]] and [[Ungoliant]] climbed it, as Ungoliant wrought her webs between clefts and pinnacles. From its summit, they looked out over the Tree-lit land of the [[Valar]], before they descended Mount Hyarmentir's long, shallow western slopes and set out to destroy the [[light of Valinor|light]] of the [[Two Trees]].<ref name=annals/><ref name=darkening/><ref>{{S|8}}</ref>

==Etymology==
