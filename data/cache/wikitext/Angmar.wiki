'''Angmar''' ([[Quenya|Q]]/[[Sindarin|S.]] ''Iron Home'') was a realm in the far north of the [[Misty Mountains]],<ref>{{FR|Map}}</ref> which was founded by the Lord of the [[Nazgûl]], who became known as the [[Witch-king]] of Angmar.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry about King Eärnil II, p. 1051</ref><ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1409, p. 1086</ref> The capital of Angmar was [[Carn Dûm]].<ref>{{FR|Barrow}}, "the evil king of Carn Dûm", p. 146</ref>

== History ==
Around {{TA|1300}}, [[Sauron|Sauron's]] [[shadow]] became stronger and evil things multiplied, heralded by the reappearance of the [[Nazgûl]].<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year ''c.'' 1300, p. 1086</ref> The lord of the Nazgûl came north and established the evil realm of Angmar between the [[Ettenmoors]] and the [[Mountains of Angmar]] on both sides of the [[Misty Mountains]], because he intended to destroy the [[Dúnedain of the North]] and to exploit the disunity of the splinter realms of [[Arthedain]], [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]]. He gathered many evil men, Orcs and other fell creatures in Angmar and became known as the Witch-king of Angmar, but it was not known at that time that he was the lord of the Nazgûl.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, entry about King Malvegil, p. 1040</ref>

Rhudaur was the first kingdom to fall. There were few [[Dúnedain of the North|Dúnedain]] in Rhudaur and an evil lord of the Hillmen, who had a secret alliance with Angmar, seized the power. As a consequence, [[Argeleb I]], the king of Arthedain fortified the line of the [[Weather Hills]],<ref name=Argeleb>{{App|Eriador}}, entry for King Argeleb I, p. 1040</ref> which formed the eastern border between the realm of Arthedain and the realm of Rhudaur.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', p. 1040</ref> Nevertheless, Argeleb I was killed in a battle with the realms of Rhudaur and Angmar. However, his son [[Arveleg I]] managed to push back the forces of his enemies from the Weather hills with help from Cardolan and Lindon.<ref name=Argeleb/> After that Arthedain and Cardolan maintained a line of defence along the [[Weather Hills]], the [[Great East Road]] and the lower [[Hoarwell]] for many years.<ref name=Arveleg>{{App|Eriador}}, entry about King Arveleg, p. 1040</ref>

In {{TA|1409}} a large army from Angmar invaded Cardolan and besieged [[Weathertop]]. The forces of Angmar defeated the Dúnedain, killed King Arveleg I and burned and destroyed the Tower of Amon Sûl, which stood on Weathertop. However, the ''[[Palantíri|palantír]]'' that was located in the tower was evacuated during the retreat to [[Fornost Erain]]. Rhudaur was occupied by evil men, which were subject to the realm of Angmar and the Dúnedain that had remained in Rhudaur were killed or fled to the west. Cardolan was devastated, but a remnant of the Dúnedain of Cardolan defended the [[Barrow-downs]] or fled to the [[Old Forest]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, entries about King Arveleg and King Araphor, pp. 1040-41</ref> The [[last prince of Cardolan]] was slain in that year and was said to have been buried in the barrow in the Barrow-downs in which [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and [[Frodo Baggins]] were trapped by a [[Barrow-wight]] almost 1700 years later.<ref name=ArgelebII>{{App|Eriador}}, entry about King Argeleb II, p. 1041</ref> King [[Araphor]], the brave young son of Arveleg I, drove away the forces of the enemy from Fornost and the [[North Downs]] with the aid of  [[Círdan]] and the [[Elves of Lindon]]. The [[Elves]] from [[Rivendell]] and [[Elves of Lórien]] also attacked the forces of Angmar and managed to subdue Angmar for a time. Because of the war with Angmar and of their fear of Angmar, the [[Stoors]] who lived in the [[Angle]] in Rhudaur fled to the west, to the south or returned east to [[Rhovanion]] to live next to the river [[Gladden]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, entry about King Araphor, p. 1040</ref>

During the reign of King [[Argeleb II]] most people of Cardolan, especially in [[Minhiriath]] died in the [[Great Plague]], which brought an end to the Dúnedain of Cardolan. As a consequence, evil [[Barrow-wights|spirits]] from Angmar and Rhudaur occupied the deserted mounds.<ref name=ArgelebII/>

King [[Araphant]] and his son King [[Arvedui]] continued to defend Arthedain against assaults of Angmar, but the strength of Arthedain was dwindling. In the autumn of {{TA|1973}} the kingdom of [[Gondor]] received messages that Arthedain was in great danger, because the Witch-king of Angmar was preparing an attack against it. In response, King [[Eärnil II]] of Gondor sent his son [[Eärnur]] north with a fleet as fast as he was able.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry about King Eärnil II, p. 1050</ref>

In {{TA|1974}} Angmar had recovered and invaded Arthedain from the north before the end of the winter.<ref name=Arvedui>{{App|Eriador}}, entry about King Arvedui, pp. 1041-43</ref> The Witch-king overran Arthedain and conquered [[Fornost]] before the end of the year<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1974, p. 1086</ref> and drove away most of the remaining Dúnedain over the river [[Lhûn]], including the sons of the king.<ref name=Arvedui/> King [[Arvedui]] of Arthedain defended the North Downs as long as he could until he had to flee to the north with some of his guards on horses. Arvedui hid in tunnels of old dwarf-mines at the northern end of the [[Blue Mountains]] until his supplies ran out and then fled to a camp of the [[Lossoth]] at the southern shore of the [[Icebay of Forochel]] where he was forced to wait. The Elves of Lindon heard of the flight of Arvedui to the north and sent a ship to rescue Arvedui, but it sank shortly after picking up Arvedui in the bay of [[Forochel]] when the ship was driven back to the ice by a storm and was crushed by further ice that was piled up against it in March<ref name=Arvedui/> {{TA|1975}}.<ref name=TA1975>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1975, p. 1086</ref>

When Prince Eärnur of Gondor arrived with his fleet at the havens of [[Lindon]] in {{TA|1975}}<ref name=TA1975/> it was too late, because Arthedain had already been conquered and King Arvedui was already dead. Círdan gathered a force from [[Lindon]] and [[Arnor]] and the combined forces of Lindon, Arnor and Gondor, which included tall and fair riders, princes from Rhovanion and horses from the [[Vales of Anduin]] crossed the river Lhûn and marched north. The Witch-king came from Fornost with the forces of Angmar to meet them, but was defeated in a battle on the plain between [[Lake Evendim]] and the North Downs. The Witch-king fled northwards with a remnant of his forces in the direction of Angmar, but his forces were overtaken by the cavalry of Gondor and by forces led by the Elf-lord [[Glorfindel]] who came north from Rivendell before they could reach the shelter of [[Carn Dûm]]. The Witch-king was able to escape from the north on a black horse, but the realm of Angmar was utterly defeated so that no Men and Orcs of Angmar remained on the west side of the Misty Mountains.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry about King Ondoher, p. 1049 and entry about King Eärnil II, pp. 1049-51</ref>

The [[Éothéod]], the ancestors of the [[Rohirrim]], lived in the vales of Anduin between the [[Carrock]] and the [[Gladden]] in those days. The middle vales of the Anduin were populated by many Men and the shadow of [[Dol Guldur]] grew at that time. When the Éothéod heard that the Witch-king of Angmar had been defeated, they wanted to obtain more territory in the north and drove away the remnants of the people of Angmar on the east side of the Misty Mountains.<ref name=Eorl>{{App|Eorl}}, p. 1064</ref> It is possible that the Éothéod heard of the defeat of Angmar from riders from the Vales of Anduin who defeated Angmar as part of the cavalry of Eärnur. As a result the Éothéod moved north from their old land to the region near the sources of the Anduin between the northernmost ranges of the Misty Mountains and the norhernmost parts of Mirkwood.<ref name=Eorl/>

== Etymology ==
{{Pronounce|Angmar.mp3|Ardamir}}
''Angmar'' seems to be a corrupted [[Sindarin]] or [[Quenya]] name.<ref name="RC">{{HM|RC}}, p. 20 citing from J.R.R. Tolkien's manuscript for ''Nomenclature''</ref> [[Paul Strack]] suggests that it means "Iron Home".<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-3089760465.html|articlename=S. ''Angmar'' loc.|website=[http://eldamo.org/index.html Eldamo - An Elvish Lexicon]|accessed=2 May 2019}}</ref> 
It is a compound of ''[[anga]]'' ("iron") and ''[[MBAR|mbar]]'' ("habitation"). The name would be ''angbar'' in pure Sindarin and ''angamar'' in pure Quenya.<ref name="RC"/>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king]]'':'''
:Angmar is a playable faction in the game, featuring mostly heroes and units not found within Tolkien's [[Legendarium]]. Moreover, during the game's campaign, Angmar is besieged in [[Carn Dûm]] by [[Glorfindel]] and his [[Elves]], however he wins the siege and destroys [[Arnor]] and [[Fornost]].

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Angmar map.jpg|thumb|Map of Angmar from ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]
:Angmar was not completely destroyed after the [[Battle of Fornost]]. Rather, the Witch-King changed [[Eärnur]] into a wraith to watch over his kingdom until it could rise once more. By the time of the [[War of the Ring]] the kingdom of Angmar was once again strong enough to threaten [[Eriador]]. The [[Men]] of Angmar were of two distinct cultures. The ruling class of [[Carn Dûm]] consisted of the Angmarim, who had [[Black Númenóreans|Black Númenórean]] blood and were staunch followers of [[Sauron]] and his servants. The others were the tribes of [[Hill-men]], native folk who continued their old traditions. One tribe, the [[Trév Gállorg]], opposed the False King and is friendly to the [[Free peoples]]. Their rivals, the Trév Duvárdain, broke away from them to ally with the Angmarim. Angmar is also home to many creatures such as [[Wargs]], [[Drakes]], [[Spiders]], [[Vampires#Portrayal in adaptations|Merrevail]], and Gertheryg. Four tribes of [[orcs]], the Blogmal, the Krahjarn, the Ongbǘrz, and the Tarkrîp, originate from Angmar.

:The region was accessible from the [[North Downs]] by travelling through the Ram Dúath, a range of winding canyons in the south-west of Angmar. Within Ram Dúath were camps of the Angmarim and orcs marching to war, and also the peaceful Earth-kin village Lehmä-koti. North of the Ram Dúath were the grey hills of Fasach-Larran and Fasach-Falroid, where the Hill-men of Angmar dwelt. At the westernmost exit of the Ram Dúath was the Trév Gállorg village of Aughaire. The hostile Trév Duvárdain inhabited towns and camps in the north.

:To the east of the hills was the great brimstone swamp of Malenhad. The dread Watching-stones of the Rammas Deluon formed a barrier of deadly fear down the middle of Malenhad, effectively separating the western half of Angmar from the eastern half. The shallow sulfur lake Duvuinen lay in the east of Malenhad. Hidden in a cavern to the south of the lake was the Dwarf-outpost Gabilshathûr. In the south-east of Angmar beyond the lake were the valleys of Gorothlad, home to orcs, [[trolls]], and other creatures. Gorothlad contained several camps for Angmar's growing orc army as well as the arena of Maethad. North of Gorothlad was the rocky basin Nan Gurth, in the center of which stood Barad Gúlaran and its ring of eight lesser towers.

:West of Nan Gurth was Imlad Balchorth, a valley full of tombs and poisoned water, haunted by many [[wights]] and fell-spirits. In the north-east of Nan Gurth was Gath Uior, a pass to the Rift of Nûrz Ghâshu in the far north-east of Angmar near to the northernmost of the [[Misty Mountains]]. Deep underground within the Rift the [[Balrog]] Thaurlach was kept imprisoned after his defeat by the [[Blue Wizards]]. Fire-orcs and [[nameless things]] also dwelt there, though they were opposed by a mysterious race of [[Giants|fire-giants]] known as the Eldgang.

:North-west of Nan Gurth and north-east of Imlad Balchorth was Himbar, an ashen, spider-infested land among crags of black rock like obsidian. Up a path into the rock walls that bordered Himbar in the east was the secret [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]] refuge of Gath Forthnír. In the west of Himbar was the Angmarim town Rhunendin, and beyond that was a long gated pass to the capital city of [[Carn Dûm]]. In the south-west of the capital was a narrow, winding pass, guarded by [[Watchers of Cirith Ungol|Watching-stones]], that connected to the lands of the hill-men in the north of Fasach-Falroid. The host of Angmar marched to the southern lands along a main road that led south from Rhunendin between Imlad Balchorth and Nan Gurth, then turned west to pass north of Malenhad. Beyond Malenhad the road turned south to enter the Ram Dǘath.

'''2012: ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'':'''
:Angmar and the [[Angmar conflict|conflict]] with [[Arnor]] are mentioned by Galadriel in the [[White Council]]. Following the [[Battle of Fornost|destruction]] of Angmar, the Men of the North took the body of the Witch-king and sealed him in [[High Fells of Rhudaur]].

'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''
:[[Gandalf]] tells [[Thranduil]] and [[Bard]] that [[Sauron|Sauron's]] final goal was to conquer the [[Lonely Mountain]] due to its strategic position. This would enable Sauron to restore Angmar and gain dominance over the north of [[Middle-earth]].

'''2016: ''[[Third Age: Total War]] - [[Divide and Conquer (MII:TW mod)|Divide and Conquer]]'':'''
:Following Angmar's destruction, only a few of the Witch-king's servants gathered in the lands that once stood as his domain, with the descendants of those few gathering in the old fortresses. They waited patiently and diligently for their master's return, but let the very hillmen that they once ruled over colonise the territories of Rhuduar, which they claimed as their own. As the ring once again called for its master, Sauron sent his Nazgûl to Eriador, where the Witch-king took the remnants of his Kingdom and demanded his servants to go forth and wage war once again in the name of the Iron Crown.

:A new overlord is selected by the Witch-king to unite the land of Rhudaur, call forth the orcish denizens of Mount Gram, and muster a great host to destroy the Free Peoples and conquer their lands in the name of Sauron, knowing that Gondor will not go to the aid of the North as they are focusing their efforts on Mordor and their Easterling vassels. Only when Eriador has been dominated by the Iron Crown may the Kingdom of Angmar truly rise from the ashes and claim the glory that it was denied centuries beforehand.
