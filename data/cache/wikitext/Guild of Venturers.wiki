The '''Guild of Venturers''' was a brotherhood of mariners and seamen formed by the Great Captain [[Tar-Aldarion|Aldarion]] in the year {{SA|750}}.<ref>{{UT|Wife}}, Notes, ''Chronology''</ref> 

== History ==
The Guild had no fixed guildhouse on land, but was based instead on the ship ''[[Eämbar]]'', that had been built for the purpose. ''Eämbar'' was sailed at times to different harbours of [[Númenor]], but was normally anchored off the island of [[Tol Uinen]] in the bay of [[Rómenna]]. The sailors of the Guild went much farther than this, though, steering their vessels east across the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]] to the distant shores of [[Middle-earth]]. There, they visited [[Gil-galad]] in [[Lindon]], and explored the coastlands into the far south.<ref name=Wife>{{UT|Wife}}</ref>

They were called '''''Uinendili''''', the "Lovers of [[Uinen]]", the [[Maia]] of the [[Seas]].<ref name=Wife>{{UT|Wife}}</ref>{{rp|176}}

::While the guild itself is referred to as the '''Sea Guard'''. it functions in a similar fashion, being made up of the [[Men]] of [[Númenor]] who love [[Belegaer]]. Any cadet seeking admission into the guild must pass the '''Sea Trial''', or else be banished from being admitted. After every voyage, the [[Sail Master]] leads the cadets in praising the sea saying that "''the sea is always right!''".
