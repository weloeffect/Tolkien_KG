'''Samwise Gamgee''', commonly known as '''Sam''', was [[Frodo Baggins]]' servant and the only original member of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] to remain with him to the very end of the journey to [[Mount Doom]].

==History==
===Early life===
Samwise lived with his father, [[Hamfast Gamgee]], better known as "The Gaffer", on [[Bagshot Row]] in [[The Shire]], close to [[Bag End]]. Sam's mother was [[Bell Gamgee|Bell Goodchild]]; he had five siblings: [[Hamson Gamgee|Hamson]], [[Halfred Gamgee|Halfred]], [[Daisy Gamgee|Daisy]], [[May Gamgee|May]], and [[Marigold Gamgee|Marigold]]. He was a friend of the [[Cotton Family|Cotton family]] and used to play in [[Bywater Pool]] with [[Wilcome Cotton II|Jolly]], [[Tolman Cotton Junior|Tom]], [[Carl Cotton|Nibs]], and [[Rose Cotton|Rosie Cotton]] specifically.<ref>{{RK|VI3}}</ref>

A gardener by trade, Sam seemed to be a simple [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of plain speech. He helped his Gaffer tending the garden of Bag End and was taught the art of rope making by his [[Hobson|grandfather]] and his uncle [[Andwise Roper|Andy]]. In his work at Bag-End, he was acquainted with [[Bilbo Baggins]]. Bilbo taught him [[tengwar|letters]], and nurtured his love for [[Elves]], poetry, and his belief that the world contains greater wonders than most hobbits are aware of. This set him apart from the beginning to the Gaffer's dismay.<ref>{{FR|Party}};{{TT|Taming}}</ref> Sam often wandered outside [[Hobbiton]] and knew well the area twenty miles around.<ref name=three>{{FR|Three}}</ref>

On [[12 April]] Sam was in ''[[The Green Dragon]]'' and discussed with [[Ted Sandyman]] the strange rumours he heard around the Shire, including his [[Hal Gamgee|cousin Hal]] seeing a [[Tree-men|Tree-man]], and the [[Elves]] who leave [[Middle-earth]]. Ted called his cousin crazy and dismissed all rumours. In the evening, he returned to [[Hobbiton Hill]] thinking about the hard work he has to do when he saw [[Gandalf]] arriving to visit Frodo, after many years.<ref name=shadow>{{FR|Shadow}}</ref>

===Eavesdropping on Frodo and Gandalf===
Sam was one of the "[[Conspirators]]" who were summoned by [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry Brandybuck]] in order to watch over [[Frodo Baggins]] and the [[The One Ring|Ring]] inherited by Frodo from Bilbo. Being the closest to Frodo, Sam was their "chief investigator" who was to eavesdrop on his talks with Gandalf the [[Wizards|Wizard]].<ref>{{FR|Conspiracy}}</ref>

He eavesdrops on Frodo and Gandalf's discussion while working at the garden of Bag End. It was when Gandalf revealed to Frodo that Bilbo's ring is [[Sauron]]'s One Ring, and on the mention that Frodo must leave the Shire, Sam choked. Initially suspected as a spy, Sam feigned innocent curiosity. Sam begged Gandalf not to turn him into anything "unnatural". Sam then immediately asked to be taken to see Elves when they went away. Gandalf decided to make Sam Frodo's first companion.<ref name=shadow/> 

===From Hobbiton to Crickhollow===
Sam joined Frodo on his journey to [[Bree]] and [[Rivendell]], as to outside appearances as Frodo's gardener. He lied that he had the lightest baggage after Frodo complained about the weight of his, and he offered to take more. Sam and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin Took]] followed Frodo to his new house at [[Crickhollow]] and when they were encountered by [[Black Riders]] Sam mentioned that one of those was asking his father about Frodo. Later they met one of the [[Wandering Companies]] of Elves; the experience of meeting Elves the first time left him speechless (although they were different than he expected, ''"so old and young, and so gay and sad, as it were,"'' as Sam described them<ref name="short">{{FR|Mushrooms}}, p. 87</ref>); the hobbits camped with them and Sam was like in a living dream, mentioning it as one of the most important events of his life. He was enchanted especially by their singing.<ref name=three/> The Elves warned him not to leave Frodo on his journey, and Sam denied he would ever think about it.<ref name=short/>

The next day Sam insisted that Pippin should leave some elven bread for their breakfast. That morning, Sam felt changed, feeling that he had to fulfill a role that lies beyond the Shire, something more important than meeting Elves or [[dragons]] or seeing mountains.<ref name=short/>

At Crickhollow where his and the Conspirators' role was revealed. Merry joined the travellers on their way to Bree.

===Crickhollow to Rivendell===
The hobbits decided to risk travelling through the [[Old Forest]] to avoid Black Riders. There [[Old Man Willow]] put a spell of sleepiness on the four hobbits. Once Merry and Pippin slept by the tree and Frodo bathed his feet in the [[Withywindle]], the willow tree tried to drown Frodo and swallowed Merry and Pippin, but Sam proved the most resistant. He saved Frodo from drowning and tried to start a fire to frighten Old Man Willow but the tree threatened to squeeze the hobbits in two if he did not put it out. They were saved by Tom Bombadil and stayed in his house for two days. Sam was the only hobbit who slept contentedly.<ref>{{FR|Forest}}; {{FR|Bombadil}}</ref>

They passed through [[Barrow-downs]] and came to [[the Prancing Pony]] at Bree where they were joined by "[[Strider (Aragorn)|Strider]]". Sam did not trust the ranger at first, but Frodo accepted his help as they could not get to Rivendell otherwise. [[Sauron]]'s spies had opened the stables of the inn and all the mounts went loose, therefore before leaving the village, the company purchased a [[Ponies|pony]] from [[Bill Ferny]]. Sam loved and tended the animal, and named him [[Bill the Pony|Bill]], after his owner. Upon their departure, Bill Ferney saw and taunted them. In response, Sam threw an apple at his head.<ref>{{FR|Sign}}; {{FR|Strider}}; {{FR|Knife}}</ref>

As they came to [[Weathertop]], Sam recited a poem about Gil-Galad that Bilbo had taught him.<ref>{{FR|Knife}}, p. 186</ref> After Frodo was stabbed by a Ringwraith, his distrust toward Strider only grew, and he was distraught when he learned that Frodo's wound might subdue him to the Black Riders' will. When the group came to the old place where [[Tom]], [[Bert]], and [[William]] had been turned to stone, he sang "[[The Stone Troll]]", an original composition of his, for the others.<ref>{{FR|Flight}}</ref>

===Fellowship of the Ring===
When they reached [[Rivendell]], Sam was beside Frodo's bed while he was recovering from the [[Morgul-wound]] he was inflicted on Weathertop and hardly left except to run messages. Once Frodo awoke, Sam led him to join the rest of the party. He had begged to wait on Frodo but was told that for this time he was a guest of honor. When Frodo reunited with Bilbo, Sam sat near near them and listened as they spoke together until he fell asleep.<ref>{{FR|II1}}</ref>

The following day, Sam eavesdropped on the [[Council of Elrond]] and remained silent until it was revealed that Frodo would be the [[Ring-bearers|Ringbearer]]. Then Sam was unable to contain himself any longer and revealed himself, asking if Frodo was meant to go alone, to which [[Elrond]] responded that he at least should accompany Frodo as it is impossible to separate them, even when Frodo is invited to a secret council and Sam is not.<ref>{{FR|Many}}; {{FR|Council}}, p. 270-271</ref>

[[File:John_Howe_-_Watcher_in_the_Water.jpg‎|thumb|150px|left|''Watcher in the Water'' by [[John Howe]]]]
Sam insisted on bringing Bill along on the journey, saying he would pine if he did not come. At that point, he lamented that he had not brought rope but found that it was too late to find some now.<ref>{{FR|South}}, p. 280</ref> Sam was dismayed when he learned they were to enter [[Moria]], and he was even more dismayed that they had to send Bill away when they entered Moria when wolves were about. Sam saved Frodo's life as the [[Watcher in the Water]] tried to seize him with one of its tentacles. As they passed by  fissures and chasms there, Sam once again remarked that he wished he had brought rope. Sam received a scratch along his scalp for his first orc kill in the mines. When Frodo was pinned against the wall by an Orc-spear, Sam hacked and broke the spear-shaft.<ref>{{FR|Journey}};{{FR|Bridge}}</ref>

In [[Lothlórien]], the Elves remarked that Sam breathed so loudly that they could shoot him in the dark. Sam was the only one of the four hobbits who had no trouble sleeping upon the Elves' [[flet]], and he remarked that he will go on sleeping whether or not he rolled off in his slumber.<ref>{{FR|Lorien}}, p. 342, 344</ref> In [[Cerin Amroth]], once the Fellowship was unblindfolded, Sam was surprised by the bright daylight in an Elven realm, and he remarked that he "thought that Elves were all for moon and stars: but this is more elvish than anything I ever heard tell of".<ref>{{FR|Lorien}}, p. 351</ref>

Sam made a verse in honour of Gandalf's fireworks. He, along with Frodo, looked into the [[Mirror of Galadriel]] where he saw trees being felled and that the Old Mill had been replaced by a large red-brick building. Sam considered going back to help those at home, but, being warned by [[Galadriel]] not to let the mirror decide his choices, Sam decided to finish his task with Frodo. At their parting from Lórien, Galadriel [[Gifts of Galadriel|gave]] Sam a [[Sam's garden box|box]] containing earth from her orchard.<ref>{{FR|Mirror}};{{FR|Farewell}}</ref>

===Journey to Mordor===
At the [[Falls of Rauros]] Frodo tried to leave the Fellowship secretly by boat, but Sam pursued him and leapt into the water although he could not swim. Thus after the [[Breaking of the Fellowship]], Sam was the only member of the Fellowship to remain with Frodo.<ref name="breaking"/>
[[File:The Brothers Hildebrandt - Faramir.png|thumb|250px|"[[Faramir]]" by [[The Brothers Hildebrandt]]]]
When [[Gollum]] joined up with them, Sam remained distrustful of his loyalty to Frodo, and treated him with disdain, and partially (though unintentionally) pushed Gollum to betray Frodo in [[Shelob's Lair]].<ref>{{L|165}}</ref><ref>{{L|96}}</ref>
As Sam, Frodo, and Gollum travelled, Sam began to worry about their food supplies running short and he, unlike Frodo, still thought of the return journey.<ref>{{TT|Passage}}</ref> In [[Ithilien]], he decided to risk a fire and stew rabbit, but he accidentally let it smoke which attracted the attention of [[Faramir]] and his rangers who were also in that region. There, to Sam's delight, he got the chance to see an [[oliphaunt]]. Faramir took the hobbits to [[Henneth Annûn]] where Sam accidentally revealed the purpose of their quest, but Faramir did not hinder it and Sam judged his quality to be "the very highest.", saying he reminded him of Gandalf.<ref>{{TT|Herbs}}; {{TT|Window}}</ref>

Gollum led the hobbits to the [[Stairs of Cirith Ungol]], where Sam, in a conversation with Frodo, reflected on whether their adventure would be put in tales and songs to be told by a fireside and noted that they were part of a greater tale than themselves.<ref name="TT|Stairs">{{TT|Stairs}}</ref>
[[File:Irvin Rodriguez - Samwise the Stouthearted.jpg|thumb|''Samwise the Stouthearted'' by [[:Category:Images by Irvin Rodriguez|Irvin Rodriguez]]]]
Gollum betrayed the hobbits in [[Shelob's lair]], hoping to find the Ring among Frodo's bones once [[Shelob]] had eaten him. However, Sam pierced Shelob's flesh, being the first person ever to have done so, but not before Shelob seemingly killed Frodo.

Grieving for Frodo, Sam took the Ring. At first, he was tempted to go on a quest for revenge on Gollum but instead chose to complete the quest. However, upon learning that Frodo still lived, he rescued him from the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]] and returned the Ring to him. Because he held the Ring for a time, he is considered one of the [[Ring-bearers]].<ref>{{TT|Choices}};{{RK|Tower}}</ref>

Together, Sam and Frodo crossed [[Mordor]] to [[Mount Doom]]. Sam himself carried Frodo up the slope for part of the way. There, Gollum tried to attack the hobbits and Sam spared his life now he had an idea of what it had been like for Gollum to be Ring-bearer—a choice which soon led to success in their quest. After the destruction of the Ring, both Sam and Frodo were honoured by [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] for their deeds.<ref>{{RK|Doom}}; {{RK|Field}}</ref>

===Later life===
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Sam and Rosie Cotton.jpg|thumb|left|''Sam and Rosie Cotton'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
After the [[War of the Ring]], and the [[Scouring of the Shire]], Sam planted saplings in all the places where specially beautiful and beloved trees had been destroyed, and he put a grain of Galadriel's soil at the root of each. He was especially shocked that the [[Party Tree]] was cut down and planted a silver nut in the [[Party Field]] where it had once been, and the nut grew into the [[Golden Tree]], the only [[Mallorn]] tree in the Shire.

He married [[Rose Cotton|Rose "Rosie" Cotton]] on [[1 May]] {{SR|1420}}.<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref> In honor for restoring the Shire his family was given the name [[Gardner Family|Gardner]]. 

They had thirteen children: [[Elanor Gardner|Elanor the Fair]], [[Frodo Gardner|Frodo]], [[Rose Gardner|Rose]], [[Merry Gardner|Merry]], [[Pippin Gardner|Pippin]], [[Goldilocks Gardner|Goldilocks]], [[Hamfast Gardner|Hamfast]], [[Daisy Gardner|Daisy]], [[Primrose Gardner|Primrose]], [[Bilbo Gardner|Bilbo]], [[Ruby Gardner|Ruby]], [[Robin Gardner|Robin]], and [[Tolman Gardner|Tolman]]. When Frodo sailed on the [[White Ship]], at the end of the Third Age, Sam inherited Bag End and was entrusted the [[Red Book of Westmarch]].

After [[Will Whitfoot]] resigned his post as [[Mayor of Michel Delving]] (the largest town in the Shire and the "unofficial capital"), in {{FoA|6}}, Sam was elected Mayor of the Shire, that would be the first of seven consecutive 7-year terms.<ref name=later/> Soon after his election he established a rule of succession and inheritance in situations such as the headless [[Baggins family]], since Bilbo and Frodo went over the sea and was impossible to presume death.<ref>{{L|214}}</ref> During his service, King Elessar appointed the Mayor as a [[Counsellor of the North-kingdom]]. In {{SR|1436}} he met King Elessar on the [[Brandywine Bridge]] and was awarded the [[Star of the Dúnedain]]. In {{SR|1442}} he left [[Tolman Cotton Junior]] as deputy Mayor so that he rode to Gondor with his wife and his daughter Elanor, maid of honour to Queen Arwen, to spend a year there. When Elanor married [[Fastred of Greenholm]], he requested from Thain Peregrin to make him [[Warden of Westmarch]] in {{SR|1462}}.<ref name=later>{{App|Later}}</ref>

After his wife died in {{FoA|61}}, on [[22 September]] Sam left Bag End, and went to the [[Tower Hills]] where he was last seen by Elanor, entrusting to her the Red Book; according to her, he went to the [[Grey Havens]] to sail across the Sea<ref name=later/> and be reunited with Frodo in the [[Undying Lands]].

==Characteristics==
Sam has brown eyes. At some points his hands are described as brown.<ref name="TT|Stairs"/><ref>{{RK|Tower}}</ref>
This could indicate he belongs to the [[Harfoots]], as they are described as having browner skin than the [[Fallohides]], to which breed Merry, Pippin and Frodo belong.<ref>{{FR|Hobbits}}</ref> Or it could simply be a tan from years of working outside. His face is often described as red-faced, turning scarlet or blushing. At one point his face is said to have turned white, before flushing scarlet.

Sam was a representative hobbit. He was vulgar and cocksure, but his devotion to Frodo moderated his conceit. For him, his service and loyalty was the measure of his heroicism and bravery.<ref>{{L|246}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Samwise'' means "simple minded" or "half-minded". ''Gamgee'' is explained as a corruption of the name ''[[Gammidgy]]'', a village in the Shire. Both names are presented as translations of the [[Westron]] form of Sam's name '''[[Banazîr]] Galpsi''' (from the complete form [[Galbasi]]) (q.v. for more information).<ref>{{App|Translation}}</ref>

Tolkien's English translation, ''Samwís Gamwich'', could have come to ''Samwise Gamgee'' in modern English.

The [[Sindarin]] version of Samwise is '''''[[Perhael]]'''''. In the [[King's Letter]], contained in the unpublished "[[Epilogue]]", King Elessar refers to Sam as ''Perhael (i sennui Panthael estathar aen)'', Sindarin for "Halfwise (who should rather be called Fullwise)."

==Inspiration==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] took the name from ''Gamgee Tissue'', a surgical dressing invented by a 19th century [[Birmingham]] surgeon called Joseph Sampson Gamgee. "Gamgee" became the colloquial name in Birmingham for cotton wool. Here, Tolkien describes why he had chosen that name for his character:
{{blockquote|The choice of Gamgee was primarily directed by alliteration, but I did not invent it. It was caught out of childhood memory, as a comic word or name. It was in fact the name when I was small (in Birmingham) for 'cotton-wool'. (Hence the association of the Gamgees with the Cottons.) I knew nothing of its origin.|''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]:'' [[Letter 257]]}}

It is possible that Tolkien may have subconsciously recalled Dr. Gamgee (who died in 1886 but is commemorated by a plaque at the Birmingham Medical Institute, only yards from Tolkien's childhood home) but he claimed to be genuinely surprised when, in March 1956, he received a letter from one Sam Gamgee, who had heard that his name was in ''The Lord of the Rings'' but had not read the book. Tolkien replied on March 18:
{{blockquote|Dear Mr. Gamgee,<p>It was very kind of you to write. You can imagine my astonishment when I saw your signature! I can only say, for your comfort, I hope, that the 'Sam Gamgee' of my story is a most heroic character, now widely beloved by many readers, even though his origins are rustic. So that perhaps you will not be displeased at the coincidence of the name of this imaginary character of supposedly many centuries ago being the same as yours.|''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]:'' [[Letter 184]]}}

He proceeded to send Mr Gamgee a signed copy of all three volumes of the book. However, the incident sparked a nagging worry in Tolkien's mind, as he recorded in his journal: 
{{blockquote|For some time I lived in fear of receiving a letter signed 'S. Gollum'. That would have been more difficult to deal with.|''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]''}}

==Commentary==
In one of his letters, Tolkien described Sam is  as the "chief hero" and placed special emphasis on his "rustic love" for Rosie.<ref>{{L|131}}</ref> He was known for rescuing Frodo at [[Cirith Ungol]], and carrying him up [[Mount Doom]]. He was one of only two Ring-bearers strong enough to surrender the Ring voluntarily.

The relationship between Frodo and Sam is, in many respects, at the centre of ''The Lord of the Rings''.  Sam's humbleness and plain speaking are frequently emphasised in contrast to Frodo's gentility, and he often shows deference to Frodo, calling him "Mister Frodo" or "Master".  At the same time, a strong bond of love and trust grows between them, portrayed most poignantly during the events of Cirith Ungol, where Sam vows to return to his (apparently) dead master, to be reunited with Frodo in death. 

[[Tolkienists]] regard Sam as Frodo's ''[[wikipedia:Batman (army)|batman]]''. In the British Army, a batman was an orderly who acted as the personal servant of an officer. It was a role with which Tolkien (who served as an Army officer in the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I First World War]) would have been extremely familiar. Sam undertakes all of the typical roles of a batman &mdash; he runs errands for Frodo, cooks, transports him (or at least carries him), and carries his luggage. Tolkien confirmed this interpretation when he wrote in a private letter that:
{{blockquote|My Sam Gamgee is indeed a reflection of the English soldier, of the privates and batmen I knew in the 1914 war, and recognized as so far superior to myself|''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]''}}

This may be compared to the relationship between [[wikipedia:Don Quixote|Don Quixote]] and his squire, [[wikipedia:Sancho Panza|Sancho Panza]], and the gradual "Quixotization" of Sancho.

==In other stories==
In the illustrated short story ''[[Mr. Bliss]]'', the local police officer is a Sergeant [[Boffin Family|Boffin]] who - at the behest of [[Gaffer Gamgee]] - seeks to lock up Mr Bliss as a thief for failing to pay for his car. Sergeant Boffin also has a son named Sam.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[Mr. Bliss]]'' (2011 edition), p. 62</ref>

After Gandalf tells Frodo of the powers of [[The One Ring|Bilbo's ring]], Merry, Pippin and Sam decide to accompany Frodo to [[Rivendell]]. They set off, pursued by [[Nazgûl|Black Riders.]] Later, they encounter a group of dancing [[Elves]]. They camp with the Elves and share food, an experience which becomes, in Sam's memory, one of the chief events in his life. Continuing on, they arrive in the [[Old Forest]] and stop for a rest. Pippin is trapped in the [[Old Man Willow]] and Frodo and Sam attempt to help him out. Their efforts are futile until helped by a wandering [[Tom Bombadil]]. The group arrive at [[Bree]] and enter ''[[Prancing Pony|Prancing Pony Inn]]''. They meet with a man named Strider. A letter from Gandalf reveals that his real name is [[Aragorn]] and the Hobbits follow him, as he knows a better route to Rivendell. They arrive in Rivendell and wait for Frodo, who is comatosed for 4 days due to his encounter with the Black Riders. The soon-to-be members of the [[Council of Elrond]] hold a celebratory feast after Frodo recovers. The Council convenes and they decide to form a [[Fellowship of the Ring]], comprising the previous members of their band, Gandalf, [[Legolas]] and [[Gimli]], to take the ring to [[Mordor]] and destroy it. As they prepare, Sam checks and re-checks his pack to ensure no supplies are missing. He is dismayed by the lack of rope, remembering that he had thought previously about how rope could be useful. The Fellowship depart and take a final look at the House of Elrond. The group sets off, Sam behind Frodo.

:The voice of Samwise Gamgee is provided by Stano Dančiak. Dančiak, though a slightly older actor than the other actors portraying the four hobbits, was well-known for his convincing "smart everyman" roles. This is utilised in the series to emphasize that Sam comes from a more ordinary family and humbler social standing than Frodo, Pippin and Merry. Sam is portrayed as resourceful, honest, loyal, caring, and capable of finding bravery when he least expects it. He is also very curious about the world outside of The Shire, including Elven and Dwarven culture and lore. He is addressed almost entirely by his abbreviated name, Sam.

:Sam is played by [[Sean Astin]]. [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]] majorly diverges Sam and Frodo's story. Frodo, manipulated by Gollum and the One Ring, abandons Sam in Mordor after he offers to carry the Ring. Frodo faces Shelob alone and Sam comes to his rescue after he has already been bound by her webs.

A series of a session plays depicts Sam, Frodo and Gollum's journey through the [[Dead Marshes]], the Pass of [[Cirith Ungol]] and [[Mordor]]. The player later meets Sam and Frodo again at the [[Field of Cormallen]].

:The game's "Guardian" class ("Tank" in MMO terms) is based on Samwise due to the dedication he showed Frodo. Samwise insists that he is no Guardian and not fit to be one - because his heroic deeds have not happened yet. The player has to double-check and discovers that whoever talked of Sam as a great Guardian, apparently had misheard the word "Gardener".

'''2010: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest]]'':'''
:Samwise appears in the game as a non-playable character, with [[Sean Astin]] reprising his role. He narrates the story of Aragorn to his children when the latter is to come to the Shire.
