'''Prisca Bolger, née Baggins''', was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of [[the Shire]].

==History==
Prisca was the second child and daughter of [[Polo Baggins]].<ref>{{App|Baggins}}</ref> She married [[Wilibald Bolger]], and had several children: [[Wilimar Bolger|Wilimar]], [[Heribald Bolger|Heribald]] and [[Nora Bolger|Nora]]. Her husband passed away before {{SR|1401}}, but she attended [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]] with her children.<ref>{{App|Bolger|50}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Prisca'' is a Latin/Italian word meaning "former, old" from which derives the name [[Priscilla Tolkien|Priscilla]].<ref>http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Priscilla</ref>
==Other versions of the legendarium==
[[The Lord of the Rings (50th Anniversary Edition)|The 50th Anniversary edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'']] includes Prisca as a guest at the Farewell Party.<ref>{{App|Baggins|50}}</ref> In older editions of [[Appendix C]], Prisca is not marked as an attendee. [[Robert Foster]] in his ''[[The Complete Guide to Middle-earth]]'' thus states that Prisca died ''before'' {{TA|3001}}.<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Prisca Baggins"</ref>
