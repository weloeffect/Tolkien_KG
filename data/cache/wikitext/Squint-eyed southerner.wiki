The '''squint-eyed southerner''' was a brigand driven from [[Dunland]], rumored to have a strain of [[Orcs|Orc]]-blood in him. He initially acted as one of the corrupted [[Wizards|Wizard]] [[Saruman]]'s most trusted agents, before being compelled into the service of the [[Nazgûl]] as an informant.

== History ==
Hailing from Dunland, the squint-eyed southerner was banished by his fellow [[Dunlendings|hillmen]] due to a rumor that he had Orc-blood coursing through his veins (implying he may have been one of the [[Half-orcs]] or [[Goblin-men]]).<ref name="UT10">{{UT|10}}, "Concerning Gandalf, Saruman, and the Shire"</ref>

Having entered the employ of the Wizard Saruman, the southerner was at one point stationed on the borders of [[the Shire]] to negotiate the purchase of "[[pipe-weed|leaf]]" and other supplies which were stored in [[Isengard]] in preparation for the [[War of the Ring|war]]. The squint-eyed southerner had been instructed by his master to infiltrate the Shire and learn of any [[Hobbits]] who had departed recently in hopes of finding the [[Ring-bearer]]. The southerner was well supplied with maps, lists of names, and notes concerning the Shire.

In September of {{TA|3018}}, the Dunlending was traveling back to the Shire when the black-robed [[Nazgûl]] came upon him at the [[Tharbad]] crossing. When questioned, the southerner told the [[Witch-king]] everything, betraying the White Wizard; this proved Saruman was withholding information from his own master, [[Sauron]]. The Lord of [[Minas Morgul|Morgul]] was made aware of the name [[Baggins Family|Baggins]] and [[Hobbiton]] was singled out for immediate visit and inquiry.

The Witch-king put the [[Shadow]] of Fear on the southerner and sent him to [[Bree]] as a spy, warning him he now answered to the [[Eye of Sauron|Red Eye]] and not the [[White Hand]]. The Dunlending met up with [[Bill Ferny]] and at the [[Prancing Pony]] on [[September 29]]th, the two of them saw [[Frodo Baggins]] vanish into thin air. After reporting the information to the Nazgûl, the Nine Black Riders came to attack that night.<ref name="UT10"/>

Aragorn kept the Hobbits safe through the night. The next morning, the squint-eyed southerner was spotted inside Bill Ferny's house when the company set out to [[Weathertop]].<ref name="FRI11">{{FR|I11}}</ref>

Nothing else is recorded of the squint-eyed southerner. However in {{TA|3019|n}}, a large number of [[Ruffians]] occupied the Shire and oppressed the Hobbits.<ref>{{HM|RK}}, "[[The Scouring of the Shire]]"</ref> It is possible the southerner was among them as many of Saruman's agents there resembled him. The Men were driven out of the Shire in the [[Battle of Bywater]] on November 3.

== Description ==
{{quote|Just what my father meant to convey by the 'squint-eyed Southerner' at Bree I'm not sure. I don't think that he can possibly have meant that the man had 'slit-eyes' (goblin-like). He may have meant that he actually had a squint (optical disorder), but that seems unnecessarily particular. So the likeliest meaning, I think, is that the man didn't look straight, but obliquely, watchfully, sideways, suggesting craftiness and crookedness.|[[Christopher Tolkien]]<ref>"The Squint-eyed Southerner", ''[[Beyond Bree]]'', May [[1990]], p. 9</ref>}}

'''2001-2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'':'''
:A Decipher card identifies one of the Men at [[Bree]] in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' as the '''Squint-eyed Southerner'''.

'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''
: A character called '''The Southerner''' (loosely based on the novel character) attempts to talk Harley Bramble into joining with a gang of outlaws. After Bramble is convinced not to by [[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]], [[Andriel]] and [[Farin (video game character)|Farin]], the Southerner threatens that his "[[Mordor|powerful]] [[Isengard|friends]]" will trouble the trio. If the player returns to Bree after the mission to [[Mount Gundabad]], it will be revealed that Ruffians have attacked the town but have been defeated, with Bramble claiming he himself made sure the Southerner will trouble Bree-folk no more.

'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]:'''
:A character credited as '''Squint''' appears in the prologue in Bree. Along with another character credited as "Bill Ferny Sr." (loosely based on Bill Ferny), Squint has seemingly tracked [[Thorin]] to the Prancing Pony (presumably to collect on the bounty put out on Thorin's head). The two Men are preparing to confront Thorin when [[Gandalf]] goes over and sits and starts talking with the [[Dwarves|Dwarf]]. When it becomes apparent the [[Wizards|Wizard]] is not going anywhere, Bill and Squint get up and leave the inn.
