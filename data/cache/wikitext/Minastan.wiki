'''Minastan''' was the second son of King [[Minardil]] of [[Gondor]]. 

==History==
In {{TA|1636}}<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> Minastan's elder brother [[Telemnar]] had sat on their father's throne for just two years when he died with all his heirs in the [[Great Plague]].<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>  Minastan had also died by this time - perhaps he too met his end in the Plague - but he left behind a surviving heir, [[Tarondor (King of Gondor)|Tarondor]], who became the first King of a new line.<ref>{{App|South}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Minastan'' is [[Quenya]]. Its meaning is not glossed, but as Paul Strack explains, it might mean "Smith of the Tower" and be a compound of a shortened form ''minas'' of [[minasse]] ("tower") and the suffixal form ''-tan'' of [[tamo]] ("smith, builder").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-96627655.html|articlename=Q.
