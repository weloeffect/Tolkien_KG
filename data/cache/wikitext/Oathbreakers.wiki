The '''Oathbreakers''', also known as the '''Dead Men of Dunharrow''', were a [[Pre-Númenóreans|Pre-Númenórean]] people, originally settling in the [[White Mountains]] who were cursed by [[Isildur]] to not find rest until they fulfilled their oath of allegiance to Isildur and to fight against [[Sauron]].

==History==
They were originally known by the [[Númenóreans]] as the '''Men of the Mountains'''.<ref name=Company>{{RK|Company}}, p. 782</ref> They were a [[Pre-Númenóreans|Pre-Númenórean]] people that lived in the [[White Mountains]] during the [[Second Age]] and were related to the [[Dunlendings]]<ref name=Men>{{App|Men}}, p. 1129</ref> and to the [[House of Haleth|folk of Haleth]].<ref>{{PM|Atani}}</ref> They had worshipped [[Sauron]] in the [[Dark Years]] before the foundation of [[Gondor]].<ref name=Company/>

After Gondor was founded in the last years of the [[Second Age]], [[King of the Dead|their King]] swore allegiance to [[Isildur]] at the [[Stone of Erech]] on the Hill of [[Erech]]. When Sauron returned and grew in might, Isildur commanded the Men of the Mountains to fulfil their oath and fight beside Isildur against their ancient master, they broke their oath and refused to join the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|Last Alliance]]. As a reaction Isildur cursed them to remain without rest until their oath was fulfilled and foretold them that the war against Sauron would last for years uncounted and that they would be summoned again before the end. The Men of the Mountains fled from the wrath of Isildur and hid in secret places in the mountains, had no contact with other men and slowly dwindled. Afterwards the [[wraiths]]<ref>{{RK|Debate}}, p. 876</ref> of the Sleepless Dead spread terror around the Hill of Erech and all places where the Men of the Mountains had lingered.<ref name=Company/>

The Dead Men haunted the [[Paths of the Dead|caverns]] beneath the [[Dwimorberg]] and their wraiths appeared in the valley of [[Harrowdale]] that lay in the mountain's shadow in times of trouble and coming death and caused the local people to lock themselves in their houses in fear.<ref>{{RK|Muster}}, p. 797</ref> The wraiths of the dead also filled the population near the hill of Erech with fear, who knew that the host of the wraiths was led by the [[King of the Dead]].<ref name=Dead>{{RK|Company}}, p. 789</ref>

During the [[War of the Ring]], Isildur's Heir, [[Aragorn]], commanded the Dead to let him and his company pass and to come to the Stone of Erech when he encountered them in the Paths of the Dead. The Dead followed him through the Paths of the Dead and the [[Blackroot Vale]] south of the White Mountains to the Stone of Erech. There Aragorn commanded the Oathbreakers to follow him to [[Pelargir]] and announced that he would hold the oath fulfilled when all the servants of Sauron have been removed from this land.<ref>{{RK|Company}}, pp. 787-789</ref> The Dead fulfilled their oath and drove away the allies of Sauron through fear at the fords over the river [[Gilrain]] at [[Linhir]] and at [[Pelargir]]. In return for their aid, at the shore of the river [[Anduin]] at Pelargir, Aragorn held their oath as fulfilled, commanded them to never again trouble the valleys, to depart and to be at rest.<ref>{{RK|Debate}}, pp. 874-876</ref>

==Other names==
Before breaking their oath, these men were known simply as the '''Men of the Mountains'''.<ref name=Company/> Afterwards, they were referred to as the '''Dead Men of Dunharrow''',<ref name=Men/> the '''Sleepless Dead'''<ref name=Company/> or just the '''Dead''',<ref name=Dead/> the '''Grey Host''',<ref>{{RK|Debate}}, p. 875</ref> the '''Shadow Host''',<ref name=Shadows>{{RK|Company}}, p. 790</ref> the '''Shadow-men'''<ref name=Dead/> or simply the '''[[Shadow]]s'''.<ref name=Shadows/>

The name "Army of the Dead" was only used in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]].

==Portrayal in adaptations==

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:The Dead were originally envisioned as walking skeletons, but this had to be revised after ''Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl'' came out and portrayed a similar idea with its undead hosts. The Dead were instead shown as glowing green ghosts. Contrary to the book, the Dead follow [[Aragorn]] all the way to [[Minas Tirith]], and destroy [[Sauron]]'s troops. It is after this that they are ultimately set free.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The Oathbreakers of Dunharrow are the inspiration for several other factions of Oathbreakers and other cursed shades, such as former soldiers of [[Arthedain]] cursed for betraying [[Fornost]] to the forces of [[Angmar]]. The King of the Dead was named Rioc. Some of the Dead Men of Dunharrow refused to follow Aragorn, and reaffirmed their allegiance to Sauron. These were known as the Ruthless Dead.
