'''Isengrim Took III''' was the twenty-seventh [[Thain|Thain of the Shire]].
==History==
The eldest son of the [[Gerontius Took|Old Took]], Isengrim's rule was noticeably short. Due to his father's longevity, he was already near his nineties when he became [[Thain]], and ruled for ten years before his death. As he had no children of his own, his brother [[Isumbras Took IV|Isumbras]] became the new Thain.<ref>{{App|Took}}</ref>

==Etymology==
"Isengrim" is of [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] origin and comes from ''isen'' meaning "iron" and ''grim'' meaning "fierce".

It is likely Isengrim is named after an earlier [[Isengrim (disambiguation)|Isengrim]], but it is notable that "Isengrim" is the name of a wolf who appears in many medieval epics, including the story of [[Wikipedia:Reynard the Fox|Reynard the Fox]] which originated in French folklore.<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 760</ref>
