'''Barad Nimras''' was a tower on a headland westward of [[Eglarest]],<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref> built by [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] in {{FA|65}}.<ref>{{GA|90}}</ref> 

Its purpose was to watch the western seas, and warn of any naval attack by [[Morgoth]]'s forces. As Morgoth never mounted any attack from the ocean, the tower was never in fact needed.<ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref>

However, in the year after the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]],<ref>{{GA|254}}</ref> Morgoth did launch [[Fall of the Falas|a land-based attack]] on [[Eglarest]] and [[Brithombar]], and Barad Nimras was torn down at that time by the very foes it was meant to guard against.<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Barad Nimras'' is [[Sindarin]] for "Tower of the White Horn",<ref>{{S|Index}}, entry "Barad Nimras"</ref> from ''[[barad]]'' ("tower"), ''[[nimp]]'' ("white") + ''[[ras]]'' ("horn"). It may be a reference to the tower itself, or perhaps to the narrow cape on which it stood.
