==Etymology==
The meaning of the name ''Seredic'' is unknown. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] noted that the names of the Bucklanders had a vaguely [[Celtic]] style.<ref name="Translation">{{App|Translation}}, p. 1135</ref>

In an earlier version of the family tree for the [[Brandybucks]], the name of Seredic was '''''Ceredic'''''.<ref>{{PM|Trees}}, Brandybuck of Buckland, BR 5</ref>

''Ceredic'' is a real [[Welsh]] name and a variant of the name ''Caradoc''. ''[[Wikipedia:Ceredig|Ceredic Guletic]]'' was the son of ''Cunedag Guletic'', a chief from the fifth century who drove the Goidels/Gaels from North Wales. ''Ceredic Guletic'' ruled a region that was named ''Ceredigion'' after him in Welsh and Cardiganshire in English.<ref name="Allan">{{HM|IE}}, "Giving of Names", p. 205</ref>
