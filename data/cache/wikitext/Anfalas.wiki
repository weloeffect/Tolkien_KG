'''Anfalas''', or '''Langstrand''', was a coastal fief<ref>{{HM|UI}}, entry ''Gondor'', p. 17</ref> between the rivers [[Lefnui]] and [[Morthond]] south of the [[Pinnath Gelin]] in the southwest of [[Gondor]].<ref>{{FR|Map}}</ref>

==History==
It is not known when Anfalas became a part of the kingdom of Gondor. It is possible that it became a part of Gondor when king [[Tarannon Falastur]] extended the borders of Gondor along the coasts west of the [[Ethir Anduin]].<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Tarannon, p. 1044</ref>

During the reign of King [[Telumehtar Umbardacil|Telumehtar]] the [[Corsairs of Umbar]] raided the coasts of Gondor as far as the Anfalas. As a consequence, King Telumehtar assembled his troops, conquered Umbar by storm<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Telumehtar, p. 1048</ref> in {{TA|1810}} and drove out the Corsairs.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1810, p. 1086</ref>

During the [[War of the Ring]] [[Golasgil]], the lord of Anfalas, led a long line of men of many sorts from Anfalas, hunters, herdsmen and men from little villages, which except the men of his household were scantily equipped from Anfalas to defend [[Minas Tirith]] in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]].<ref>{{RK|MT}}, p. 770</ref>
