{{Quote|I'll give you Sharkey, you dirty thieving ruffians!|Lobelia Sackville-Baggins in ''[[The Return of the King]]'', "[[The Scouring of the Shire]]"}}
'''Lobelia Sackville-Baggins''', (née '''[[Bracegirdle Family|Bracegirdle]]''') was the second child, and only daughter of [[Primrose Bracegirdle|Primrose Boffin]] and [[Blanco Bracegirdle]] and then the wife of [[Otho Sackville-Baggins]], a distant relative of [[Bilbo Baggins]], known for her want of the hobbit-hole [[Bag End]].

==History==
Lobelia was born in [[Hardbottle]] to [[Primrose Bracegirdle|Primrose Boffin]] and [[Blanco Bracegirdle]] and the sister of [[Bruno Bracegirdle]]. Lobelia was renowned in the [[The Shire]] for her temper and greed. She later married [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s cousin [[Otho Sackville-Baggins]], and they had one child together, [[Lotho Sackville-Baggins|Lotho]], who was born in {{SR|1364}}.<ref name="Bag">{{App|Baggins}}</ref>

Her envy of [[Bag End]] was well-known; when Bilbo left for [[Quest for Erebor|his legendary journey]] in {{SR|1341}}<ref name="Return">{{H|Return}}</ref> she coveted Bag End and found an oportunity to steal some of Bilbo's spoons, as Bilbo suspected after his return, and Lobelia knew well his suspicions. Lobelia and Otho were furious when Bilbo made [[Frodo Baggins]] his heir, him being a more distant relative. However, he did invite them to [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|his farewell feast]], with magnificent invitations written with golden ink; Lobelia could not ignore it. The [[23 September|next day]] she and Otho came to Bag End, hearing that Bilbo's household was being given out, but Frodo said that what was directed to her was only a case of silver spoons. She took "the point", and took the gift. But later as Otho left, she was still there, investigating nooks and corners and tapping the floors, she had snatched some small valuable things in her umbrella, until Frodo relieved her and drove her out, as she shouted that he should also leave, being half [[Brandybuck Family|Brandybuck]], did not belong here. [[Gandalf]] later saw her driving a pony-trap towards [[Bywater]].<ref>{{FR|Party}}</ref>

Her angry words to Frodo turned out to be true: he decided to leave for [[Crickhollow]] (a ruse to escape the Shire) he sold Bag End to Lobelia by [[June]] {{TA|3018}}, but unfortunately Lobelia was now centennial, and Otho had died by then. The titles would pass to her on [[24 September]], but she went there [[23 September|the previous day]] with Lotho, and an inventory list to inspect that nothing she had paid for had been carried off to Buckland. She went right though her list, and in the end they departed with the spare key; Frodo said that his own would be left with the [[Gamgee Family]] and Lobelia reacted as if she thought that the Gamgees would rob the household the next day.<ref name="Company">{{FR|I3}}</ref> 
[[File:Miriam Ellis - Lobelia rescued from the Lockholes.png|thumb|200px|left|"Lobelia rescued from [[Lockholes|the Lockholes]]" by [[Miriam Ellis]]]]
During the [[War of the Ring]], Lobelia was imprisoned in [[Lockholes]] for arguing with the [[Chief Shirriff|Chief]]'s Men, and attacking one of them with an umbrella.<ref name="Scouring">{{RK|Scouring}}</ref> After finding [[Fredegar Bolger]], Frodo finds Lobelia, old and frail. As Frodo lets her out, Lobelia was popular for the first time for bravely standing up to the [[Saruman]]'s [[Ruffians|Men]], receiving cheers and applauds. However, she was crushed to find out her son had been murdered whilst she was in prison. After the War of the Ring, Lobelia returned to her home village to live with the other [[Bracegirdle Family|Bracegirdle]]s, giving Bag End to Frodo. When she died in the Spring of {{TA|3020}}, she gave her money to Frodo to be used to help [[hobbits]] left homeless by Saruman and her son, which deeply moved Frodo.<ref name="Grey">{{RK|Havens}}</ref>
