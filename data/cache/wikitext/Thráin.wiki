'''Thráin II''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2644|n}} – {{TA|2850|n}}, aged 206 years) was King of [[Durin's Folk]] for 60 years, from {{TA|2790}} to {{TA|2850|n}}, during their exile from [[Lonely Mountain]]. He was the son of [[Thrór]] and father of [[Thorin|Thorin II]], [[Frerin]], and [[Dís]]. Thorin II would later be known as [[Thorin|Thorin Oakenshield]].<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref>

== History ==
Thráin fled with his father and a small group of companions when the [[Dragons|dragon]] [[Smaug]] in {{TA|2770}} descended on Lonely Mountain and sacked the [[Dwarves|Dwarven]] kingdom. King Thrór, Thráin, and the others eventually settled in [[Dunland]] and scratched out a meager living. Thrór was devastated by the loss of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] and left his people to journey north. He took a single companion, [[Nár]], but left his son with his [[Ring of Thrór|Ring of Power]], along with the [[Thrór's Map|map]] and key to Lonely Mountain.
 
In {{TA|2790}}<ref name="TA">{{App|TA}}</ref> Nár returned to tell Thráin that his father had been captured and butchered by the [[Orcs|Orc]]-chieftain [[Azog]] when they had journeyed to the mines of [[Moria]]. Even worse, Azog had beheaded Thrór and carved his own name on Thrór's forehead to show the Dwarves that an Orc now ruled their ancestral home.

Thráin sat for seven days without speaking, until he stood and said "This cannot be borne!".<ref name="Durin"/> 

=== War of the Dwarves and Orcs ===
Filled with righteous anger, by {{TA|2793}}<ref name="TA"/> Thráin had gathered together a massive army of Dwarves to wage the [[War of the Dwarves and Orcs]]. The army included the exiles of the Lonely Mountain, Thráin's [[Dwarves of the Iron Hills|kin]] from the [[Iron Hills]] under his uncle [[Grór]], and even some Dwarves not of Durin's folk. One by one they assaulted the Orc-holds of the [[Misty Mountains]], destroying their great warrens in [[Gundabad|Mount Gundabad]] and eventually facing Azog himself in [[Dimrill Dale]] (''Azanulbizar'' in [[Khuzdul]]) before the [[Great Gates|East-gate of Moria]]. 

In {{TA|2799}}<ref name="TA"/> Thráin and his army fought the bloody [[Battle of Azanulbizar]]. Thráin was blinded in one eye and suffered a leg-wound. While the Orcs were vanquished and Azog slain, the Dwarves took heavy losses, including Thráin's son Frerin, his cousin [[Náin son of Grór|Náin]], and [[Fundin]] father of Dwarven hero [[Balin]]. 

King Thráin II wanted to enter Moria and reclaim it, but the Dwarves not of Durin's folk refused, saying that the city was not their Fathers' House; they had honoured Thrór's memory by fighting, and this was enough. [[Dáin Ironfoot]] had peered within the [[Great Gates|East-gate]] and also warned Thráin that [[Durin's Bane]] still dwelt within Khazad-dûm.<ref name="Durin"/>

=== Wanderings and imprisonment ===
After the war, Thráin and Thorin led the exiles of Lonely Mountain west to live in the southern [[Blue Mountains]] where they settled in {{TA|2802}}.<ref name="TA"/> Over the next forty years Thráin grew increasingly consumed with the lost riches of the Lonely Mountain. This may have been partly because of the [[Ring of Thrór]]. 

In {{TA|2841}}<ref name="TA"/> he left the Blue Mountains with a small group that included [[Balin]] and [[Dwalin]]. Travelling east, the group was constantly harassed by wolves, Orcs, and other fell creatures. In {{TA|2845|n}},<ref name="TA"/> while camped under the eaves of [[Mirkwood]], Thráin disappeared and would never be seen again by his kin. The King of Durin's folk had been captured by Sauron's agents and was taken to the fortress of [[Dol Guldur]] in southern Mirkwood. There Sauron tortured Thráin, took back the last of the [[Seven Rings|seven Dwarf-rings]], and left him in the dungeon to die.

In {{TA|2850}},<ref name="TA"/> while on a reconnaissance mission to Dol Guldur, [[Gandalf]] came upon Thráin, who was so diminished that he could not even remember his own name. Thráin gave Gandalf his last two possessions, the key and map to the Lonely Mountain, and shortly thereafter died. Gandalf left him without knowing who he was.<ref name="Durin"/>

===Legacy===
Much later Gandalf met Thorin Oakenshield near [[Bree]] and realized that the Dwarf he had found in Dol Guldur was Thráin, the vanished King of Durin's folk. Gandalf and Thorin discussed reclaiming Lonely Mountain, and Gandalf gave much assistance to [[Thorin and Company]], including the map and key to Lonely Mountain, along with a suggestion that they include a [[Bilbo Baggins|burglar]] in their quest.<ref name="Durin"/>

Gandalf mentioned to the Fellowship, as they were debating about going into Moria, that he had been in the mines before looking for Thráin.<ref>{{FR|II4}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Þráinn'' is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. It means "Stubborn".<ref name="IE">{{HM|IE}}, "Giving of Names", p. 223</ref><ref>Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref> [[Jim Allan]] noted that ''Thráin'' went stubbornly off to Erebor again.<ref name="IE"/>

'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:'''
: The young Thráin  during the Dwarves' reign at [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] is portrayed by [[Thomas Robins]] in ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]''.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.theonering.net/torwp/2013/09/17/79224-actor-thomas-robins-deagol-and-young-thrain-talks-to-torn/|articlename=Actor Thomas Robins (Deagol and Young Thrain) talks to TORn|dated=17 September 2013|website=TORN|accessed=18 September 2013}}</ref>  During the scenes from the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] in the same film, he is allegedly played by [[Mike Mizrahi]],<ref name="PJCasting">{{webcite|author=[[Peter Jackson]]|articleurl=http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150168211921558|articlename=Production begins in New Zealand on The Hobbit|dated=20-March-2011|website=[http://www.facebook.com/ Facebook]|accessed=23-Dec-2011}}</ref> though no footage seems to appear of him in the Theatrical Version of the films. Finally, in the [[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (extended edition)|Extended Edition]] of ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'', he is portrayed by [[Antony Sher]] at old age in Dol Guldur, and by Mike Mizrahi at young age, during the Battle of Azanulbizar.

'''2013: ''[[The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug]]'':'''
:In the Extended Edition of this film, Thráin Is first seen in a flashback to the Battle of Azanulbizar during the prologue while [[Gandalf]] and [[Thorin]] discuss his possible whereabouts. In this flashback, Thráin insists Thorin stay back as he leads a charge toward the [[Great Gates]] (though he is not seen again during the battle or its aftermath).

:Old and delirious, Thráin is again seen later at [[Dol Guldur]] when Gandalf arrives to investigate. He tracks the [[Wizards|Wizard]], and ultimately attacks him in a fit of madness. Gandalf is able to overtake him and calm him. Thráin warns Gandalf to not let Thorin near the [[Lonely Mountain]] because he has learned that [[Smaug]] is in league with [[Sauron|The One]]. He ultimately helps Gandalf navigate through the fortress before [[Azog]] and several other [[Orcs]] attack. The two of them try to escape but are eventually stopped by the shadow of the [[Sauron#Sauron's Return|Necromancer]]. Thráin tells Gandalf to tell Thorin that he loved him, and is swallowed up the shadow, which then reveals itself as [[Sauron]] to Gandalf.

'''2013: ''[[Guardians of Middle-earth]]'':'''
:Thráin is a warrior-type "guardian" with four abilities: ''Hammer throw'', ''Dwarven valor'', ''Lethal blow'' and ''Durin's Wrath''.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.guardiansofmiddleearth.co.uk/guardians/thrain-ii|articlename=''Guardians of Middle-earth'': Thráin|dated=|website=[http://www.guardiansofmiddleearth.com/ ''Guardians of Middle-earth'' official website]|accessed=16 July 2012}}</ref>

'''2021: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Thráin appears in an extended flashback depicting the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]], which closely follows the description given in the books.
