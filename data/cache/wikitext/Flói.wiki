'''Flói''' was a [[Dwarves|dwarf]] of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]].

==History==
Flói was a member of [[Balin's folk]] who tried to reclaim [[Moria]] in {{TA|2989}}.  When they reached the [[Mirrormere]], there was a great battle. Flói was valorous and killed the great chieftain, but was killed by a [[Goblin]] arrow.<ref>[[Book of Mazarbul]] records "Flói was killed by an arrow. He slew the great [...] Flói under grass near Mirror mere"; {{FR|Bridge}}</ref>  

Although against the Dwarven traditions,<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref> he was buried under the grass near the Mirrormere. His death was recorded in the [[Book of Mazarbul]].<ref>{{FR|Bridge}}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[Jim Allan]] suggests that the name ''Flói'' could be connected with the Old Norse verb ''flóa'' ("to boil", "to flood") and that the Old Norse word ''Flói'' means "marshy moor", "bay" or "large firth".<ref>{{HM|IE}}, "Giving of Names", p. 224</ref>
