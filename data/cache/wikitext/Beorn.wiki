'''Beorn''' was a [[Skin-changers|Skin-changer]], a man who could assume the form of a huge black [[bears|bear]]. He aided [[Thorin and Company]] during their [[Quest of Erebor]].

==History==
[[File:Jef Murray - At the Carrock.jpg|[[Jef Murray]] - ''At the Carrock''|thumb|left]]
His origins lay in the distant past, and [[Gandalf]] suspected he and his people had originally come from [[Misty Mountains|the mountains]], until the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] drove them away. He lived with his tame [[horses]] in a [[Beorn's Hall|wooden house]] between the [[Anduin|Great River]] and [[Mirkwood]].

Beorn named stone eyots in the Great River "carrocks"; the one closer to his home he named "the [[Carrock]]" and created some steps that led from its base to the flat top. While Gandalf knew him, Beorn did not know Gandalf; but he knew his fellow wizard, [[Radagast]]. Once Gandalf saw him as a huge black bear sitting all alone on the top of the Carrock watching the moon sinking towards the Misty Mountains, and heard him growl in the tongue of bears "The day will come when [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains|they]] will perish and I shall go back!".<ref name="Queer" />

During the [[Quest of Erebor]], Beorn received Gandalf, [[Bilbo Baggins]] and the thirteen [[Dwarves]] and gave the Dwarves and Bilbo help in their quest. As Gandalf knew that he disliked guests, he presented the dwarves gradually, while narrating his adventures in an exciting way. Beorn agreed to host them and provided them [[ponies]] until they reached the Mirkwood. To be sure about his ponies, Beorn stalked the company in the form of a bear, seen by Gandalf and Bilbo, and before Gandalf left them, insisted that the Dwarves should leave the ponies behind, as promised, as they had been always under their master's watch.<ref name="Queer" />

Beorn heard news of the [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Smaug]]'s death in [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]].<ref name = "H14">{{H|14}}</ref>

In the [[Battle of Five Armies]], Beorn appeared transformed into a giant black bear, rescued [[Thorin]] from the [[Orcs|Goblins]] and killed their leader, [[Bolg]].<ref name="H18">{{H|18}}</ref>

After Thorin's burial, Beorn followed Bilbo, Gandalf and [[Thranduil]] on their way back to the west. Beorn once more hosted Bilbo and Gandalf and other [[Woodmen]] who came to celebrate [[Yule]].<ref name="H18" />

Eventually, he became a "great chief" in the [[Vales of Anduin]], and it is said that his descendants also were skin-changers, able to take the shape of a bear.<ref name="H18" /> His people became known as the [[Beornings]],<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''passim''</ref> and they helped defend [[Thranduil]]'s kingdom of northern Mirkwood.<ref>{{App|B3}}</ref>{{fact}}. Beorn presumably died some time before the [[War of the Ring]] began<ref>{{L|144}}</ref> and was succeeded by his son [[Grimbeorn|Grimbeorn the Old]].<ref>{{FR|II1}}</ref>

==Character & Appearance==
Beorn was a great strong black-haired man with huge arms and a great beard.<ref name="Queer" /> He was generally benevolent and hated goblins and wargs; but he was also a loner and distrustful of travelers and beggars. He was never polite, and became easily angry. He never invited people into his house and his very few friends, who lived a good way away, came no more than a couple to his house at a time. Added to this, Beorn was not fond of [[Dwarves]]. Although fierce to his enemies, once convinced of the others' goodwill, he was welcoming, generous and helpful. He did not eat any meat, as he could talk with his animals, who helped him. His grove was occupied by huge [[bees]]. Beorn's diet was mainly honey and cream.

==Etymology==
'''Beorn''' is an [[Old English]] word,<ref name="Shippey">[[Tom Shippey]], ''[[The Road to Middle-earth]]'' (revised and expanded ed. 2012), Chapter 3 The Bourgeois Burglar, The Ring as ‘Equalizer’, p. 91</ref><ref name="LT1">{{LT1|In}}, Commentary, about ''Beorn'', the brother of ''Eoh'' and uncle of ''Eriol''</ref><ref name="RC">{{HM|RC}}, p. 207</ref><ref>{{HM|IE}}, The Giving of Names, On Old English, pp. 212 and Meaningful Names, p. 218</ref> which originally meant "bear"<ref name="Shippey"/><ref name="LT1"/> and also means "prince",<ref name="RC"/><ref name="IE">{{HM|IE}}, The Giving of Names, p. 218</ref><ref name="BT">{{webcite|website=[http://www.bosworthtoller.com/ Bosworth-Toller Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]|articleurl=https://bosworthtoller.com/3757|articlename=BEORN|accessed=4 October 2025}}</ref> "nobleman",<ref name="RC"/><ref name="BT"/> "warrior"<ref name="RC"/><ref name="IE"/><ref name="LT1"/><ref name="BT"/> or poetic "man"<ref name="Shippey"/><ref name="RC"/><ref name="IE"/><ref name="BT"/>.<ref name="AH164">{{HM|AH}}, pp. 164-5</ref><ref name="RW">{{HM|RW}}, pp. 95-6</ref> It is cognate with the [[Old Norse]] word ''björn''.<ref name="LT1"/>

In the [[The Etymologies|''Etymologies'']], [[Ilkorin]] ''[[ber]]'' ("valiant man, warrior") and [[Danian]] ''[[Beorn (Nandorin)|beorn]]'' ("man") derive from the [[Elvish]] [[Sundocarme|root]] [[BER]].<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, root BER-; cf. root [[BES|BES-]]), p. 352</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In early manuscripts of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the name of the character that would become Beorn is ''Medwed''. Medwed's ability to change shape to a bear was due to an enchantment, perhaps of his own.<ref>{{HH|Medwed}}</ref> It has been suggested that ''Medwed'' is a Slavic name<ref>{{HH|Medwed}}, 'vi. Radagast', 'The Name Radagast'</ref> with ''[[wiktionary:medved|medved]]'' being a common Slavic word for "bear".

It should be noted that [[wiktionary:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/medv%C4%9Bd%D1%8C|''medved'']] is a taboo word for "bear" with the literal sense being "honey-eater"; the same etymology is constructed by J.R.R. Tolkien for the [[Noldorin]] word ''[https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2314741507.html megli]'' (''mad-'' "eat" + ''glî'' "honey"; thus "honey eater"),<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, root '''LIS-''' and root '''MAT-''' </ref> suggesting that Tolkien was aware of the slavic word.

==Inspiration==
It has been suggested that the character Beorn was influenced by the Norse ''[[Hrólfs saga kraka|Saga of Hrólfr Kraki]]''.<ref name="RME73">[[Tom Shippey]], ''[[The Road to Middle-earth]]'' (revised and expanded ed. 2012), pp. 91-2</ref> In the saga appears a great bear defending [[wikipedia:Hrólfr Kraki|Hrólfr Kraki]], and also a man cursed to being transformed into a bear during nighttime. The work was well-known to [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], as one of his students and friend, Stella Miller, made [[The Saga of Hrolf Kraki|a translation of the saga]] dedicated to Tolkien, [[E.V. Gordon]] and C.T. Onions;<ref name="AH164" /> but even more importantly as Tolkien himself wrote an unpublished short story of the tale, entitled ''[[Sellic Spell]]''.<ref>{{HM|MB}}, pp. 256-60</ref>

Another suggested inspiration is the character of ''[[Beowulf (poem)|Beowulf]]'', "''whose name is commonly explained as Beowulf = 'bees' wolf' = honey-eater = bear, and one who breaks swords, rips off arms and cracks ribs with ursine power and clumsiness.''"<ref name="RME73" />
