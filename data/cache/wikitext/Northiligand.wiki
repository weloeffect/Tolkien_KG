'''Northiligand''' was the lord of the [[Gondorian|people]] of the [[Ethir Anduin|Delta]] in the early drafts of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. He is mentioned in a sketch alongside [[Benrodir]] and [[Inram]] as one of the leaders of [[Gondor]] that came to the aid of [[Minas Tirith]] during the [[War of the Ring]].<ref>{{WR|3|II}}, ''Sketches for Book Five'', p. 252</ref> Nothing else is known about him, as he appears nowhere else in the [[legendarium]].

== Etymology ==
Earlier, his name was spelled '''''Nosdiligand''''', though Christopher Tolkien mentioned that a few of the letters are illegible.<ref>{{WR|3|II}}, ''Sketches for Book Five'', Note 24, p. 266</ref>

According to ''[[Eldamo]]'', the name ''Nosdiligand'' is in [[Noldorin]], but its meaning is unclear.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-1076410769.html|articlename=N. ''Nosdiligand'' m.|website=Eldamo|accessed=25 March 2022}}</ref>
