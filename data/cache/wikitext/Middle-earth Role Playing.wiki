'''Middle-earth Role Playing''' (MERP) was a subset of the Rolemaster role-playing game rules set in [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]] and published by [[Iron Crown Enterprises]].  

== Description ==
[[Image:Middle-earth Role Playing (2nd edition, hardcover).jpg|thumb|left|Cover of [[Middle-earth Role Playing (2nd edition, hardcover)|''MERP'', 2nd ed.]]]]
The system was somewhat like [[Dungeons and Dragons|Dungeons & Dragons]] with character classes and levels. Classes available included Animist (Cleric), Bard, Mage, Ranger, Scout (Thief) and Warrior (Fighter). The system departed in having a highly detailed combat and magic system.

In the MERP game system, attributes are rating between 0 and 100, and skills can surpass these limits (under 0 or over 100).  An attack roll would consist of a percentile roll + skill rating + attribute rating - target's dodge rating.  This result was looked up on a table against the victim's armor type (leather/plate). Most hits in combat would cause a 'critical' which would be rolled and looked up on separate tables.  For some, these criticals are quite entertaining due to their variety and creativeness, but for others the task of adding and subtracting high numbers and then consulting a table is the height of roll-playing, not role-playing.

Spell casters had the unique advantage in MERP that they learned lists of 10 spells (1 per level) as a unit. Once a character learned the Healing list, he would be able to cast increasingly better healing spells as his level increased.

The setting for this game predates the [[War of the Ring]] by around 1400 years (the majority of the modules were set in the years after the [[Great Plague]], ca. [[Third Age]] 1640) and as such it represented a version of [[Middle-earth]] different to that seen in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''  or ''[[The Hobbit]]''.

=== Metal miniatures ===

Three different companies issued authorized figures for use with MERP. In 1985, both [[Grenadier Models Inc.|Grenadier Models]]  and [[Citadel Miniatures]] released their respective ''Lord of the Rings Middle Earth'' series. In 1987, the license was transferred to [[Mithril Miniatures]], which still produces Middle-earth metal miniatures (although post-[[Iron Crown Enterprises|ICE]] figures have no reference to MERP).
