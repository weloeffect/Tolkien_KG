'''Ceorl''' was a rider of [[Rohan]] at the end of the [[Third Age]]. 

==History==
After the loss of the [[Second Battle of the Fords of Isen]], [[Erkenbrand]] withdrew his Riders to [[Helm's Deep]], and sent Ceorl south as a messenger to warn [[Éomer]].<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref> He was surprised to come across [[Théoden|King Théoden]]'s army riding north, ready to launch their own defence of the Fords. The news brought by Ceorl caused Théoden to reconsider his strategy, and he rode instead to join Erkenbrand at Helm's Deep, so setting the stage for the mighty [[Battle of the Hornburg]].<ref name="HD"/> 

==Etymology==
Like other [[Rohirrim]], Ceorl's name comes from [[Old English]]. It refers to a particular rank in Anglo-Saxon society (also known as [[Carl (disambiguation)|Carl]] and [[wikipedia:churl|Churl]]), in fact the lowest rank possible while remaining a freeman. Historically, these people would not normally have been professional soldiers, so if Ceorl's background follows his name, we might guess that he was a farmer or tradesman who had been pressed into military service to help deal with the imminent threat to [[Rohan]].

'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:Ceorl is omitted. [[Gandalf]] simply breaks off the main unit and rides to the Crossings of the Isen. 

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]
:Ceorl was voiced by [[Michael McStay]]. Virtually the whole of Ceorl's dialogue from the book was retained in the production.

'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''
:As [[Théoden]] rode directly to the [[Hornburg]], so there was no need for a messenger.

'''2001-2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'':'''
:A [[Decipher]] card identifies a one of the riders of [[Rohan]] as Ceorl. 

'''2013: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Ceorl encounters King Théoden's riders on their way from [[Edoras]] to the [[Fords of Isen]]. His only lines are nearly identical to those in the book.
