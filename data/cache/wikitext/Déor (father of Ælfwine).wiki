'''Déor''' was an [[wikipedia:English people|English]] [[Minstrels|minstrel]],<ref name="Min"/> and the father of [[Ælfwine]], according to the early version of the [[legendarium]] in the text called ''[[Ælfwine of England]]'' from ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''.<ref name="Deo"/>

== History ==
Déor came from somewhere in the south of [[Luthany|Lúthien]], though he also spent some time in [[Lionesse]] where he met his wife, whom he called [[Éadgifu]].

Later, he moved to the city of [[Kortirion#Other versions of the legendarium|Kortirion]],<ref group="note">Kortirion was the [[Qenya|Elvish]] name of the town of [[wikipedia:Warwick|Warwick]].</ref><ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''30''', p. 310</ref> ruled by the [[Prince of Gwar]] called [[Óswine (prince of Gwar)|Óswine]], for he wished to be close to the [[Elves]], who still lived around the city since Óswine was friendly to them. There, Éadgifu gave birth to their son Ælfwine, who inherited her mother's unquenchable longing for the sea.<ref name="Deo"/>

However, while Ælfwine was still a boy, a fierce people called the [[Forodwaith (The Book of Lost Tales)|Forodwaith]] (i.e. [[wikipedia:Vikings|Vikings]]) attacked Kortirion and laid siege to it, during which Déor died leading a "desperate sally" before the walls,<ref name="Deo">{{LT2|VIb}}, p. 313-4</ref> slain by [[Orm]] the sea-captain of the Forodwaith.<ref>{{LT2|VIb}}, p. 318</ref>

== Etymology ==
The name ''Déor'' is in [[Old English]], meaning "brave, bold".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 643</ref>

In one occurrence, the character was called ''Heorrenda'' before being changed back to ''Déor''.<ref>{{LT2|VIb}}, ''Changes made to names, and differences in names, in the texts of Ælfwine of England'', p. 334</ref>

== Inspiration ==
The character of Déor was probably inspired by the Old English poem ''[[Déor (poem)|Déor]]'', which also features a minstrel as the eponymous main character. However, according to [[Christopher Tolkien]], the only link between the two characters is their name.<ref name="Min">{{LT2|VIb}}, p. 323</ref>
