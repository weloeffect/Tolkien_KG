'''Roäc''' (b. {{TA|2788}}<ref name=H15/><ref group=note>When [[Thorin and Company]] met Roäc he told them that it was "a hundred years and three and fifty since I came out of the egg". Subtracting 153 from {{TA|2941|n}} yields 2788</ref>) was the chief of the [[ravens]] of [[Ravenhill]] near [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]].<ref name=H15>{{H|15}}</ref>

==History==
Roäc was the son of [[Carc]], and as such "''a descendant of those'' [ravens] ''that had remained on the hill even after Smaug had driven out their old allies, the [[Dwarves]]"''.<ref>{{webcite|author=Mark Fisher|articleurl=http://www.glyphweb.com/ARDA/r/roac.html|articlename=Roäc: The old raven of Ravenhill|dated=|website=EoA}}</ref>

While [[Thorin and Company]] and [[Bilbo Baggins]] were keeping watch on Erebor, an old [[thrushes|thrush]] summoned Roäc. When he met Thorin and Company in [[Third Age]] {{TA|2941|n}}, Roäc was marked by age, being 153 years old.<ref name=H15/>

Being able to speak [[Westron]], the raven delivered the news that [[Smaug]] had been killed. Roäc agreed to bring a message to [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin II Ironfoot]] from Thorin, a call for help in guarding the treasures of Erebor in the wake of war.<ref name=H15/> However, Roäc also gave a piece of advice to Thorin, warning him that "''the treasure is likely to be your death''".<ref name=H16>{{H|16}}</ref>



==Etymology==

''Roäc'' is likely an [[Wikipedia:Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] name.<ref>{{HM|AH}}, p. 316</ref>

==Inspiration==
{{seealso|Ravens#Inspiration}}
In [[Celtic]] (especially Irish) mythology, ravens are often associated with warfare and the battleground. In [[Welsh]] mythology, ravens figure as the army of King Arthur's knight Owain.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven_in_mythology#Celtic_mythology Raven in mythology: Celtic mythology] at [http://en.wikipedia.org/ Wikipedia] (accessed 4 December 2010)</ref>

In ''[[The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrún]]'', a raven and a finch speak five of the verses,<ref>{{HM|SG}}, pp. 116-117, 214-215</ref> reminiscent of Roäc and the old thrush.

This visually implies that Thorin sent a message with this raven, though it is not explained in dialogue, and the raven itself does not talk.
