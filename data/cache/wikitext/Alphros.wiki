'''Alphros''' ({{TA|3017}} - {{FoA|95}}) was the  twenty-fourth [[Prince of Dol Amroth]].<ref name=DolAmroth>{{PM|Elendil}}, ''The Line of Dol Amroth'', p. 223</ref>

==History==
Alphros was born near the end of the [[Third Age]], and was only a toddler when the [[War of the Ring]] raged in Gondor. Growing up in the [[Fourth Age]], he became Prince after his father [[Elphir]]'s death, and served under [[Aragorn|King Elessar]]. He died in {{FoA|95}}.<ref name=DolAmroth/>

==Etymology==
''Alphros'' seems to be a [[Sindarin]] name. Its meaning is not glossed, but it seems to mean "Swan Foam" and to be a combination of  ''[[alph]]'' "swan" and ''[[ros]]'' ("foam").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-1638885195.html|articlename=S.
