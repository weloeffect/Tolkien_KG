{{Quote|Gandalf was shorter in stature than the [[Elrond|other]] [[Glorfindel|two]]; but his long white hair, his sweeping silver beard, and his broad shoulders, made him look like some wise king of ancient legend.

'''Gandalf''' was one of the five [[Order of Wizards|Istari]] sent to [[Middle-earth]] by the [[Valar]] in the [[Third Age]]. In [[Valinor]] he was known as Olórin. Gandalf was instrumental in bringing about the demise of [[Sauron]] in {{TA|3019}}, chiefly by encouraging others and dispensing his wisdom at pivotal times. He was originally robed in grey, and second to [[Saruman]] in the Order of Wizards. After his fall in [[Moria]], Gandalf returned to Middle-earth as head of the Order, robed in white. He was noteworthy for his keen interest in [[Hobbits]].

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:Kip Rasmussen - Olorin in the Gardens of Lorien.jpg|thumb|left|''Olorin in the Gardens of Lorien'' by [[:Category:Images by Kip Rasmussen|Kip Rasmussen]]]]
The wisest of the [[Maiar]], Gandalf was created by [[Ilúvatar]] before the [[Music of the Ainur]].<ref name="Ainu">{{S|Ainu}}</ref> At the beginning of [[Time]], he was amongst the [[Ainur]] who entered into [[Eä]].<ref name="SVala">{{S|Vala}}</ref> In his "youth" he was known as '''''Olórin''''' and lived in [[Lórien (Valinor)|Lórien]]. Yet his ways often took him to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and patience.<ref name="vala">{{S|IIc}}, p. 316</ref> He became one of the [[Maiar]] who served [[Manwë]], [[Varda]], [[Irmo]], and [[Nienna]]. He was associated with light and fire, much like [[Varda]].

After the Valar discovered the primeval [[Elves]] at [[Cuiviénen]], Olórin was sent there as one of the [[Five Guardians]] to guard the Elves from the forces of [[Melkor]].<ref>{{NM|P1xiii}}, p. 95</ref> It is unclear how long he remained or if he accompanied the [[Eldar]] on the [[Great Journey]]. But it is said he loved the Elves, and throughout his early life, he walked [[Unseen]] among them, or wore a [[Fana]] that appeared like an Elf, and he sent them fair visions in their hearts that made them wiser. Throughout his existence, he followed the example of Nienna, taking pity on the sorrows of the [[Children of Ilúvatar]] and lifting out of despair those who listened to him.<ref name="vala" />

It is possible that Gandalf, as Olorin, came to Middle-earth in the Second Age. While Galadriel "dwelt now under the trees of Greenwood the Great" Olórin once had a conversation with her.<ref>{{UT|Elessar}}, p. 255</ref> It is possible that this was just after the year 1200, but it is said that "only those Wise could say who are now gone" could attest to the truth of this conversation.<ref>{{UT|Elessar}}, p. 268</ref>

===Third Age===
====Arrival in Middle-earth====
During the [[Third Age]], while [[Sauron|Sauron's]] 'dark spirit of malice' was increasing over [[Middle-earth]], the Valar chose the [[Istari]], missionaries from among the Maiar, to go to Middle-earth and help the [[Portal:Characters|peoples]]. [[Manwë]] selected Olórin, who, at first, did not wish to go, as he feared Sauron. However, Manwë said that it was all the more reason why he should go.<ref name="Istari">{{UT|13}}</ref> Furthermore, [[the One Ring]], the location of much of Sauron's power, presumably still existed somewhere in Middle-earth. 

Olórin submitted to the will of Manwë and departed Valinor to [[Mithlond]] in the year {{TA|1000}}.<ref name="Istari" /> He arrived shortly after two other Istari, [[Curumo]] and [[Aiwendil]], at about the same time the [[Necromancer]] appeared in [[Mirkwood]]. Like the other Wizards, he took the shape of an old man. He was robed in grey. 

At Mithlond, he was welcomed by [[Círdan]] the shipwright, who possessed [[Narya]], one of the [[Three Rings|Three]] Elven [[Rings of Power]]. Círdan divined in Olórin a sense of strength and power despite his appearance as a bent and aged old man. Círdan gave Narya to Olórin with a prediction of his future struggles with evil, and a promise that it would support and aid him in his labours. Then Círdan said "''But as for me, my heart is with the [[Belegaer|Sea]], and I will dwell by the grey shores until the last ship sails. I will await you.''"<ref name="ThirdAge">{{App|B2}}</ref>

[[File:John Howe - Gandalf the Grey.jpg|thumb|''Gandalf the Grey'' by [[John Howe]]]]
Gandalf then began his sojourn in Middle-earth, going about as a wanderer and counsellor. Unlike Saruman, Gandalf did not take up a single permanent residence. Gandalf never went to the [[east]]<ref name="TT Window p. 670">{{TT|Window}}, p. 670</ref> and apparently restricted his activities to the [[Westlands]] of Middle-earth, where the remnants of the [[Dúnedain]] and the [[Eldar]] remained to oppose Sauron. He was known by many names during the long years he remained in Middle-earth: Elves named him ''Mithrandir'', the Grey Pilgrim, while the men of [[Arnor]] named him '''Gandalf''', which became his most common name. He was also known as ''Incánus'' in the south, and ''Tharkûn'' to the [[Dwarves]].<ref name="Istari" />

A legend says that Gandalf was given the [[Elfstone]] of [[Eärendil]] by [[Yavanna]] to bring to the peoples of Middle-earth; this was to be a token that the Valar had not forsaken them. He gave it to [[Galadriel]], and remarked prophetically that she would in turn pass it to an individual who would also be called [[Aragorn|Elessar]].<ref>{{UT|6}}</ref>

====Early vigilance====
Around {{TA|1100}},<ref name="ThirdAge" /> the Istari and the Eldar discovered that some evil entity resided at [[Dol Guldur]] in Mirkwood. Dark shapes moved in the forest and evil began to multiply in the woods. Some thought a [[Nazgûl]] had returned to torment the world, or some new evil was arising.  Gandalf was unsure, and feared that perhaps Sauron himself might have returned.<ref name="Rings">{{S|Rings}}</ref>
[[File:John Howe - Pass the Doors of Dol Guldur.jpg|thumb|left|''Pass the Doors of Dol Guldur'' by [[John Howe]]]]
Over the next two hundred years the evil continued to grow, as well as the source directing it. [[Orcs]] were multiplying in the [[Misty Mountains]] and elsewhere. The [[Witch-king]], the mightiest of the Nazgûl, had built a fortress in [[Angmar]] in the Northern wastelands and waged unending war against the Kingdom of [[Arnor]]. Meanwhile [[Moria]] and [[Minas Ithil]] fell under a shadow, while other wars, plagues, and catastrophes occurred across Middle-earth. Gandalf went to Dol Guldur in {{TA|2063|n}} to discover its secret.<ref name="ThirdAge" /> An entity known only as the '[[Necromancer]]' fled before him preventing Gandalf from identifying him.<ref name="Rings" /> After Gandalf's incursion, the evil there seemed to desist, and its absence allowed for some centuries of calmness.

That peaceful period was known as the [[Watchful Peace]] and lasted for almost four hundred years. However, the Nazgûl had used this period to prepare for Sauron's return, which occurred in {{TA|2460|n}}.<ref name="ThirdAge" /> Realising the returning evil, the [[Wise]] formed the [[White Council]] three years later. [[Galadriel]], bearer of one of the Three Elven Rings and mighty among the Eldar, wished Gandalf to be the chief of the Council, but he refused the position wishing to set down no roots and to maintain his independence; Saruman took this place because of his vast knowledge.<ref name="Rings" />
[[File:Miriam Ellis - The Long Winter, 1158 - Gandalf Helps the Hobbits.jpeg|thumb|250px|left|"[[Long Winter|The Long Winter]], [[Third Age 2758|1158]]: Gandalf Helps the [[Hobbits]]" by [[Miriam Ellis]]]]
During his wanderings in [[Eriador]], Gandalf met and befriended the isolated and secretive people of the [[Hobbits]] in their country, [[The Shire]]. During the [[Long Winter]] of {{TA|2758|n}} Gandalf came to their aid.<ref name="ThirdAge" /> It was then when he witnessed and admired the pity and courage the humble Hobbits reserved in their hearts.<ref name="Erebor" /> 

When King [[Thráin|Thráin II]], a dwarf of the royal line of [[Lonely Mountain]], disappeared on a journey to [[Erebor]], Gandalf looked for him. At some point after {{TA|2845|n}} he entered the abandoned city of Khazad-dûm. After his vain search, the Wizard exited through the [[Doors of Durin]]; however this experience did not help him know how to open the doors from the outside.<ref name="journey">{{FR|Journey}}</ref>

In {{TA|2850|n}}, his quest led him once more to Dol Guldur, this time in secrecy.<ref name="ThirdAge" /> He found Thráin in the dungeons, who gave the Wizard his last possessions, the [[Thrór's Map|map]] and key to Erebor.<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}</ref> Most importantly, Gandalf found that the Necromancer was no Nazgûl, but was Sauron himself, and he had taken [[Ring of Thrór|the last]] of the [[Seven Rings]] from the Dwarf King. Sauron was gathering the remaining [[Rings of Power]] and possibly searching for his lost [[The One Ring|One Ring]].

Gandalf escaped Dol Guldur and returned to the White Council.<ref name="Rings" /> After relating his discoveries, he urged the council to attack Sauron while the One Ring was still lost and Sauron's power immature. But Saruman said that it was better to watch and wait, and that the One Ring had long ago rolled from [[Anduin]] to the Sea.<ref name="Rings" /> The majority of the council agreed with Saruman. [[Elrond]] Half-elven, a powerful member of the council, later privately told Gandalf he had a foreboding that the Ring would be found, and that the war to end the [[Ages|Age]] was coming. Indeed, he added, he feared that it would end in darkness and despair. Gandalf encouraged him, saying there were many "strange chances," and that, "''help oft shall come from the hands of the weak when the Wise falter''".<ref name="Rings" /> Gandalf did not yet realise that Saruman now wanted the Ring for himself and was secretly searching for it along the banks of the river Anduin.

====Quest for Erebor====
Gandalf would visit the Shire occasionally and participate in the [[Midsummer]]-eve parties of the [[Old Took]] where he impressed young Hobbits with his fireworks, and his stories about [[Dragons]], [[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|Goblins]] and princesses.<ref name="Erebor" /> He was thus known to be "responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into the Blue for mad adventures". He also met a relatively adventurous Hobbit named [[Bilbo Baggins]] although he was far from "adventuresome."<ref name="Party" />

Gandalf was concerned about the weak state of the North. [[Smaug]] the [[Dragons|Dragon]] had destroyed both the [[Kingdom under the Mountain]] and the town of [[Dale]], and Gandalf feared that [[Sauron]] might use the desolation around Erebor to regain the northern passes in the mountains and the old lands of Angmar. Gandalf knew that exiled Dwarf [[King of Durin's Folk]] [[Thorin Oakenshield]] planned to battle against Smaug, but he knew that it would not be enough. In {{TA|2941|n}},<ref name="ThirdAge" /> while staying the night in [[Bree]], Gandalf happened across the Dwarf King.<ref name="Erebor">{{UT|Erebor}}</ref> Thorin initiated conversation; he had been having a strange feeling urging him to seek Gandalf. Gandalf was intrigued, for he had thought to seek Thorin as well. They found they were taking the same road for a while (Thorin passing through [[the Shire]] on his way to the [[Blue Mountains|Ered Luin]]), and they agreed to travel together. Thorin wanted advice, and Gandalf in turn wanted to discuss the Dragon Smaug with Thorin.
[[File:David T. Wenzel - Good Morning Mr. Baggins.jpg|thumb|''Good Morning Mr. Baggins'' by [[David T. Wenzel]]]]
Ultimately, Gandalf concocted a plan wherein Thorin could destroy Smaug and recover his family fortune, albeit with a "burglar" of Gandalf's own choosing.  Gandalf had a feeling that a Hobbit should be involved, and he remembered Bilbo Baggins. At first he found only [[Holman Cotton]] as Bilbo had left on the occasion of the [[Yestare|Elven new year]], something that persuaded Gandalf that Bilbo was the right person for the job.<ref name="Erebor" /> He visited Bilbo later, bringing along the kinsmen of Thorin.<ref name="Party">{{H|Party}}</ref> In the end Gandalf convinced the reluctant Baggins to become a burglar for Thorin. 

Gandalf accompanied [[Thorin and Company]] to [[Rivendell]]. Gandalf saved them from a trio of [[Stone-trolls]], and later obtained the legendary sword [[Glamdring]] from their [[Trolls|Troll]]-hoard; Gandalf bore it thenceforth.<ref name="Mutton">{{H|Mutton}}</ref> He also helped Thorin and Company through the [[Misty Mountains]]. When they unknowingly camped in the [[Front Porch]] of the [[Goblin-town]], the Goblins captured the whole company except Gandalf, who surprised them much later by killing the [[Great Goblin]] and then rescuing the Dwarves and leading them to the exit.<ref name="Hill">{{H|Hill}}</ref> It was during this time that Bilbo obtained a "magic ring".<ref name="Riddles">{{H|Riddles}}</ref> The hobbit initially claimed he "won" it from the creature "[[Gollum]]" while the company was under the Misty Mountains,<ref name="Pan">{{H|Pan}}</ref> and he kept it secret from Gandalf for some time. 
[[File:Darrell Sweet - The Lord of the Eagles.jpg|thumb|''The Lord of the Eagles'' by [[Darrell Sweet]]]]
On their escape out, the Company was saved by the [[Eagles]] of the Misty Mountains; Gandalf once had healed the [[Great Eagle]] from a poisoned wound,<ref name="Pan" /> and thenceforth they became friends. The Eagles picked them up and flew them to their eyrie. The next day, they dropped them to the other side of the Mountains.<ref name="Pan" />

Gandalf then sought the hospitality of [[Beorn]], persuading him to welcome and host the whole Company in his [[Beorn's Hall|hall]]. But then he left the quest prior to its completion; after leading the Company to the outskirts of the [[Forest Gate]], he gave them some final advice (but little did he know that the lands had changed by then) before they entered [[Mirkwood]], and went to attend other obligations.<ref>{{H|Queer}}</ref> The [[White Council]] had met under the gravest of circumstances: Sauron's vast power was returning, even without his Ring. Gandalf at last convinced the Council to attack Dol Guldur, to which even Saruman agreed (as by now he feared Sauron as a rival, and wished to delay his search for the Ring). Gandalf joined his peers in assailing [[Dol Guldur]], ridding [[Mirkwood]] of the Necromancer's presence, who fled to [[Mordor]].<ref name="ThirdAge">{{App|B2}}</ref> When he was about to finish his task, news about what happened to Thorin's Company in Mirkwood reached him, and he realised that the instructions he gave them did not help; they had lost their way, and then vanished from the imprisonment of the [[Silvan Elves|Wood-elves]], who had captured them. He was anxious to get back to them as soon as possible.<ref>{{H|Welcome}}</ref>

Meanwhile Thorin's quest was successful: Erebor was retaken and Smaug was killed,<ref name="Fire">{{H|Fire}}</ref> but when Gandalf finally arrived to the area, he found the [[Dwarves of Erebor]] and [[Dwarves of the Iron Hills|the Iron Hills]] preparing for an attack by the [[Lake-men]] and the [[Elves of Mirkwood]]. He was with [[Bard]] and [[Thranduil]] and revealed his presence trying to reason with Thorin. When the attack was beginning, Gandalf halted them, to warn that the [[Orcs]] and [[Wargs]] were coming to claim the treasure. He invited [[Dáin Ironfoot]] for council, and soon Dwarves, Elves and Men formed an alliance, and defeated the [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]] in the [[Battle of Five Armies]].<ref name="Burst">{{H|Burst}}</ref> 

King Thorin was mortally wounded and after his funeral and the reestablishment of Erebor under Dáin, Bilbo and Gandalf left Erebor for the Shire; on the way, they celebrated [[Yule]] at Beorn's, and then returned to Rivendell, where Gandalf discussed with [[Elrond]] the events of Dol Guldur and the Lonely Mountain. Gandalf had accomplished his immediate goal, which was to destroy Smaug, who could have been used to disastrous effect by Sauron. A large number of Orcs and Wargs also were killed in the North, removing threats to Rivendell and Lothlórien.<ref name="Erebor" /> But they both agreed that it would be better if the Necromancer were banished from the world altogether.<ref name="H19">{{H|19}}</ref>

As Gandalf and Bilbo passed by the site of their former encounter with the stone-trolls, they recovered the gold of the troll-hoard they had buried.<ref name="H19" /> 

Gandalf was amazed by the hobbit; until then he had paid no attention to hobbits and knew little of them. For the rest of his sojourn in Middle-earth, Gandalf took a special interest in hobbits, and particularly in the Baggins family. [[Third Age 2949|Years later]], he and Balin paid a visit to Bilbo, discussing the news from Erebor and Dale.<ref name="ThirdAge" /><ref name="H19" />

====Return of the Shadow====
Despite the Council's hopes, Sauron was not weakened by this attack. He had foreseen the move that drove him from Mirkwood, and his retreat was but a feint. Ten years after the attack, Sauron declared himself openly in Mordor in {{TA|2951|n}} and rebuilt [[Barad-dûr]]. The White Council met for one last time in {{TA|2953|n}} to debate about the [[Rings of Power]]. Saruman quieted his peers, claiming to have knowledge that the One Ring was lost in the [[Belegaer]]. After their meeting, Saruman, jealous and afraid of Gandalf, set spies to watch all his movements; this would affect the peaceful Hobbits, as from this, Saruman discovered their existence and noted Gandalf's interest in the Shire. As a result, he started sending agents to [[Bree]] and the [[Southfarthing]].<ref name="ThirdAge" />

[[Gollum]] had come to Gandalf's knowledge, having left his hideout. He was looking for the thief of his ring: Bilbo. The [[Elves of Mirkwood]] had informed Gandalf that Gollum was traversing the forest. Then, coinciding with Sauron's declaration, Gollum apparently turned towards [[Mordor]] and was lost. Gandalf neglected the matter because he "had much else to think of at that time" and still trusted Saruman's knowledge. Later, Gandalf would regret this.<ref name="shadow" />

Meanwhile, Sauron began reassembling his forces for the final blow against the West. [[Easterlings]] from [[Khand]] and beyond the [[Sea of Rhûn]], joined by men from [[Harad]] reinforced his stronghold in [[Mordor]]; Orcs, trolls, and other foul beasts were multiplying while his minions were searching the Anduin for any sign of his precious One Ring.

Gandalf met [[Aragorn]], the hidden [[Heir of Isildur]] in {{TA|2956|n}}, and soon became friends with him.<ref name="ThirdAge" /> From that point on, Aragorn and Gandalf often worked together towards a common end - the defeat of Sauron.

He visited [[Minas Tirith]] and was welcomed by [[Faramir]], the son of the [[Ruling Steward]] [[Denethor]], and taught him from his wisdom. This displeased Denethor, who didn't trust Gandalf.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref>

[[File:Michele Mantoani - Gandalf.jpg|thumb|"Gandalf" by [[:Category:Images by Michele Mantoani|Michele Mantoani]]]]
During this period Gandalf visited the Shire frequently, especially his friend Bilbo Baggins, and his younger cousin, [[Frodo Baggins]]. He noted Bilbo's unusual youthfulness, despite his advancing age; the suspicious "[[The One Ring|magic ring]]" that Bilbo had acquired during his adventure began to weigh on his mind. Gandalf recalled the deceit Bilbo used in originally claiming it for his own — Bilbo had later admitted to stealing it from [[Gollum]]. Gandalf could see that Bilbo was very preoccupied with the ring. Such un-hobbitlike behaviour aroused his suspicions. In {{TA|3001|n}} he organised [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]], and before leaving the Shire, he convinced Bilbo to leave the Ring for Frodo. He then emphatically warned Frodo not to use it; Gandalf had begun to suspect that the "magic ring" was indeed a [[Ring of Power]].<ref name="party">{{FR|Party}}</ref> Around that time, Gandalf became unpopular in the Shire; he was blamed for Bilbo's disappearance, and was even accused of plotting with Frodo to get a hold on Bilbo's wealth.<ref name="shadow">{{FR|Shadow}}</ref><ref name="party" />

Gandalf was keen to find out more about Bilbo's ring, so he left the Shire,<ref name="party" /> and resumed his search for Gollum. In this, he sought the help of [[Aragorn]]. The [[Rangers of the North]] were put to guard the Shire more closely.<ref name="ThirdAge" /> Gandalf showed up only [[Third Age 3004|three years later]] to check on Frodo and the Shire, and continued for the next four years always turning up unexpectedly and disappearing before dawn. In {{TA|3009|n}} he renewed the hunt for [[Gollum]] with Aragorn, searching in the [[vales of Anduin]], [[Mirkwood]], [[Rhovanion]], and even to the edges of Mordor. The search lasted eight years, for Gandalf did not know that Gollum had been captured by Sauron.<ref name="ThirdAge" /> Gandalf regretted ignoring Gollum for so many years, as his trail had become cold, resulting in many dark and dangerous days for Gandalf.<ref name="shadow" />

Studying the records in [[Minas Tirith]], Gandalf found the [[Scroll of Isildur]] in {{TA|3017|n}}, and from this, pieced together the missing history of the One Ring. On his way back to the Shire, he got word from the [[Galadhrim]] that Aragorn had finally captured Gollum<ref name="ThirdAge" /> and so he went to [[Mirkwood]] to meet him. For days he interrogated him in order to verify what he already knew. A great fear came over him when he learned that Gollum had been to [[Barad-dûr]]. Sauron had tortured Gollum and learned of the "magic ring", as well as the names "Shire" and "Baggins". The effects that Gandalf had seen on Gollum and Bilbo convinced him that Bilbo's Ring was not simply one of the [[Rings of Power]]: it was the ''[[The One Ring|One Ruling Ring]]'' of Sauron. Gandalf then returned in haste to the Shire.<ref name="shadow" /><ref name="council">{{FR|Council}}</ref>

====War of the Ring====
[[File:Alan Lee - The Shadow of the Past.jpg|thumb|''The Shadow of the Past'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]
Gandalf returned to the Shire on [[12 April]] {{TA|3018}} and proved to Frodo that Bilbo's ring was the ancient [[One Ring]] which the Dark Power of [[Mordor]] was looking for. He told Frodo that he gathered much of this information by interrogating the creature [[Gollum]]. Frodo exclaimed that Gollum should have been killed, however Gandalf speculated that perhaps Gollum would have a part to play before the end, and in any case, it was not for Frodo to decide who should live and who should die.<ref name="shadow" />

Gandalf suggested that he should leave the Shire soon and take the Ring to [[Rivendell]]. Frodo decided to leave on his next birthday, pretending to be moving to [[Buckland]], to which Gandalf agreed. The wizard stayed in the Shire for over two months,<ref name="three">{{FR|Three}}</ref> during which time, on [[1 May]] he went to [[Sarn Ford]] and met again Aragorn, informing him of Frodo's plans.<ref name="FR|Strider">{{FR|Strider}}</ref> He had a sense of foreboding and heard [[Sauron's attack on Osgiliath|disturbing news about war]] in [[Gondor]] and a [[Black Shadow]].<ref name="council" /> He decided to leave for the South and left Frodo, promising to return for his birthday-farewell party in autumn, so that they would go to Rivendell together.<ref name="three" /> 

He wandered around [[Eriador]] hearing news from the refugees who had a fear they could not speak about, until he met [[Radagast]] who brought a message from [[Saruman]] that he must seek him at once, and a warning that the [[Ringwraiths]] were looking for the Shire.<ref name="council" /> Gandalf went to [[the Prancing Pony]] at [[Bree]]. Believing that he would not be able to return to Frodo in time, he wrote [[Gandalf's letter|a letter]],<ref name="council" /> urging him to move as soon as possible for Rivendell, and seek someone named "Strider", whose real name was Aragorn, with a [[Riddle of Strider|riddle]] to identify him; Gandalf would then try to catch up with them when he could. He instructed [[Barliman Butterbur]] to send the letter to [[Hobbiton]] and to expect a Mr. [[Baggins]] to arrive at the inn under the name of "[[Mr. Underhill]]". He left the inn, but Barliman would forget to send the letter.<ref name="FR|Strider" />

=====Treachery of Saruman=====
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Gandalf Escapes Upon Gwaihir.jpg|thumb|left|''Gandalf Escapes Upon Gwaihir'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
Soon thereafter, Gandalf arrived at Isengard. At their meeting, Saruman at last revealed his desire for the One Ring.<ref name="council" /> He offered to his "''old friend and helper''" that they take the Ring for themselves and seize power from Sauron.  Gandalf rejected this with horror, and was imprisoned by Saruman on the pinnacle of [[Orthanc]]. [[Gwaihir]], chief of the Eagles, soon arrived and helped Gandalf escape.<ref name="council" /> Gandalf knew he needed to return quickly to the Shire, as Frodo (and the Ring) were in grave danger from both Sauron's Nazgûl and Saruman's treacherous desire for the Ring.

Gandalf hurriedly went to [[Rohan]], desiring to find a strong steed; there he obtained [[Shadowfax]] from King [[Théoden]], who later resented the gift.<ref name="council" /> This lord of horses and Gandalf forged a special bond, and Gandalf made quick use of Shadowfax's incredible strength and endurance.

Gandalf sped to the Shire. Fortunately, Frodo had already left the Shire without waiting for Gandalf,<ref name="council" /> and was seeking [[Rivendell]]. Upon his arrival, Gandalf learned that the Nazgûl, arrayed as [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]], had been searching the area. Dismayed, he set out for Bree; Barliman apologised to Gandalf for forgetting to send the letter,  and was worried that the hobbits had left with Strider, the suspicious [[Rangers of the North|Ranger]]. But for Gandalf, this was a hope which far exceeded his expectations. After congratulating a puzzled Barliman, Gandalf slept the night at the inn and in the morning left for [[Weathertop]], a high point in the region, to observe the surrounding area.<ref name="council" /> 
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Fire on Weathertop.jpg|thumb|''Fire on Weathertop'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
There he was assaulted at night by the Nazgûl, but drove them off after a great battle of light and flame.<ref name="B3">{{App|B3}}</ref> These phenomena were seen by Aragorn and the hobbits from afar, although they were unaware that Gandalf was involved.<ref>{{FR|I11}}</ref> Before leaving Weathertop, he marked some stones with the [[cirth|certh]] G for them to find. The next day he escaped to the north, followed by four Riders.<ref name="council" />

He then went directly to Rivendell, arriving a few  days sooner than [[Aragorn]].<ref name="B3" /> But when they arrived, Gandalf and Elrond joined their powers to cause a flood in [[Bruinen]] to drown the Riders, allowing Frodo some time to reach Rivendell.<ref name="council" /> Then they welcomed Glorfindel, Aragorn and the hobbits upon their arrival. Frodo was sick with a [[Morgul-wound]], but was still in possession of the Ring.

=====Fellowship of the Ring=====
Elrond called a [[Council of Elrond|Council]] after Frodo was healed to consider the momentous decision of what would be done with the Ring. By chance, representatives of most of the free peoples were in Rivendell for various reasons. Elrond and Gandalf advised that the Ring should be destroyed in the fires of [[Orodruin]], where it was made. Others dissented or objected, but they eventually submitted to Gandalf's plan. Ultimately, Elrond appointed the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] as nine walkers, numerically set against Sauron's nine Nazgûl. The relatively small number reflected the realisation by Elrond and the other council members that the quest of Mount Doom would not rely upon strength of arms, but on stealth and good fortune. Gandalf was chosen to lead the company, which included [[Aragorn]], [[Boromir]], [[Legolas]] the Elf, [[Gimli]] the Dwarf, and the hobbits Frodo Baggins, who was named the [[Ring-bearer]], and [[Samwise Gamgee]], [[Peregrin Took]], and [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]].<ref name="council" />

Several obstacles stood in the company's way. The vast [[Misty Mountains]] had to be crossed, for Gandalf was determined not to lead the company near [[Isengard]]. Gandalf decided to take a southern route to the [[Redhorn Pass]] and there to cross the [[Misty Mountains]] near [[Caradhras]], thereby traversing the mountain range and avoiding Isengard.<ref name="The Ring Goes South, p. 283">{{FR|South}}, p. 283</ref> When this attempt failed due to a terrible storm, he decided to take the Fellowship through the ruins of Moria, where the remains of the great Dwarven city of [[Moria|Khazad-dûm]] were now a labyrinth of tunnels under the mountains. Others in the company were loath to enter the maze, as it was now the lair of orcs and something known only as "Durin's Bane".

At the [[Doors of Durin]] on the west side of the mountains, Gandalf, after some delay, spoke the password and led the company into the dark. Having been in Moria on an earlier perilous errand, he was somewhat familiar with the underground passages. Eventually the party came to the [[Chamber of Mazarbul]], where Gandalf read the [[Book of Mazarbul|Book of Records]], which revealed the fate of [[Balin]], the leader of an ill-fated attempt to re-colonise Moria. Soon after, the party was attacked by orcs, and forced to flee the chamber. By then, Gandalf was well aware of their location and he led the party quickly towards the eastern exit.
[[File:John Howe - Gandalf Falls with the Balrog.jpg|thumb|''Gandalf Falls with the Balrog'' by [[John Howe]]]]
However, [[Durin's Bane]] caught up to the group at the [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm]]. Gandalf and Legolas immediately realised what it was: a [[Balrogs|Balrog]] of [[Morgoth]]. Gandalf faced the demon and broke the bridge upon which they both stood, leaving the beast to fall into a seemingly bottomless chasm.  But the Balrog's whip lashed out, and grasped Gandalf by the knees, causing him to fall into the pit. While falling, Gandalf shouted "Fly, you fools" and vanished into the abyss.<ref name="bridge">{{FR|Bridge}}</ref>

Yet Gandalf did not die; he and the Balrog fought long in the bowels and deep places of [[Arda]]. After restless pursuit over the course of eight days, Gandalf and the beast finally came to the summit of the [[Endless Stair]] upon the peak of [[Celebdil]]. There, he [[Battle of the Peak|fought the demon]] for two days and nights. The Balrog had burst into flame anew when it exited the stairs; ice, wind, and smoke swirled about them as they duelled. Gandalf used his last measure of strength to slay the Balrog, throwing him down the mountainside in ruin. Gandalf's spirit then left his body, having sacrificed himself to save the Fellowship.

=====Gandalf the White=====
But Gandalf's spirit did not depart Middle-earth forever. As the only one of the five Istari to stay true to his errand, Olórin was sent back to mortal lands by [[Ilúvatar|Eru]], and he became Gandalf once again. Yet, as he was now the sole emissary of the Valar to Middle-earth, he was granted the power to "reveal" more of his inner [[Maiar]] strength.<ref>{{L|156}}</ref> This naked power that lay within him was seldom used during the remainder of his time in Middle-earth, as his mission was essentially the same: to support and succour those who opposed Sauron. Nevertheless, when Gandalf's wrath was kindled his "unveiled" strength was such that few of Sauron's servants could withstand him.
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Gandalf Returns.jpg|thumb|left|''Gandalf Returns'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
As he lay on the mountaintop, the great eagle [[Gwaihir]] came up and bore him to [[Lothlórien]], where he was clothed and replenished, and given a new staff by [[Galadriel]]. Gandalf soon learned that Frodo had left the Fellowship and was travelling to Mount Doom. As Frodo was beyond his assistance now, Gandalf promptly went south to [[Fangorn Forest]], where he met the [[Three Hunters]]: [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]], and [[Gimli]], and gave them messages from Galadriel. From them, he learned that Sam went with Frodo, and he was pleased with this.<ref name="TT White" />{{rp|496}} Then he called forth [[Shadowfax]], and rode with them to [[Edoras]]. There he found that Saruman's spy [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]] had deceived King [[Théoden]] into hopeless impotence. Gandalf quickly deposed Wormtongue and encouraged Théoden to ride west to war against [[Saruman]]. By now, Gandalf was keenly aware that the great war to end the age was beginning; if Saruman conquered Rohan, then Gondor would be alone with enemies on all sides.

At Gandalf's encouragement, King Théoden went west to Helm's Deep where he was quickly besieged; Gandalf then searched for [[Erkenbrand]] and the forces of the [[Westfold]], which he later found and led to the Deep, thus breaking the siege. Meanwhile, the [[Ents]], along with the hobbits Merry and Pippin, moved against Saruman and sent [[Huorns]] against the orcs, resulting in the utter ruin of the outer walls of [[Isengard]] and the complete annihilation of Saruman's orcs. After the battle, Gandalf went to [[Orthanc]] with Théoden, Aragorn, and a small group. There Saruman rejected Gandalf's offer of forgiveness with contempt. Gandalf then broke Saruman's staff and cast him from the Order and the Council.<ref name="TT Voice" />{{rp|583}} Gandalf imposed a strict watch on Isengard by the Ents and then advised King Théoden to ride to Gondor's defence as soon as possible. The wizard's mind had already turned to Gondor and the coming climactic battle in the east.

=====Siege of Minas Tirith=====
[[File:Donato Giancola - The White Rider.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|''The White Rider'' by [[Donato Giancola]]]] 
As a 'reward' for Pippin, who had foolishly gazed into a [[Palantíri|palantír]], Gandalf took the Hobbit with him to [[Minas Tirith]], the last bastion of the west. Soon after arriving, Gandalf confronted [[Denethor|Denethor II]], the [[Ruling Steward]], and learned that he was near despair over the death of his eldest son, [[Boromir]]. Pippin entered the Steward's service in payment of the debt that he and Merry owed: the death of Boromir. Ostensibly they were allies, but the Steward treated him with disrespect and suspicion. When [[Faramir]], the Steward's younger son, returned from [[Osgiliath]] and was attacked by Nazgûl, Gandalf upon Shadowfax drove them away by revealing the power within him. Later, Faramir told him that Frodo and Sam were still alive and headed towards Mordor.<ref name="RK Siege">{{RK|Siege}}</ref>{{rp|812}}

The city was soon besieged by a vast force from Mordor, led by the [[Witch-king]]. An ill-advised counterattack resulted in Faramir receiving a wound from a poisoned dart; he lay near death inside the Tower. Still, Gandalf encouraged the men of Minas Tirith to have hope, and dispelled the fear of the Ringwraiths by his very presence.  But Sauron's catapults hurled flaming bolts upon the city; soon the first circle of the city burned unchecked. Denethor then lost all heart as the city burned and his only remaining son hovered near death. He abandoned his leadership of the city, and Gandalf then took it upon himself to direct the defence of the city. When the gigantic battering ram [[Grond (battering ram)|Grond]] destroyed the ancient entrance to the city, Gandalf placed himself alone at the ruined gateway. The Witch-king then appeared in the midst of the blasted gate upon a black horse and threatened Gandalf with death; but Gandalf did not move — seated upon Shadowfax he defied the mightiest of Sauron's minions. However, the stand-off ended inconclusively, as the morning arrived along with the host of the Rohirrim. Hearing the horns of the [[Riders of Rohan]], the Witch-king departed.

However, Gandalf did not pursue his foe, for Pippin brought him news that Denethor was about to burn himself and his son Faramir to death on a pyre like the heathen kings of old. Gandalf rushed to stop this, and was able to save Faramir, but not Denethor, whose despair and grief had overcome his mind. Gandalf then learned how it was that Denethor's will had been broken: the Steward clutched a palantír in his hands as he burned.

Nevertheless, and against all hope, the siege was broken. [[Éowyn]] of Rohan and Merry defeated the Witch-king, whose last wail was heard by many as he was reduced to impotence. Soon after, Aragorn arrived with a large host of men from the southern fiefs upon a captured pirate fleet from Umbar. The forces of the men of the west then utterly defeated Sauron's attack against Minas Tirith, relieving the city and killing virtually all of the invaders. Gandalf's carefully laid plans and words of wisdom, along with acts of heroism not seen since the [[Elder Days]], had defeated Sauron's first move.

=====Last battle=====
But the attack against Minas Tirith was only a part of Sauron's plan to devastate the West and make himself the ruler of Middle-earth. Other armies moved in the north against [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] and the Kingdom of Thranduil, as well as against Lothlórien and other points along the [[Anduin]]. Still commanding vast armies of orcs and men, the Dark Lord soon would move against Gondor again; the remnants of the Edain and their allies had little hope against his almost limitless resources. 

In Minas Tirith, Gandalf was selected by Aragorn, [[Imrahil]], and [[Éomer]] (the remaining lords of the west) to be their leader in the coming final battles. This would be the culmination of Gandalf's efforts in Middle-earth. Fully aware that the West would stand or fall on the outcome of Frodo's mission, he advised the lords to drive north to the [[Morannon]], thereby drawing Sauron's eye away from Frodo's likely location. This plan would likely result in a catastrophic loss for the outnumbered army, but it gave Frodo a chance to achieve the quest of Mount Doom.

Led by Gandalf and Aragorn, the army of the West crossed the Anduin and marched north, pausing occasionally to announce their coming, and to dispatch small numbers of men to lesser tasks. Upon arriving at the Black Gate, the forces halted and prepared for battle. As they ordered their companies, the foul [[Mouth of Sauron]] rode forth to parley with them; he revealed Frodo's [[Mithril-coat]] and [[Barrow-blade]] and implied that their owner was captured and tortured. The emissary of Sauron then proposed that the forces of the west surrender; Gandalf however was undaunted, and, seizing his friend's belongings, rejected Sauron's offer. In shock, the Mouth of Sauron turned back towards the Black Gate, which slowly opened to reveal a vast army of orcs and trolls advancing on the lords of the west. Sauron's trap was sprung.

Yet Sauron himself became the victim of Gandalf's trap. Unbeknownst to all, Frodo and Sam had succeeded in scaling Mount Doom. Even as the Battle of Morannon began, Frodo stood at the [[Crack of Doom]]. But the power and lure of the Ring finally overcame his will and he placed the ring upon his finger, claiming it as his own. Immediately the Nazgûl were summoned by their lord, as he in terror realised his blunder: his enemies intended to destroy his Ring.

[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Shadow of Sauron.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''The Shadow of Sauron'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
But Gandalf's foresight proved accurate again as the creature Gollum, who had been doggedly following the Ring-bearer, seized the Ring from Frodo, and, while celebrating his reunion with "his precious," unwittingly fell into the fires of Orodruin. The ring was unmade as the fiery mountain erupted. The tower of [[Barad-dûr]] and the [[Towers of the Teeth]] began to collapse, their foundations crumbling. The Ring-wraiths burned out like shooting stars, and Sauron was reduced to a mere shadow of malice, never to torment the world again.

With Sauron gone, his forces scattered; the Men of the West now set upon them with fury. Gandalf announced the success of the [[Ring-bearer]] and the end of Sauron; the quest had been fulfilled.  Seeing that victory was achieved, Gandalf then mounted [[Gwaihir]] the Eagle for the third time, and set out for Mount Doom in search of Frodo and Sam. To his great relief, the two were found on the slopes of Orodruin, clinging to life amid the volcanic eruptions.<ref>{{RK|Doom}}</ref>{{rp|948–51}} The great quest was over.

====End of the Order====
In Minas Tirith, Gandalf and the remaining members of the Fellowship reunited. At the coronation of King [[Aragorn|Elessar]], Gandalf, at Aragorn's request, set the crown upon the King’s head, and declared "''Now come the days of the King, and may they be blessed while the thrones of the [[Valar]] endure!''". Thus Gandalf ushered in the new age of men.

After the coronation and wedding of Aragorn to [[Arwen]], Gandalf left with the rest of the remaining Fellowship on the journey home. For Gandalf, it was his last long journey in Middle-earth. His errand to Arda had been fulfilled; Sauron had been defeated. He said farewell to his friends one by one until at last only the four Hobbits remained at his side. At the borders of the Shire he, too, turned away. He left the Hobbits to settle the affairs of the Shire themselves, for the shattered pieces of evil still remaining in the world were no longer his concern, and went to talk to [[Tom Bombadil]].<ref>{{RK|Homeward}}</ref>{{rp|996}}
[[File:The Brothers Hildebrandt - At the Grey Havens.jpg|thumb|"At the Gray Havens" by [[The Brothers Hildebrandt]]]]
What Gandalf did during the next two years is unknown; it is possible that his "''long talk''" with Bombadil was just that. At any rate, on [[29 September]] {{TA|3021|n}}, he met [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] at [[Mithlond]], ready to take the [[White Ship]] over the [[Belegaer|sea]] to [[Aman]].  He wore [[Narya]] openly on his finger, and Shadowfax was beside him (perhaps even to take ship with him). His mission was over, and his homecoming after more than 2000 years was nigh. He bade farewell to [[Samwise Gamgee|Samwise]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]], and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] (the later two of whom he had forewarned of the passage), then boarded the ship beside Frodo, Bilbo, Elrond, and Galadriel. The ship passed west upon the sea,<ref>{{RK|Havens}}</ref> and then took the hidden straight path to [[Valinor]]. Gandalf became Olórin once more. There, presumably, he dwells still in the gardens of [[Irmo]]. Olórin, the wisest of the Maiar and the sole Istar to remain true to his mission, had successfully kindled the hearts of the [[free peoples]] of Middle-earth to overcome the evil of their time. <!--In a large way, it was his victory.-->

==Characteristics==
===Personality===
[[File:Roger Garland - Gandalf.jpg|left|thumb|The Grey Pilgrim relaxing. Art by [[Roger Garland]]]]
Gandalf is often described in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as quick to anger, and equally quick to laugh.<ref name="Lorien">{{FR|Lorien}}</ref> He had great pity and patience, even extending to the servants of his enemies. He is said to have learned both from Nienna in Valinor.<ref name="vala" />
[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - G for Gandalf.png|thumb|Gandalf's signature, the [[cirth|rune]] "G".]]
Keen observers of Gandalf often detected a veiled power, usually revealed in his eyes, which appeared deep and wise.<ref>{{RK|MT}}</ref>{{rp|757}} He was alternately affectionate and brusque; he often surprised others with his bluntness when time was of the essence. Gandalf consistently upbraided foolish behaviour, but also richly rewarded those who acted with good intentions.

Hobbits appealed to him more than to the other Wizards, and he often went to the Shire for respites from his errands. It may be that he was amused by their nature. It may also be because they were untouched by the great evils of the world, and were more in touch with nature than Men; perhaps their agrarian lifestyle appealed to Gandalf's innate spirit and reminded him of the gardens of Valinor.

[[Círdan]] the Shipwright divined in him "the greatest spirit and the wisest" out of all of the Wizards that came from the West, and so he entrusted the care of [[Narya]], one of the [[Three Rings]] of the Elves, to Gandalf rather than to Saruman.<ref name="Istari" />

===Appearance===
[[File:John Howe - Gandalf the Grey 02.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Gandalf the Grey'' by [[John Howe]]]]

The first description of Gandalf is preserved in the initial pages of ''The Hobbit'', written in the early 1930s. Gandalf's fame is alluded to even before his physical description ("Tales and adventures sprouted up all over the place wherever he went, in the most extraordinary fashion"), while the protagonist's ("unsuspecting Bilbo") impression is that of:
{{Blockquote|...an old man with a staff. He had a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak, a silver scarf over which a white beard hung down below his waist, and immense black boots.|''[[The Hobbit]]'', "[[An Unexpected Party]]"}}

Later, [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] wrote: 
{{Blockquote|...a figure strongly built and with broad shoulder, though shorter than the average of men and now stooped with age, leaning on a thick rough-cut staff as he trudged along... Gandalf's hat was wide-brimmed [...] with a pointed conical crown, and it was ''blue''; he wore a long ''grey'' cloak, but this would not reach much below his knees. It was of an elven silver-grey hue, though tarnished by wear - as is evident from the general use of grey in [[The Lord of the Rings|the book]]... But his colours were always white, silver-grey, and blue - except for the boots he wore when walking in the wild...Gandalf even bent must have been at least 5 ft. 6... Which would make him a short man even in modern England, especially with the reduction of a bent back.<ref name="MB" />}}

Although some of the Wise knew his true nature, his "wizard-like" appearance caused many to mistake him for a simple conjurer. After his return, his "signature colour" changed from grey to white, for he had been sent back to replace the corrupt Saruman as the chief of the Wizards. In the book, he claimed that, in some ways, he now "was Saruman", or rather Saruman as he should have been.<ref name="TT White" />{{rp|495}}

===Powers and abilities===
[[File:Roger Thomasson - Gandalf the Grey.jpg|thumb|''Gandalf the Grey'' by [[Roger Thomasson]]]]
Gandalf demonstrated extensive knowledge of the land and an assortment of magical abilities from trivial to essential. 

Gandalf was the bearer of [[Narya]], the Ring of Fire, and described himself as the "servant of the [[Secret Fire]]" and "wielder of the [[flame of Anor]]".<ref name="bridge" /> Many of Gandalf's displays of power were related to fire in some way. It is not known, though, whether or to what extent his possession of Narya affected his abilities.

He created blinding flashes and other pyrotechnics to distract the [[Orcs|goblins]] of the [[Misty Mountains]] during Thorin and Company's escape from [[Goblin-town]]. On the eastern slopes, he turned pine cones into flaming projectiles that threw hot sparks and started fires that would not easily go out.

When the Fellowship was attacked by [[Wargs]] in [[Eregion|Hollin]], Gandalf spoke words of power to inflame the trees on the hillock where the company had camped. While crossing the Misty Mountains with the Fellowship, he was able to start fires under blizzard conditions. On the journey through Moria he created lights of varying intensity, magically secured doors, and broke the [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm]]. He fought and killed the [[Durin's Bane|Balrog of Moria]], although he did not himself survive the battle.<ref name="bridge" />

Sent back to [[Middle-earth]] as Gandalf the White, he possessed greater charisma and a limited degree of clairvoyance, although he was unable to peer into the land of [[Mordor]] to see the progress of Frodo and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]]. His power and authority had increased so that he could break [[Saruman]]'s staff with a spoken command, throw the treacherous wizard out of the order.<ref name="TT Voice">{{TT|Voice}}</ref>{{rp|583}} He also prevented Sauron's Eye from locating Frodo.<ref name="TT White">{{TT|White}}</ref>

He frequently used his powers for entertainment. He blew glowing smoke rings that moved around the room at his direction, and was known among Hobbits for his fireworks displays,<ref name="Erebor" /> for example at [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]].<ref name="party" />

When angered or aroused for battle, he seemed to grow in height and assume a terrifying aspect.<ref name="party" />{{rp|34}} 

Though not as keen as [[Elves]], his eyesight was sharp enough to see in darkness, and into the [[Unseen]].

===Special equipment===
It is unknown whether Gandalf required his staff to exercise certain powers. At times it appeared to focus or extend his powers, such as its emanation of light. [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]] tried to forbid Gandalf from bringing it into [[Edoras]] in a clear attempt to limit his powers.<ref>{{TT|King}}</ref>{{rp|514}}

When he arrived in Middle-earth, Gandalf received the Elven ring [[Narya]] from [[Círdan]].<ref name="Istari" /> Gandalf wore it from that time to the end of the Third Age, but how he used its powers is not known.

In {{TA|2941}}, Gandalf acquired the Elven sword [[Glamdring]] from the treasure hoard of a band of trolls.<ref name="Mutton" /> He continued to wield this weapon throughout ''The Lord of the Rings'', in particular during his fight with the [[Durin's Bane|Balrog]] in Moria.

Throughout his time in Middle-earth Gandalf was often seen with a pipe which he used to smoke [[Old Toby]].

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Gandalf.mp3|Ardamir}}
{{Pronounce|Quenya - Olórin.mp3|Gilgamesh}}
''Gandalf'' is a [[North Germanic languages|Norse]] name and supposedly means "Elvish wight with a (magic) staff", for it contains the element ''gandr'' ("a staff, especially one used in 'magic'"). It is a substitution in the English narrative for an unknown [[Westron]] name (on the same lines as the treatment of Hobbit and Dwarf names).<ref>{{UT|13}}</ref><ref group="note">Since the name ''Gandalf'' is attributed to "the North" in general, it probably represents a Westron name, but one made up of elements not derived from Elvish tongues.</ref>

The Men of the North called him so because they incorrectly thought that he was of Elven-kind<ref name="essay">{{UT|Istari}}, citing from the essay on the Istari</ref> and because they knew his alliance and friendship with Elves well<ref name="long note">{{UT|Istari}}, citing from a long note from before the publication of the second edition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' in 1966</ref>.

Gandalf is also the name of a dwarf in the [[Völuspá]], one of the poems of the [[Poetic Edda]]<ref>{{UT|13a}}, "12"</ref>, from where Tolkien got many of the Dwarven names used in his books.

==Other names==
{{quote|Many are my names in many countries. Mithrandir among the Elves, Tharkûn to the Dwarves; Olórin I was in my youth in the West that is forgotten, in the South Incánus, in the North Gandalf; to the East I go not.|''[[The Two Towers]]'', "[[The Window on the West]]"}}
*'''Greyhame''': Used in [[Rohan]],<ref>{{TT|Riders}}, p. 435</ref> it was the equivalent in [[Rohanese]] of ""Greycloak" which would have been ''grēg-hama''.<ref name="nomen">{{HM|N}}, entry '''Greyhame''', p. 758</ref>

*'''''Incánus''''': Gained during his long travels "in the south" (likely meaning no further south than [[Gondor]] or the [[Near Harad]]<ref name="Istari" />) of [[Middle-earth]] in the mid-[[Third Age]].<ref name="TT Window p. 670" /> Although ''Incánus'' seems to be of unclear language and meaning, a note in the [[Thain's Book]] says it is a [[Quenya]] form simply adapted from a word in the tongue of the [[Haradrim]]: ''Inkā-nūsh'' (or possibly ''Inkā-nūs''), meaning "North-spy".<ref name="Istari" /> <br />''Incánus'' in Latin means "grey-haired". However, [[Christopher Tolkien]] has noted that the "coincidence in form" might be an "accident",<ref name="Istari" /> his father wrote "Incánus Latin" in a later published manuscript,<ref name="PE1788" /> suggesting that the similarity was perhaps more than a coincidence. <br />Tolkien also changed his mind several times about the meaning of ''Incánus'', besides the etymology given above his other variations were: 
**An archaic [[Quenya]] word meaning "Mind-ruler", from ''in(id)''- ("mind") and ''cáno'' ("ruler, governor, chieftain").<ref name="Istari" />
**An adaptation from Quenya ''incānus(se)'', meaning "mind mastership".<ref>{{PE|17}}, entry Q ''incānus(se)'', p. 88 and entry √'''IN-''', p. 155</ref>
**A possible [[Westron]] invention meaning "Greymantle".<ref name="Istari" /> In a draft manuscript of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', different names used were ''Forlong''>>''Fornold''>>''Incânus''.<ref name="WR2V" />

*'''Láthspell''': The name given to Gandalf by [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]] when the former arrived at [[Meduseld]]. It means "Ill-news".<ref name="King">{{TT|King}}, p. 513</ref> It is a modernized form of [[Old English]] ''lad-spell'' ("a painful grievous story") from ''lad'' ("causing hate, evil, injury") and ''spell'' ("story", "message").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 404</ref> In earlier drafts, it is actually Théoden who refers to Gandalf as Láthspell.<ref name="TIKing">{{TI|King}}, p. 444</ref>

*'''''Mithrandir''''': His [[Sindarin]] name ({{IPA|[miˈθrandir]}}), used in [[Gondor]] and meaning "Grey Pilgrim" or "Grey Wanderer", from ''[[mith]]'' ("grey") + ''[[randir]]'' ("pilgrim, wandering man").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 320</ref><ref>{{PE|17}}, entry S '''Mithrandir''', p. 60</ref>

*'''''Olórin''''': His original name in [[Valinor]]. It is [[Quenya]], and its meaning is associated with the Quenya word  [[olos|''olos'' or ''olor'']], meaning "dream" or "vision / of mind".<ref name="Istari" /><ref name="PE1788">{{PE|17}}, Q '''Olórin''' , p. 88</ref> In a draft manuscript of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', occurs the spelling ''Olórion''.<ref name="WR2V">{{WR|2|V}}, p. 153</ref>

*'''Stormcrow''': The name given to Gandalf by King [[Théoden]] in [[Rohan]], a reference to his arrival being associated with times of trouble.<ref name="King" />

*'''''Tharkûn''''': The name given to Gandalf by the [[Dwarves]].<ref name="TT Window p. 670" /> ''Tharkûn'' is [[Khuzdul]], meaning either "Grey-man"<ref>{{PE|17}}, entry D '''Tharkûn''', p. 88</ref> or "Staff-man".<ref name="Istari" /> The word possibly derives from the unattested word ''thark'' ("staff") + a nominal ending ''-ûn''.<ref>Mellonath Daeron, "[https://www.forodrim.org/daeron/md_khuzdul.html An analysis of Dwarvish]" (accessed [[11 October]] [[2010]])</ref> In a draft manuscript of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', occurs the spelling ''Sharkûn''.<ref name="WR2V" />

*'''The White Rider''': The name given to him by Aragorn when he rides the great horse [[Shadowfax]].<ref>{{TT|White}}, p. 500</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In early manuscripts of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', the name ''[[Bladorthin]]'' was used by Tolkien for the character who later would be named ''Gandalf''. The name ''Gandalf'' was instead used for the character known as [[Thorin]] in the published works.<ref>{{HH|Intro}}</ref>

==Inspiration==
[[File:Georg von Rosen - Oden som vandringsman, 1886 (Odin, the Wanderer).jpg|thumb|''Oden som vandringsman'' (''Odin the Wanderer'') by Georg von Rosen]]
[[File:Josef Madlener - Der Berggeist.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Der Berggeist]]'' by [[Josef Madlener]]]]

''Gandalfr''<!-- this is the nominative, not a typo!-->
appears in the list of dwarves in the ''[[Völuspá]]'' of the Elder Edda, the name means "Cane-elf". Tolkien took the name along with the other dwarves' names when he wrote ''The Hobbit'' in the 1930s. He came to regret the creation of this "rabble of eddaic-named dwarves [...] invented in an idle hour",<ref>{{TI|Runes}}, p. 452</ref> since it forced him to come up with an explanation of why Old Norse names should be used in [[Third Age]] Middle-earth. He solved the dilemma in 1942 by the explanation that [[Old Norse]] was a ''translation'' of the [[language of Dale]]. The figure of Gandalf has other influences from Germanic mythology, particularly Odin in his incarnation as "the Wanderer", an old man with one eye, a long white beard, a wide brimmed hat, and a staff: Tolkien states that he thinks of Gandalf as an ''"Odinic wanderer"'' in a letter of 1946.<ref>{{L|107}}</ref>

Tolkien had a postcard labelled ''[[Der Berggeist]]'' ("the mountain spirit"), and on the paper cover in which he kept it, he wrote "the origin of Gandalf" at some point. The postcard reproduces a painting of a bearded figure, sitting on a rock under a pine tree in a mountainous setting. He wears a wide-brimmed round hat and a long cloak and a white fawn is nuzzling his upturned hands.
[[Humphrey Carpenter]] in his 1977 biography said that Tolkien had bought the postcard during his 1911 holiday in Switzerland. However, Manfred Zimmerman discovered that the painting was by German artist Josef Madlener and dates to the late 1920s.<ref>[[Manfred Zimmermann]], "The Origin of Gandalf and Josef Madlener", in ''[[Mythlore]]'' [[Mythlore 34|34]] (Winter [[1983]])</ref> Carpenter concluded that Tolkien was probably mistaken about the origin of the postcard himself. Tolkien must have acquired the card at some time in the early 1930s, at a time when ''The Hobbit'' had already begun to take shape.

Later, Frodo recieves [[The One Ring|Bilbo's ring]] as a birthday present and asks Gandalf about its purpose, having previously seen Biblo disappear with it. Gandalf tells Frodo of the forging of 20 magical rings and asks whether there are any marks on Bilbo's. Gandalf throws it into the fireplace, which reveals [[Ring-inscription|text]] on the ring, confirming Gandalf's suspicion that Bilbo's ring is indeed [[The One Ring]]. He encourages Frodo to bring the ring to [[Rivendell]] and participate in the [[Council of Elrond]]. He was imprisoned by [[Saruman|Saruman the Whute]] on [[Orthanc|his highest tower]] and was able to escape by sending a message to the birds and being rescued by the [[Eagles|Eagle]] [[Gwahir]]. He flys to [[Rohan]] and is dropped off. Gandalf is given permission by [[Théoden|the king]] to take a horse for himself. When looking for one, he discovers a a majestic white horse, named [[Shadowfax]] by the [[Men]] of Rohan. Gandalf notes his beauty, speed and the fact that that no man had ever rode him. Gandalf tames him and rides him to the Shire. He narrowly misses the Hobbits who are in the [[Old Forest]]. Gandalf, unable to meet with the Frodo, and his Hobbit friends who agree to accompany him, at the ''[[Prancing Pony|Prancing Pony Inn]]'', writes Frodo a letter, confirming that the man known as Strider is called [[Aragorn]] and is a man to be trusted. Finally arriving at the Prancing Pony, he hears word that Frodo had set off and he spends the night. The next day, [[Bree]] is stormed by [[Nazgûl|Black Riders]] and Gandalf pursues them on Shadowfax to [[Weathertop]]. He arrives at Rivendell 3 days before Frodo. When Frodo arrives, he is comatosed by his encounter with the Black Riders. He greets Frodo when he recovers, 4 days after the Hobbit's arrival in Rivendell. He reunites with the Hobbits at the Council in Rivendell and tells the Council members of his journey. He agrees to join the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], which aims to bring the Ring to [[Mordor]] and destroy it. The Fellowship sets off with Gandalf leading the group. They take one final look at the House of Elrond and depart.

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (video game)#Game Boy Advance version|''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'' (Game Boy Advance)]]:'''
:In the [[wikipedia:Game Boy Advance|Game Boy Advance version]] of [[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (video game)|The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]] Gandalf is a playable character. Gandalf's story starts with a conversation between Gandalf and [[Théoden]], after which the story goes back to the [[Caradhras]], where the Fellowship tries to travel over the  [[Misty Mountains]]. When that road fails, the Fellowship goes back and travels through [[Moria]]. In Moria Gandalf and the other member of the Fellowship are separated. After finding [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], [[Aragorn]] and [[Gimli]] the fellowship is attacked by a [[Cave-trolls|Cave-troll]] and [[Orcs#Orcs and Goblins|Goblins]].

:The game ends with the [[Battle of the Hornburg|Battle of Helm's Deep]], in which Gandalf and Éomer fight alongside Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and [[Éowyn]] while protecting the wall, the [[Hornburg]] and the [[Glittering Caves]]. In the final level Gandalf has to destroy the siege weapons that bombard the Hornburg. The game ends with a conversation between Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli and Théoden.

'''2003: [[The Hobbit (2003 video game)|''The Hobbit'' (2003 video game)]]:'''
:[[Jim Ward]] provided the voice of Gandalf. He is shown with actual [[magic]]: he can shoot blue bolts of lightning from his staff.

'''2003: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' (video game)]]:'''
:Gandalf is the narrator, and a playable character. The game is built around him; the cut scene narration shows how he planned for the [[War of the Ring]]. He has several missions, collectively called the "Path of the Wizard". The first is the [[Battle of the Hornburg|Battle of Helm's Deep]], which serves as a training mission. He has to fight [[Uruk-Hai]] in the forest of [[Huorns]] and [[Ents]] in "The Road to Isengard". After that, the missions move to [[Minas Tirith]]: the first mission, "Top of the Wall", has Gandalf warding off ladders and siege towers. In the second, "Courtyard", he has to protect civilians from the invading Orcs. His last playing mission is the [[Battle of the Morannon|Battle of the Black Gate]].

'''2003: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' (Game Boy Advance)]]:'''
:Just like on the console version of the game, Gandalf is a playable character. He has many missions, collectively called the "The Journey of the Wizard". He starts in a flooded [[Isengard]], where he has to kill several [[Uruk-hai]] and [[Crebain]] before he confronts [[Saruman]]. After the defeat of Saruman he travels to [[Minas Tirith]] through Rohan and the Misty Mountains. At the [[Pelennor Fields]] Gandalf has to protect the [[Beacons of Gondor|beacons]], so Rohan can be warned. During the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields|Battle of Minas Tirith]] he has to protect the gate, before making his way to the [[House of the Stewards|Steward's Tomb]]. Here Gandalf has to kill Denethor, before he burns [[Faramir]]. After the battle Gandalf travels through [[Ithilien]] to the [[Black Gate]], where he confronts a Nazgûl.

'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age]]'':'''
:Gandalf, voiced by [[Ian McKellen]], is a character in [[Electronic Arts|EA's]] "alternative [[Fellowship of the Ring|fellowship]]" game. In his battle against Durin's Bane, he is aided by the main characters.

'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring]]'':'''
:Gandalf is voiced by [[Steven M. Kramer]], renowned for playing older mentor types.

'''2004: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth]]'':'''
:In non-storyline skirmishes Gandalf is the hero of the Gondor faction, who possesses several magical abilities. At first, he appears as Gandalf "the Grey", and becomes "Gandalf the White" after reaching level 5 (out of 10). Gandalf also narrates the prologue scene, repeating almost word for word the lines said by Galadriel in the ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]''.

:His involvement in the storyline is notable for major differences from the original tale. First of all, Gandalf survives his encounter with Balrog, defeating him at the Bridge of Khazad-dum and continues the journey with the Fellowship - by the time of arrival in Lothlorien he already appears as Gandalf the White. He is present during the ambush at [[Amon Hen]], where thanks to his involvement Boromir is saved from certain death. Merry and Pippin are captured regardless and Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Boromir give chase, while Gandalf departs them to see to dealings in Rohan, including freeing of King Théoden from the spell. Following the Battle of Helm's Deep he travels to Minas Tirith along with both Pippin and Boromir, where they participate in the Siege of the city.

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:Gandalf is a hero for the "Men of the West" faction. Similar to the first game, he appears as Gandalf the Grey initially and Gandalf the White after level 5. He plays no part in the main storyline, but appears in the alternate "evil" campaign: after Sauron reclaims the Ring and lays waste to southern lands, Gandalf and few other survivors meet their end during a last stand in Rivendell.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Gandalf is a non-playable character voiced by [[Harry Chase]], who narrates cutscenes and instances throughout the original game, before the first expansion. He first meets the Dwarven characters in Ered Luin in {{TA|2941}}, shortly before the Quest for Erebor. Later, characters of all races meet him in Bree in October of {{TA|3018}}, but he is too busy with concerns for Frodo and the Ring and merely sends them away to find Radagast. Finally, the players have a chance to have a proper conversation with him in Rivendell, following the Council of Elrond. During that time, Gandalf is involved in several quests, including helping the player wreck havoc among the Goblins stirring at the [[High Pass]]. After the Fellowship leaves Rivendell, players are able to retrace many of their steps, including the marks left by Gandalf such as the Burnt Top in [[Eregion]] and the remains of his fire at the pass of [[Caradhras]]. Later, Lady [[Galadriel]] bids the player to find the signs of Gandalf following his fall from the Bridge of Khazad-dum - said signs include his burnt hat at the Foundations of Stone in Moria and the signs of his struggle with the Balrog at the [[Endless Stair]] - those allow Galadriel to discern that Mithrandir is not truly dead. Players later meet him as Gandalf the White in [[Caras Galadhon]] shortly after the Fellowship has departed Lothlorien. During that time, he engages into a spiritual battle with a Gaunt-Lord Gortheron the Doom-Caller; his display of his new abilities encourages the band of Free People players and allows them to defeat the servant of Sauron.

:Gandalf is also present in several historic "session plays", during which players witness the important events their characters were not present for. Such events include Gandalf infiltrating [[Dol Guldur]] with the help of an Elf named Raddir, first meeting between Gandalf and Aragorn on the outskirts of Lothlorien and Gandalf's imprisonment atop Orthanc by Saruman.

'''2009: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Conquest]]'':'''
:[[Martin Jarvis]] provides the voice of Gandalf. He is a playable mage hero and has three special powers: "Healing Wisdom", "You Shall not Pass!" and "Cleansing Fire". In the good campaign he appears at the end of the Isengard mission, where he has to kill Saruman in [[Orthanc]]. In Moria he can be played to destroy the [[Balrog]] and in Minas Tirith he has to defend the gates of the second ring. He is also one of the four playable heroes in the last mission, [[The Battle of the Morannon|the battle of the Black Gate]]. He appears as well at the end of the last mission, the Shire, of the evil campaign, in which he is defeated by [[Sauron]].
:He is also playable in the Shire, Isengard, Minas Tirith and Moria with the ''Conquest'' Mode, in Isengard and Minas Tirith in the ''Team Deathmatch'' mode, the citadel of Minas Tirith in ''Capture the Ring'' mode, and at the Black Gate, Minas Morgul, Mount Doom and the Shire during ''Hero Team Deathmatch'' mode.

'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''
:Gandalf is voiced by [[Tom Kane]], who also narrates the introduction of the game. He tells that heroes like "[[Aragorn|Aragorn the King]]", "[[Frodo Baggins|Frodo the Ringbearer]]" and "'''Gandalf the Wizard'''" are rightly honoured, but that without a few heroes - [[Eradan (video game character)|Eradan]], [[Andriel]] and [[Farin (video game character)|Farin]] - the north of [[Middle-earth]] would have been lost.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], ''Prologue''</ref>
:He also appears in [[Rivendell]] later in the game. Players can interact with him and learn of various important events, yet the conversations do not unlock any side-quests and do not affect the main story in any way.

'''2012: ''[[Guardians of Middle-earth]]'':'''
:Gandalf is a mage-type "guardian" with four abilities: ''Narya's Power'', ''Flame of Anor'', ''Fireworks'' and ''Gandalf's Might''.<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://www.guardiansofmiddleearth.co.uk/guardians/gandalf|articlename=''Guardians of Middle-earth'': Gandalf|dated=|website=[http://www.guardiansofmiddleearth.com/ ''Guardians of Middle-earth'' official website]|accessed=16 July 2012}}</ref>

'''2025: ''[[Tales of the Shire: A "The Lord of the Rings" Game]]'':'''
:At the beginning of the game, Gandalf rides in his cart and discovers the player [[Hobbits|Hobbit]], sleeping on a log. He wakes them and helps them up, giving them a ride in his cart to [[Bywater]]. He gives the Hobbit [[Bilbo Baggins]]' map of Bywater and begins to depart. The Hobbit asks him his name and he tells them "[[An Unexpected Party|I am Gandalf, and Gandalf means me.]]" before farewelling them and continuing on the road.
