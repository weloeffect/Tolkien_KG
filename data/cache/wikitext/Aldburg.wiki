:Aldburg is the capital town of the [[Eastfold]], ruled by Éomer in times of peace. After Éomer departed for war, the defence of Aldburg fell to his steward Arcil, who often  disagreed with Éomer's cousin, [[Éothain]].

Aldburg serves as the in-game "capital settlement" of the West Rohan region, functioning as the hub for swift travel and player activities after [[Edoras]] is evacuated early in the game and its inhabitants move to [[Dunharrow]].
