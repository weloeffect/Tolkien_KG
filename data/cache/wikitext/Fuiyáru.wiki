'''Fuiyáru''' was a deadly nightshade that grew about the [[Halls of Mandos|courts of Mandos]] in the early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''. It is said to have been particularly abundant before the doors of [[Nienna|Fui]].<ref name=PE15>{{PE|15}}, p. 14</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Fuiyáro'' is [[Qenya]], likely a literal translation of "nightshade". Its composition probably relates to the elements ''Fui''/''hui'' ("fog, dark, murk, night")  + ''yaru''/''yara'' ("gloom, blight"). The [[Gnomish]] name of the flower was '''''Fuior'''''.<ref name=PE15/>

==Inspiration==
[[Patrick H. Wynne]] has identified the flower as the [[Wikipedia:Atropa belladonna|''Atropa belladonna'']].<ref name=PE15/>
