{{quote|Eärnur was a man like his father in valour, but not in wisdom. He was a man of strong body and hot mood; but he would take no wife, for his only pleasure was in fighting, or in the exercise of arms.|''[[Appendix A]]'', "Gondor and the Heirs of Anárion"}}

'''Eärnur''' ({{TA|1928|n}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, manuscript C, The Southern Line of Gondor: the Anarioni, 33. Eärnur</ref> – {{TA|2050|n}}<ref name="South">{{App|South}}, ''Kings of Gondor'', Eärnur, p. 1039</ref>) was the thirty-third and last [[Kings of Gondor|King of Gondor]]<ref name="South" />. He took the throne upon the death of his father [[Eärnil II]] in {{TA|2043}}<ref>{{App|South}}, ''Kings of Gondor'', Eärnil II, p. 1039</ref>, and after his disappearance, the [[Stewards of Gondor]] ruled in his name for many generations<ref name="South" />.

==History==
Eärnur had great courage like his father, but did not possess his father's wisdom. He had a strong body and a hot mood. He did not marry, because fighting was his only pleasure. Nobody in Gondor could defeat him in the weapon-sports in which he took pleasure. Eärnur seemed more like a champion than a captain or king. He retained his vigour and skill to a later age than was then usual.<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Eärnur, p. 1052</ref>

===Angmar===
During the [[Angmar War]], what was left of the ancient realm of [[Arnor]] was under attack. While not ignoring the North-Kingdom, King [[Eärnil II]] had trouble of his own, and could not spare any of his troops to send North. Upon learning that the Witch-king was preparing for the final blow in {{TA|1973}}, he sent his son Prince Eärnur north, as [[Captain of Gondor]]. Though his fleet sailed rapidly, he was not in time to save [[Arthedain]] or [[Arvedui]], its last king. His massive fleet - so large it filled [[Grey Havens|Mithlond]], [[Harlond (Lindon)|Harlond]] and [[Forlond]] - was hailed by the Men that had survived the last defeat, and the [[Elves of Lindon|Elves]] also. To Gondor's standards, the expeditionary force was mediocre in size. It did, however, include cavalry from  [[Rhovanion]], which would prove useful on the wide lands of the North.

With [[Círdan]], Eärnur travelled East, and cleansed the lands of Orcs and other servants of Angmar. All fled before the might of the [[Host of the West (Arnor)|Host of the West]], with Eärnur at its head. At the same time, [[Glorfindel]] came west from [[Rivendell]] and they [[Battle of Fornost|fought against Angmar]] at [[Fornost]]. When finally the Witch-king, clad in black, came forth near the site, many of the horses fled in terror. The Witch-king challenged Eärnur directly, but as he charged, his steed also swerved, and it took some time before the Captain of Gondor could regain control. The Witch-king laughed at this seeming retreat, but his victory would not last long. The Elves of Rivendell entered the battlefield, and the Witch-king fled before the [[Light of Valinor|might]] of Glorfindel. Fleeing in despair, Eärnur wanted to pursue him, but Glorfindel spoke against it: "''Do not pursue him! He will not return to this land. Far off yet is his doom, and not by the hand of man will he fall''".<ref name="Appendix">{{App|A1iv}}</ref>

But nonetheless, Eärnur bore a grudge against the wraith that disgraced him, and so he won the chief hatred of the Witch-king.

===Kingship===
It was soon found out that the Witch-king escaped to [[Mordor]], and set up abode in Minas Ithil, which in consequence was renamed [[Minas Morgul]]. After the death of Eärnil and the coronation of Eärnur, the Witch-king challenged him to single combat, reminding him of the disgrace in the North. The [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward]], [[Mardil|Mardil Voronwë]], persuaded him not to go.<ref name="Appendix" />

Seven years later, the Witch-king renewed his challenge, and this time, Eärnur could not be held back. Before leaving, however, Eärnur left [[Crown of Gondor|his crown]] on the lap of his father in the [[Hallows|Houses of the Dead]].<ref name="Appendix" /> There it was picked up again by [[Faramir]], the last Ruling Steward, for the coronation of [[Aragorn|Elessar]] almost a millennium later.<ref>{{RK|Steward}}</ref> With a small escort of knights, he rode past the gates of Minas Morgul. None were ever seen again.<ref name="Appendix" /> 

No new king was elected and the rule of Gondor passed to the [[Ruling Stewards]], beginning with Mardil Voronwë. The Stewards were to rule "until the King returns", because it was uncertain at first whether Eärnur had been killed or not. In addition, Eärnur left without an heir, and while many others in Gondor could lay some sort of claim to the kingship, those claims generally had some sort of doubt, and no one wanted to risk another civil war like the [[Kin-strife]].<ref name="Appendix" /><ref>{{S|V}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Eärnur'' is a [[Quenya]] name<ref>{{PE|17}}, entry Q ''Eärnur'', p. 88</ref> that is a shortened form of the name ''[[Eärendur]]''<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, entry ''-ndur''</ref><ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, root '''EL''', p. 152</ref>. It means "(professional) mariner".<ref>{{L|297|118}}</ref> As Paul Strack explains, a more literal translation might be "Servant of the Sea". It is a compound of [[eär]] ("sea") and [[-ndur|-(n)dur]] ("servant").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-2251744941.html|articlename=Q. ''Eärnur'' m.|website=Eldamo|accessed=17 January 2025}}</ref>

==Genealogy==
Eärnur was a member of the "fifth line" of Kings of Gondor, which started with his father after the death [[Ondoher]] and his sons in {{TA|1944}}, and ended with himself a little over a century later.

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In an earlier version of what would later become the chapter [[The Window on the West]] the last king of the line of [[Anárion]] was not called ''King Eärnur'', but was called '''King Elessar'''.<ref>{{WR|2|V}}, p. 153</ref>

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:While explaining the origin of the [[Oathbreakers|Dead Men]] to [[Gimli]] (and by extension, the audience), [[Legolas]] refers to [[Isildur]] as the "Last King".<ref>''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', "[[Dwimorberg - The Haunted Mountain]]"</ref> Whether Eärnur was omitted on purpose (so not to introduce another name) or simply overlooked is unknown.

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':''' 
:Eärnur appeared in the expansion pack, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king|The Rise of the Witch-king]]''. He came to Rivendell to aid the Elves and Men of Arnor.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Eärnur plays a major role in the game as the chief antagonist of several story-lines and is also combined with the character of [[Gothmog (Lieutenant of Morgul)|Gothmog]]. In the game, in [[Minas Morgul]] he was transformed into a [[Wraiths|wraith]] named '''Mordirith''' in service of the [[Witch-king]], who in mockery of the [[Stewards of Gondor]] made Mordirith his own Steward of [[Carn Dûm]] in [[Angmar]]. Long absent from it, Mordirith returns to Carn Dûm shortly before [[War of the Ring]], launching attacks against the Free Peoples of [[Eriador]]. Mordirith is defeated at the end of the game's original storyline, plunging the other servants of [[Sauron]] into a civil war over his position before he returns and his identity is revealed at the end of ''Volume I''. He is defeated again, but instead of being sent back to the North he is named '''Gothmog''' and is ordered to lead the Witch-King's armies against [[Gondor]].

:During the [[Battle of Pelennor Fields]] Gothmog personally kills the Ranger [[Halbarad]], but afterwards suddenly feels fear again and flees the battlefield before [[Aragorn]]. Gothmog barricades himself inside Minas Morgul, refusing even Sauron's muster to the Black Gate. Though he outlives the Dark Lord's demise, his other surviving servants blame Gothmog for it and combine their forces to assault of the City of the Dead. This gives the players and a group of [[Rangers of Ithilien]] the opportunity to sneak inside and challenge Gothmog, delivering a final defeat to him.
