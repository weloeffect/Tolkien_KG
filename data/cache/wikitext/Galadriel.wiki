'''Galadriel''' was a [[Noldor]]in Lady who witnessed [[Middle-earth]] during the Three [[Ages]]. 

Galadriel was born in [[Aman]] as one of the [[Noldor]]. She was the daughter of [[Finarfin]] and [[Eärwen]] as well as younger sister to [[Finrod|Finrod Felagund]] (later [[King of Nargothrond]]), [[Angrod]], and [[Aegnor]]. She took part in the [[Exile of the Noldor]], following [[Fëanor]] in his rebellion. However, she opposed the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë]] and crossed the [[Helcaraxë]] with the rest of [[Fingolfin]]'s followers. After arriving in [[Beleriand]], she lived mainly in [[Doriath]], where she befriended [[Melian]]. Later, with her husband [[Celeborn]], she ruled over the [[Silvan Elves|woodland Elves]] of [[Lothlórien]], and together they had a daughter, [[Celebrían]], who married [[Elrond]]. 

She is described as "the mightiest and fairest of all the Elves that remained in [[Middle-earth]]",<ref name="Rings">{{S|Rings}}</ref> and the "greatest of Elven women".<ref>{{App|B1}}, p. 1082</ref> Throughout the Third Age it was unknown who wielded the [[Three Rings]],<ref name="Third">{{App|TA}}, pp. 1085-8</ref> but during the [[War of the Ring]], Galadriel revealed to [[Frodo Baggins]] that she was the bearer of [[Nenya]].<ref name="Mirror">{{FR|Mirror}}</ref>{{rp|365}} After the War, she returned to the [[Uttermost West]].

==History==
===Elder Days===
====Life in Aman====
{{Seealso|#Other versions of the legendarium|l1=Other versions of the legendarium}}
Galadriel was born in [[Eldamar]] in the [[Year of the Trees 1362]].<ref>{{MR|P2l}}, p. 106</ref> She was the fourth child of [[Finarfin]], prince of the [[Noldor]], who named her '''''Artanis'''''.<ref name="Finwe">{{PM|Finwe}}, pp. 346-7</ref> Her mother was [[Eärwen]], princess of the [[Falathrim|Teleri]], who named her '''''Nerwen''''' ("Man-maiden"). Galadriel grew beautiful and tall, even for the women of the Noldor, being strong of body, will, and mind, "a match for both the [[loremasters]] and the athletes of the [[Eldar]] in the days of their youth."<ref name="Case">{{PM|Case}}, pp. 337-8</ref> 
[[File:Marya Filatova - Galadriel.jpg|left|thumb|''Galadriel'' by [[Marya Filatova]]]]
Indeed, "she was then of Amazon disposition and bound up her hair as a crown when taking part in athletic feats". This custom was the origin of her [[Sindarin]] [[Epessë|name]] '''''Galadriel''''' ("Maiden crowned with gleaming hair"),<ref name="Amazon">{{L|348}}, p. 428</ref> which was given to (and accepted by) her much later, in [[Beleriand]].<ref>{{NM|P3xvi}}, p. 352, note 8</ref> The gleaming of her hair was not a mere poetic reference: [[Hair of Galadriel|her hair]] was held a marvel unmatched. It mingled and surpassed the gold hair of her father and the starlike silver of her mother, so the Eldar said that both [[light]]s of the [[Two Trees]] were captured in her tresses. It was also said that this first gave the idea to her uncle [[Fëanor]] of capturing the merged light of the Trees, which would result in the making of the [[Silmarils]]. He asked her three times for one of her tresses, but she always refused. Fëanor and Galadriel were always unfriends, both being the greatest Eldar in Valinor; and if Fëanor was greater than she, she was wiser, and her wisdom grew with the long years. For she also had an outstanding gift to see into the minds of others, and, though she judged most with kindness, she hated and feared the darkness in Fëanor, not perceiving that the shadow of the same evil had fallen upon the minds of all the Noldor, including her own.<ref name="Case" />

There was still bliss in Valinor when she was born, but soon she was influenced by the [[Of the Silmarils and the Unrest of the Noldor|unrest of the Noldor]] and lost her inner peace ever after. She was proud, like most of the [[House of Finwë]], and like her closest brother [[Finrod]], "she had dreams of far lands and dominions that might be her own to order as she would without tutelage". But deep in herself, she had the noble spirit of the [[Vanyar]], which did not allow her to forget the reverence for the [[Valar]].<ref name="Case" />

During the [[Darkening of Valinor]] and the rebellion of Fëanor, Galadriel was the only woman of the Noldor who stood among the rising princes. She swore no [[Oath of Fëanor|oath]], but the [[Speech of Fëanor|words of Fëanor]] concerning [[Middle-earth]] kindled a desire in her heart, as she was eager to see those wide unguarded lands and rule a realm of her own.<ref name="Flight">{{S|Flight}}</ref> Like the rest of the [[House of Finarfin]], she was also supportive of the [[Exile of the Noldor|Exile]] by the desire to aid their [[Sindar]]in relatives in Middle-earth.<ref name="Case" /> 

Even though she was one of the leaders in this revolt,<ref name="RGEO">{{RGEO|Notes}}, p. 60</ref> during the troubles that followed she fought fiercely against Fëanor by defending her mother's kin during the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë]] and the rape of the ships. Afterwards, she even desired to follow Fëanor to disturb him in all the ways that she could, but nothing could have moved her to return since she had begun her way to exile, as her pride was strong then as it was thereafter.<ref name="Case" /> She kept moving forward even under the [[Doom of Mandos]], when her father Finarfin abandoned the march and returned to Valinor, and even when Fëanor left behind the hosts of Fingolfin and the children of Finarfin. Then she, along with Finrod and [[Fingolfin]] and his sons, led her people into the bitter North and crossed the terrors of [[Helcaraxë]]. After many losses, they arrived on the northern shores of the [[Outer Lands]].<ref name="Flight" /><ref group="note">The nature of Galadriel's exile (if she was innocent or guilty of pride) and the subsequent idea of a ban upon her return were not defined in Tolkien's first conceptions of Galadriel, so she being a rebel exile was a later reinterpretation. He would also change his mind about it, but for this article we chose this version for having the most complete narratives. For a more complete account of this matter, see the entire ''[[#Other versions of the legendarium]]''.</ref>

====Arrival to Middle-earth====
[[File:Līga Kļaviņa - Love at First Sight.jpg|thumb|''Love at First Sight'' by [[:Category:Images by Līga Kļaviņa|Līga Kļaviņa]]]]
Once in [[Beleriand]], those of the House of Finarfin were eager to enter [[Doriath]], but King [[Elu Thingol]] received the Noldor coldly, and only allowed entrance to those invited by him after some inquiries.<ref name="Return">{{S|13}}</ref> Finally in {{FA|52}},<ref>{{GA|74}}</ref> Finrod and Galadriel became long guests in Doriath, but her brother eventually departed to the [[Caverns of Narog]] to establish the stronghold of [[Nargothrond]]. Galadriel did not go with him, and remained in Doriath with [[Celeborn]], a kinsman of Thingol, as there was great love between them.<ref name="Noldor">{{S|15}}</ref> Despite their love, they did not marry each other, following the [[Elven life cycle|custom among the Eldar]] of avoiding marriage and child-bearing during the war,<ref name="Scales">{{NM|P1ix}}, pp. 65-6</ref> but they were eventually betrothed till the war ended.<ref name="Ages">{{NM|P1xviii}}, p. 149</ref> Meanwhile, she dwelt with Queen [[Melian]], from whom she learned much of the wisdom of Middle-earth.<ref name="Return" />

The Western Corn necessary to make [[lembas]] had been lost in Beleriand until the Noldor brought new grain back, and it flourished by the grace of the Valar. Galadriel was one of the main inheritors of it and of the art of the making of lembas.<ref>{{NM|P3iv}}, p. 296</ref> It is safe to assume Melian benefited from this.

Years passed in Doriath, and Galadriel became dear to Melian, and they spoke often to one another about Valinor. Melian was eager to learn the causes of the [[Exile of the Noldor]], but Galadriel would tell her nothing of what occurred after the death of the Trees. In the year {{FA|66|n}},<ref>{{GA|91}}</ref> Melian asked her directly about this, and Galadriel revealed the story of the [[Silmarils]] and how the Noldor fled from Aman against the will of the Valar, though she still left out the Oath of Fëanor, the Kinslaying, and the burning of the Ships at [[Losgar]]. Melian was able to discern a darkness that was left unsaid, but Galadriel refused to tell her more. Thus, Thingol became concerned regarding the Noldor, and he was informed soon afterwards of the Noldor's dark deeds in Aman, and it chanced that the children of Finarfin were visiting Galadriel in Doriath. Egged on by his accusing words, [[Angrod]] told everything, and Galadriel's brothers departed heavy-hearted.<ref name="Noldor" />
[[File:Ten Thousand Leaves - Galadriel and Melian.jpeg|thumb|left|''Galadriel and Melian'' by [[:Category:Images by Ten Thousand Leaves|Ten Thousand Leaves]]]]
Despite all this, Galadriel stayed in Doriath until {{FA|102|n}},<ref name="Nargothrond">{{GA|108}}</ref> when the kingdom of [[Nargothrond]] was finished and a feast was held for all the children of Finarfin. She dwelt for a while in Nargothrond, and in this time she asked Finrod why he remained unmarried. Her brother answered with dark [[foresight]]s about his kingdom.<ref name="Noldor" /> Back in Doriath, in {{FA|420|n}},<ref>{{GA|129}}</ref> Galadriel heard another foretelling, as Melian told her about [[Beren|a Man]] who shall cross into Doriath moved by a doom greater than the [[Girdle of Melian]].<ref>{{S|17}}</ref>

Galadriel did not have any significant role in the general course of events in the [[Battles of Beleriand|War of the Jewels]], but she might have been well informed of the deaths of her brothers [[Angrod]] and [[Aegnor]] during the [[Dagor Bragollach]]; and of Finrod's, while he was held in captivity by [[Sauron]] in the year {{FA|465|n}}.<ref>{{GA|§198-199}}</ref> At some point before the [[Fall of Nargothrond]] in {{FA|495|n}},<ref>{{GA|275}}</ref> she and Celeborn passed over [[Blue Mountains|the mountains]]<ref name="Mirror" />{{rp|357}} to [[Eriador]], far from the turmoil of the last years of the [[First Age]].

After the [[War of Wrath]] at the end of the [[First Age]], [[Eönwë]], herald of [[Manwë]], summoned the [[Elves of Beleriand]] to the West, so they were received in [[Tol Eressëa]] and under the pardon of the Valar. However, some did not wish to leave Middle-earth, such as Celeborn.<ref name="Earendil">{{S|24}}</ref> Being one of the chief leaders of the Noldorin rebellion, Galadriel was not allowed to return<ref name="L|297">{{L|297}}, p. 386</ref> and a ban was set upon her, to which she replied that she had no wish to do so.<ref name="RGEO" /> The same pride that led her out of Aman still moved her, and she rejected the pardon of the Valar,<ref name="Case" /> for as she had once lived in Aman itself, Eressëa seemed only a "second best". She was also moved by love for Celeborn, to whom she probably married around this time.<ref name="Scales" /><ref group="note">The marriage of Galadriel and Celeborn, as well as when they crossed over the mountains, was not well defined by Tolkien. See ''[[#Unsolved contradictions]]''.</ref>

===Second Age===
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Galadriel and Celeborn at Lake Evendim.jpg|thumb|''Galadriel and Celeborn at Lake Evendim'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
At the beginning of the Second Age, Celeborn and Galadriel dwelt for a time in [[Lindon]], south of the [[Lune]], while [[Gil-galad]] ruled in the north.<ref name="Second">{{App|B1}}, pp. 1082-4</ref> Both left Lindon before the years 10-20, when [[Gil-galad]] became king in that land, apparently thanks to her influence.<ref>{{NM|P1xi}}, p. 81</ref> They entered [[Eriador]] and dwelt for a while around [[Lake Nenuial]], being followed by many Noldor, [[Grey-elves]] and [[Green-elves]]. They were considered the Lord and Lady of the Eldar in Eriador.<ref name="Concerning">{{UT|Concerning}}</ref>{{rp|234}} Probably around {{SA|300}},<ref group="note">The birth-year of Celebrían was not well defined by Tolkien. See ''[[#Unsolved contradictions]]''.</ref> Galadriel and Celeborn had a daughter: [[Celebrían]].<ref name="Scales" />

Circa the year {{SA|500|n}}, [[Sauron]] began to stir in Middle-earth again,<ref name="Second" /> but his name was not known. He was, however, perceived by Galadriel, who noticed there was a controlling evil, and that it was spreading above the world, coming from the East beyond the [[Misty Mountains]]. She also thought this 'residue of evil' could only be fought with an alliance of all its enemies. Therefore, she and Celeborn moved eastwards and got established in the realm of [[Eregion]] near [[Khazad-dûm]].<ref group="note">In the source used here, Galadriel and Celeborn are described as the first founders of Eregion, but later sources mention Celebrimbor as founder and lord of Eregion before their coming. See ''[[#Unsolved contradictions]]''.</ref> Celeborn was not fond of [[Dwarves]], but she saw the importance of getting close to them, for she saw military interests even with them. Also, she was a Noldo, and therefore close to them in mind and in the passion for crafts; and in Valinor she had learned from [[Yavanna]] and [[Aulë]], the creator of the Dwarves himself.<ref name="Concerning" />{{rp|235}} 

Some Noldor were also interested in establishing a realm near Khazad-dûm because they knew [[mithril]] had been discovered there. Therefore, many Elven-smiths came to Eregion and created good relations with the Dwarves. [[Celebrimbor]], a descendant of [[Fëanor]] (and therefore a distant cousin of Galadriel), was the greatest of the craft-men and the Lord of Eregion.<ref name="Second" /> He was its main builder and in {{SA|750|n}} [[Ost-in-Edhil]], the main city of the realm, was begun. The power of Galadriel and Celeborn also grew: thanks to the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, they had contact with the [[Nandor]]in realm of [[Lórinand]], on the other side of the Misty Mountains. Thanks to Galadriel's influence upon Lórinand, Sauron's machinations there were fruitless.<ref name="Concerning" />{{rp|236}} She also got in contact with [[Númenor]], having a meeting with King [[Aldarion]] when he came to [[Tharbad]] around {{SA|883|n}}-884.<ref>{{UT|4}}, ''The further course of the narrative'', pp. 205-6</ref>
[[File:Alan Lee - Galadriel in Moria.jpg|thumb|''Galadriel in Moria'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]
About the year {{SA|1200|n}}, Sauron came in disguise to Eriador, but he was only welcomed in Eregion by Celebrimbor and the Elven-smiths, who were interested in his advice on craftsmanship.<ref name="Concerning" />{{rp|236}} Galadriel was not deceived, and rejected him, saying that he was not in the training of Aulë as he claimed.<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}, "Notes", p. 254, note 7</ref> "''He perceived at once that Galadriel would be his chief adversary and obstacle, and he endeavoured therefore to placate her, bearing her scorn with outward patience and courtesy''". At the same time, without her knowledge, Sauron influenced Celebrimbor and his [[Gwaith-i-Mírdain]] against Galadriel and Celeborn. Finally, he moved them to expell Galadriel from Eregion at some time between {{SA|1350|n}} and 1400.<ref group="note">As in the previous note, the source used here presents Celebrimbor as a subordinate of Galadriel and Celeborn, so in this episode he leads a coup against them.</ref> Thus, Galadriel and Celebrían left through Khazad-dûm to Lórinand, although Celeborn would not enter the Dwarvish realm and remained in Eregion.<ref name="Concerning" />{{rp|237}}

When Sauron made [[the One Ring]] in {{SA|1600}}, his treachery was discovered by Celebrimbor.<ref name="Second" /> The elven-smith came to Lórinand, seeking counsel from Galadriel. They did not find the strength to destroy the [[Rings of Power]], but she advised him to hide the [[Three Rings]] of the Elves where Sauron could not find them. Therefore he gave her [[Nenya]], the White Ring, and the other Rings were given to other Elven lords.<ref name="Concerning" />{{rp|237}} This was done in {{SA|1693|n}}, the same year Sauron began [[War of the Elves and Sauron|the war against the Elves]].<ref name="Second" />

With the invasion of Eriador, [[Sack of Eregion|Eregion was destroyed]] and Celebrimbor killed. Despite using torture, Sauron could not learn from him where the Elven Rings were, although he suspected they were kept by Galadriel and Gil-galad.<ref name="Concerning" />{{rp|238}} But thanks to the military intervention of [[Númenor]], Sauron was defeated in {{SA|1700|n}}.<ref name="Second" /> Soon afterwards, Galadriel was affected by [[sea-longing]], and she decided to leave Lórinand and dwell beside the sea.<ref name="Concerning" />{{rp|240}} As one of the [[High-elves]], her yearning for the sea was unavoidable, and now she became burdened with the desire to cross to the Blessed Realm, but the ban upon her impeded it.<ref name="RGEO" /> Thus she did not go to the sea yet, but crossed west of the mountains through Khazad-dûm with Celebrían. Seeking Celeborn, they travelled to [[Imladris]], a refuge created by [[Elrond]] during the war. Once there, a [[White Council|Council]] was held, in which it was decided that Imladris would be the Elvish stronghold in the East, rather than the desolate Eregion.<ref name="Concerning" />{{rp|239–40}}

Galadriel, Celeborn and Celebrían dwelt a long time in Imladris, but at some point they left and moved near the sea, to [[Belfalas]], at the place later known as [[Dol Amroth]]. There were few inhabitants there, but they were visited by Nandorin parties.<ref name="Concerning" />{{rp|238}} Apparently, they returned to Lórien twice before the [[Last Alliance]] and the end of the Second Age,<ref name="Amroth">{{UT|Amroth}}, pp. 243-5</ref> but of their whereabouts during the final millennia of that Age nothing else is known.

===Third Age===
====Rule in Lórien====
In early [[Third Age]], in the year {{TA|109|n}}, Galadriel and Celeborn's daughter [[Celebrían]] wedded [[Elrond]] the [[Half-elven]].<ref name="Third" /> But they did not stay at first with her, for Galadriel was filled with [[Foresight|foreboding]], and was concerned about the growing shadow in [[Mirkwood]] and [[Dol Guldur]]. Therefore she and Celeborn made long journeys investigating [[Rhovanion]], going from [[Gondor]] and the borders of [[Mordor]] to [[Thranduil]] in the north. They also stayed a long time in Lórien with king [[Amroth]], for Galadriel saw with her wisdom that this prosperous realm could be a stronghold against the growing Shadow, if it had better rule.<ref name="Amroth" /> At this point, the [[Istari]] arrived in Middle-earth, and only Galadriel, Elrond and [[Círdan]] knew [[Valinor|where]] they came from.<ref name="Rings" /> Around the year {{TA|1100|n}}, the [[Wise]] (including Galadriel as one the chief Eldar) were well aware of the evil dwelling in Dol Guldur, but thought it was one of the [[Nazgûl]].<ref name="Third" />

After their enquiries, Galadriel and Celeborn passed over the mountains to Imladris, and there dwelt for many years with their kin.<ref name="Amroth" />

Between the years {{TA|1980}}-{{TA|1981|n}}, [[Durin's Bane|a terror]] appeared in Khazad-dûm and the Dwarves abandoned the realm, while the many Silvan Elves from Lórien had to flee south.<ref name="Third" /> To make things worse, Amroth was lost, leaving no heir, and the Elven realm was left without a ruler. Therefore Celeborn and Galadriel went there, welcomed by the people, and took up the rule jointly, but refused to take the [[King of Lórien|royal title]] and were called the [[Lord and Lady of Galadhrim]]. Saving the realm from the perils of the moment, they dwelt and ruled permanently there.<ref name="Amroth" />

As the shadow of Dol Guldur grew again, the [[White Council]] was formed in {{TA|2463|n}}.<ref name="Third" /> It was summoned by Galadriel,<ref>{{FR|II7}}, p. 357</ref> who, being a good friend of [[Gandalf]], recommended that he be made head of the Council. But this distinction fell instead to [[Saruman]].<ref name="Rings" /> 

In {{TA|2510|n}}, her daughter Celebrían departed to the West after being wounded by Orcs.<ref name="Third" /> The same year, she aided [[Eorl]] and his [[Rohirrim|riders]] in the [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant]], creating a white mist that drove out the shadows from Dol Guldur.<ref>{{UT|8b}}, pp. 298-9</ref>

The White Council would not take action until Gandalf discovered that the shadow growing in Dol Guldur was [[Sauron]]. After deliberating, the Council joined forces and drove Sauron out of Dol Guldur in {{TA|2941|n}}.<ref name="Third" />

Some years later, [[Aragorn]] entered Lothlórien after many travels, and was admitted by Galadriel. She bade him change his worn-out clothes and dressed him like a proper prince. At that time, Aragorn became betrothed to her granddaughter [[Arwen]].<ref>{{App|A1v}}, p. 1060</ref>

====War of the Ring====
[[File:Ralph Damiani - The Trial.png|thumb|right|''The Trial'' by [[:Category:Images by Ralph Damiani|Ralph Damiani]]]]
Galadriel and Celeborn were well informed about the [[Company of the Ring]], its members and their mission, before its coming to Lothlórien, perhaps informed by messages from Rivendell.<ref>{{FR|II6}}, p. 350</ref> In the evening of [[17 January]] of {{TA|3019}}, the Company arrived at [[Caras Galadhon]].<ref name="Great">{{App|B3}}, pp. 1092-4</ref> Coming to the [[talan]] of the Lady and Lord, each member was greeted by name by Celeborn. Noticing that Gandalf was missing, Galadriel asked where he was, for she wished to speak with him. Hearing that they had encountered [[Durin's Bane]] and that this was in fact a [[Balrog]] from ancient times, Celeborn criticized the passing of the Company through Moria. However, Galadriel was more sympathetic, especially towards [[Gimli]], who bowed to her in respect. Before inviting the members of the Company to rest and heal there, she looked deep into their eyes and they all felt their hearts exposed.<ref name="Mirror" />{{rp|354–7}}

A month later, in [[15 February]],<ref name="Great" /> [[Frodo Baggins]] the [[Ringbearer|bearer of the One Ring]], was walking in the evening with [[Sam]] when they encountered Galadriel. She led them to an enclosed garden and showed them a silver basin. Filling it with water, a [[Mirror of Galadriel|Mirror]] was formed, which allowed them to see things that were and that might come. Frodo saw the [[Eye of Sauron]], and she explained that she knew well Frodo's mind, for Sauron also tried to look into hers. She also [[Keepers of the Three Rings|kept]] a [[Ring of Power]], and showing him [[Nenya]], the Ring of Adamant, she explained that its power would disappear once Frodo destroyed the One, and Lórien would fade. Then Frodo offered the One Ring to her, and she laughed in response, saying: "''I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired to ask what you offer.''" Then she began to ponder how powerful she would become with the Ring's power, and from Nenya came a great light that covered her overwhelming height. But the light faded and she laughed again, saying: "''I pass the test. I will diminish, and go into the West, and remain Galadriel''."<ref name="Mirror" />{{rp|360–6}} Indeed, with this rejection of temptation and her long opposition against Sauron, the ban upon her return to Aman was finally lifted.<ref name="RGEO" />

That night, the Lord and Lady summoned the Company and spoke of their departure, which was appointed for the following morning. The next day, she sent the Fellowship off on their Quest, furnished with [[Gifts of Galadriel|gifts]] for all the members, including [[lembas]] and [[Elven cloaks]]. Later, a farewell party was held, which the Lord and Lady attended in a [[Swan-ships|swan boat]]; from it, Galadriel sang a [[Galadriel's Song|song]] about [[Eldamar]]. After everyone ate and drank, she proceed to give [[Gifts of Galadriel|specific gifts]] to each member.<ref name="Farewell">{{FR|II8}}, pp. 367-78</ref>

Among the gifts was the [[Elfstone]], which she gave to Aragorn from Arwen "''as a token of hope''".<ref name="Farewell" /> The jewel was also in part a bridal gift and a token of the future wedding of Arwen and Aragorn, done following the [[Elven customs|Noldorin custom]] in which the bride's mother should give to the bridegroom a jewel (Arwen's mother Celebrían had departed long ago, so Galadriel did it in her place).<ref>{{MR|P3II3}}, p. 211</ref> Galadriel stated she was unsure as to what to give Gimli, and asked what he wanted. After complimenting her beauty, he requested a single strand of [[Hair of Galadriel|her hair]]. Instead, she rewarded him with three strands, which he promised to put into an imperishable crystal in memory of her. And last, to Frodo, she gave a [[Phial of Galadriel|a small crystal phial]] specially prepared by her, which contained the [[Light of Valinor|light]] of the [[star of Eärendil]].<ref name="Farewell" />

The Company saw her one last time while sailing down to the [[Anduin]]: a shining figure, all clad in white, raising her arms, and Frodo was able to hear her clearly reciting [[Namárië|a long poem in Elvish]] despite the distance.<ref name="Farewell" />

On [[17 February|the following day]], a resurrected Gandalf was brought to Lórien by [[Gwaihir]],<ref name="Great" /> who was sent by Galadriel. He was received in Caras Galadhon, and was healed and clothed in white. He also took and gave counsel. Before he left, Galadriel gave him [[Galadriel's messages|some prophetic messages]] for Aragorn, [[Legolas]] and Gimli.<ref>{{TT|III5}}, pp. 502-3</ref>

The land of Lórien was not exempt from the battles of the [[War of the Ring]]: between [[11 March|11]] and [[18 March]], the [[Galadhrim]] suffered [[assaults on Lothlórien|three assaults]] from Dol Guldur.<ref name="Great" /> After the [[Fall of Barad-dûr]], Celeborn crossed the Anduin with a host and began the [[Fall of Dol Guldur|destruction of Dol Guldur]].<ref name="Chief">{{App|B4}}, pp. 1095-6</ref> Soon afterward, Galadriel threw down the walls of the fortress and opened its pits.<ref name="Great" />

====Later history====
[[File:Victoria Clare - On the Road to the Grey Havens.jpg|thumb|''On the Road to the Grey Havens'' by [[:Category:Images by Victoria Clare|Victoria Clare]]]]
Galadriel, Celeborn and their company attended the wedding of Aragorn and Arwen. Soon afterward they joined the crowded funeral riding of King [[Théoden]] to [[Rohan]]. After the funerals in the [[Golden Hall]], they continued their travel northwards with other companions and halted in [[Isengard]]. [[Treebeard]] reveals that he had freed Saruman, and regrets that he will not see Galadriel and [[Celeborn]] again. Celeborn replied that he is unsure but Galadriel affirmed that it would be her last meeting with him, giving Treebeard some [[Arda Healed|cryptic words]]. They continued on their way and encountered [[Saruman]], who, released by [[Fangorn]], snapped that she always had hated him, and now he would find comfort knowing that her realm was destroyed as well as his.<ref>{{RK|VI6}}, pp. 976, 983, 985</ref>

Two years later, on [[22 September]] {{TA|3021|n}},<ref name="Chief" /> Frodo and Sam encountered a [[Wandering Companies|Wandering Company]] while travelling around [[the Shire]], and found that Elrond, Galadriel and [[Bilbo]] were part of it. Nenya was visible on Galadriel's finger, and she seemed to shine like the moon. Frodo decided to depart with them and the hobbits joined the company, led by Elrond and Galadriel.<ref name="Havens">{{RK|VI9}}, pp. 1027-30</ref> On [[29 September]], they reached the [[Grey Havens]] and departed over the Sea. Thus ended the [[Third Age]].<ref name="Chief" />

Sometime later during the [[Fourth Age]], she received Celeborn, her husband.<ref>{{FR|Prologue}}, pp. 15-6</ref> And in {{FoA|120}},<ref>{{App|B5}}, p. 1098</ref> it is said that [[Gimli]] went to the West out of his desire to see Galadriel again. He may have been allowed thanks to her intervention.<ref>{{App|A3}}, p. 1081</ref>

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Galadriel.mp3|Ardamir}}
''Galadriel'' is a [[Sindarin]] name translated by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] as "maiden crowned with a garland of bright radiance",<ref name="Finwe" /> "Maiden crowned with gleaming hair",<ref name="Amazon" /> "glittering garland",<ref>{{L|345}}, p. 423</ref> and "maiden crowned with a radiant garland".<ref name="SApp">{{S|Appendix}}, ''kal-''</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, pp. 44-5</ref> ''Galadriel'' consists of ''[[galad]]'' ("light, radiance") + ''[[rî]]'' ("crown").<ref name="Finwe" /> It was an [[epessë]] given to her in her youth because, while doing exercise, she usually bound up her long golden hair as a crown.<ref name="Amazon">{{L|348}}, p. 428</ref>

Tolkien notes that the element ''galad'' had no relation to Sindarin ''[[galadh]]'' or [[Silvan]] ''galað'' ("tree").<ref name="SApp" /><ref>{{MR|P3I5}}, p. 182 (commentary to §42)</ref> Due to this coincidence the name ''Galadriel'' was occasionally rendered as '''''Galadhriel''''', as Tolkien explains:
{{blockquote|When Celeborn and Galadriel became the rulers of the <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Galadhrim]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>, the name of Galadriel became associated with trees, an association that was aided by the name of her husband, which also appeared to contain a tree-word; so that outside [[Lórien]] among those whose memories of the ancient days and Galadriel's history had grown dim her name was often altered to 'Galadhriel', though never in Lórien itself.<ref>{{UT|6e}}, p. 267</ref>}}

==Other names==
At the time of her birth, [[Finarfin]] named his only daughter '''''Artanis'''''. Her [[father-name]] meant "Noble Woman" in [[Quenya]], from ''[[arta]]'' + ''[[nís]]''.<ref name="Finwe" />

Due to Artanis's height and her great strength of body and will, Eärwen chose the [[Quenya]] name '''''Nerwen''''', meaning "man-maiden".<ref name="Case" />

'''''Alatáriel''''' was the [[Telerin]] name given to Galadriel by [[Celeborn]], meaning "Maiden Crowned with Radiant Garland", which referred to her hair.<ref name="Finwe" /> The Quenya form of this name was '''''Altáriel''''', although the proper form would have been '''''Ñaltariel'''''. Its [[Sindarin]] cognate '''''Galadriel''''' was chosen by her to be her Sindarin name, because it was the most beautiful of her names and had been given to her as an [[epessë]] by her lover, Teleporno of the Teleri, whom she wedded later in Beleriand.<ref name="Finwe" /><ref group="note">''Teleporno'' was the Teleri-styled named for Lord Celeborn: "It is only of course in the late version that Celeborn appears with a High-elven, rather than Sindarin, name: ''Teleporno''", {{UT|6e}}, p. 266</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
[[File:Alan Lee - Galadriel.jpg|thumb|''Galadriel sketch'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]
{{quote|There is no part of the history of Middle-earth more full of problems than the story of Galadriel and Celeborn...|[[Christopher Tolkien]] in "[[The History of Galadriel and Celeborn]]"}}

===The History of ''The Lord of the Rings''===
The first appearance of the character of Galadriel in the [[legendarium]] was during the composition of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. The first reference [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] ever made to her was in some notes for the "[[Lothlórien (chapter)|Lothlórien]]" chapter, which mentioned that a "Lord of Galadrim and a Lady" went to the White Council. The following phrases are a stub of them receiving the Company of the Ring, both clad in white and with white hair. In other isolated notes about this chapter, Tolkien wondered "if Galadriel is alone and is wife of Elrond."<ref>{{TI|XII}}, pp. 233, 236</ref>

The first mention of "Keleborn and Galadriel" by name was in the narrative of the [[The Mirror of Galadriel|following chapter]], although Tolkien considered other Elvish names before writing ''Galadriel'' in ink.<ref name="Galadriel">{{TI|XIII}}</ref>{{rp|261}} There Galadriel describes Keleborn and herself as "''wise beyond the measure of the Elves of Middle-earth''", and says that they "''have dwelt there since the Mountains were reared and the Sun was young''", from which [[Christopher Tolkien]] deduced they were both conceived as [[exiled Noldor]].<ref name="Galadriel" />{{rp|263}} After the episode with the Company, both names are changed, so she became ''Galadrien'' ("tree-lady") in the next pages.<ref name="Galadriel" />{{rp|249}} Other notable details that were altered later include the white colour of her hair,<ref name="Galadriel" />{{rp|256}} that she was the keeper of the [[Ring of Earth]],<ref name="Galadriel" />{{rp|252}} and that after the departure of the Company, Frodo was supposed to never see Galadriel ever again.<ref>{{TI|XIVviii}}, p. 286</ref>

In a list of matters "to be explained before the end", Tolkien wondered about what happened with Galadriel after the War of the Ring:

{{blockquote|They learn [...] that Nazgûl razed Lórien and Keleborn fled with a remnant to [[Mirkwood]]. Galadriel was lost or was hidden. Or shall Lórien be left slowly to fade? Yes. Galadriel parts with Keleborn who elects to stay in the world and [?woods]. She is seen by Frodo in old age, when he and Sam see Galadriel and Bilbo...<ref>{{TI|XXVI}}, p. 451, note 18</ref>}}

In sum, earlier and rejected names during the composition of ''The Lord of the Rings'' were ''Finduilas'', ''Rhien'', ''Galdrin'', ''Galdrien'', ''Galadhrien'', and ''Galadrien''.<ref>{{TI|Index}}, p. 480, entry "Galadriel"</ref>

===Expanding the First Age===
In the [[Appendix F]] of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien had already stated that Galadriel was "of the royal house of Finrod, father of Felagund, Lord of Nargothrond" (in the Second Edition, Tolkien changed the names to ''Finarfin'' and ''Finrod Felagund'', respectively). Although not using much detail, Tolkien was thus introducing Galadriel in "The Silmarillion" tradition, and having finished ''The Lord of the Rings'', he began the work of expanding the backstory of the character. Galadriel enters this tradition in the ''[[Annals of Aman]]'', in which she is first mentioned when Tolkien decided the children of Finrod (later Finarfin) would be related to Thingol through Eärwen.<ref>{{MR|P2l}}, p. 104, §85</ref> In the ''Annals'', written after the publication of ''The Lord of the Rings'',<ref>{{MR|P2}}, p. 48</ref> Galadriel stands out by being valiant and the only woman leading the Exile of the Noldor,<ref>{{AA|§135, 163}}</ref> but there is no explanation of the nature of her rebellion or its later impact on her life.

Indeed, [[Christopher Tolkien]] explains that when the chapter "Farewell to Lórien" was written, his father had not conceived the idea of a ban upon Galadriel's return due to her role in the Flight of the Noldor.<ref name="History">{{UT|6}}, pp. 228-9</ref> In a letter from [[1953]] (even before ''The Lord of the Rings'' was published), Tolkien did not object to the comparison of Galadriel with the [[Virgin Mary]],<ref>{{L|142}}, p. 172</ref> [[#Rebel exile|a comparison he would object]] to later. 

Written in the same years, the ''[[Grey Annals]]'' follow the ''Annals of Aman'', telling the chronology of Beleriand, mainly after the Return of the Noldor. Here Galadriel's rol is briefly expanded, limited to her relation with Melian and a conversation with her brother Finrod.<ref>{{WJ|P1}}, pp. 35, 40-2, 44, 50</ref> The darkness pending upon all the Noldor is explicitly mentioned, but the same happens with the innocence of the children of Finrod (later Finarfin) during the discussions with Thingol and Melian. Sadly, Tolkien left these ''Annals'' unfinished at the point of the [[Wanderings of Húrin]], so nothing is told about Galadriel at the end of the First Age, neither about her relation with Celeborn.<ref group="note">Notice that both ''Annals'' were (on the matter of Galadriel) the source used by Christopher Tolkien for his edition of the ''[[Quenta Silmarillion]]''. For more details see ''[[#The published Silmarillion]]''.</ref>

===Expanding the Second Age===
After the publication of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien most expanded the story of Galadriel in the Second Age in "[[Concerning Galadriel and Celeborn]]". This manuscript is the only full narrative dealing with this matter, but sadly it is a stub full of corrections, and Tolkien never solved some contradictions that would be raised later.<ref group="note">Notice that this text is the main source for the "[[#Second Age|Second Age]]" section of this article, in which the contradictions have been deliberately overlooked. For more details see ''[[#Unsolved contradictions]]''.</ref> Christopher comments that what is now remarkable is that there is still no presence of the idea of a ban upon Galadriel's return: she stays in Middle-earth out of her love for Celeborn. There could be some pride on her part, as she was eager to visit Middle-earth, but later she stays in Eriador after the first fall of Sauron as a sort of duty until he was finally defeated.<ref name="Concerning" />{{rp|233–4}}

The first clear mention of pride in Galadriel's decision is probably in one of many manuscripts written c. [[1959]] dealing with Elven growing. In this text it is briefly mentioned that Galadriel rejected coming back to the West and live in [[Eressëa]], moved by her love for Celeborn and (told in a footnote) maybe by her pride, as she had lived in Aman as a princess, so the Lonely Isle would be a "second best".<ref name="Scales" /> We see here that she was allowed to return to the West, but limited to Eressëa, far from the blessed lands (this is, Valinor and Eldamar). There is a sort of ban, not particularly against her, but her pride stands out, as it will become in an essential aspect of her character in the following "phase" of her development.

===Rebel exile===
In mid-[[1967]], Tolkien wrote long drafts of a letter, in which he first mentioned the idea of Galadriel not being allowed to return after the First Age as a punishment for being one of the leaders of the Noldor rebellion. Also, in a footnote, he interprets the ''[[Namárië]]'' as Galadriel's wish that Frodo might go West, as she cannot, believing she is to remain in Middle-earth forever. And more radically, Tolkien interprets the test of the Ring as granting Galadriel permission to return to Aman.<ref name="L|297" /> Christopher Tolkien does not believe that this letter is proof that the ban was present when such passages were written.<ref name="History" /> Given all this, we can well affirm that what is said in this letter are reinterpretations made a posteriori.

Just two months later, ''[[The Road Goes Ever On: A Song Cycle]]'' was published in the United States, in which Tolkien included a brief biography of Galadriel in notes to the ''Namárië''. Not only the Elvish poem, but the line "''What ship will carry me again across such a wide sea?''" of the poem mentioned above, are interpreted here as expressions of Galadriel's longing, unable to return to the West. Her arrogance is connected to her rebellious role, since she replied proudly to the prohibition by saying she had no desire to return.<ref name="RGEO" />

It is strange that Tolkien's new vision was so clear at this time, since there does not seem to be any intermediate text in which he considered this version or others. Now, he would go ahead with this vision, so it would also affect the character's background in the First Age.

Written in [[1968]] or later, ''[[The Shibboleth of Fëanor]]'' includes a long passage about Galadriel during her life in Aman and during the Exile. It is the first place that highlights her enmity with Fëanor before the Exile, and also her independence from him, since her desire to see and rule distant lands was already present in her before Fëanor's speech. Her role during the Flight of the Noldor is described as courageous and blameless: she had a legitimate desire to help her Teleri kin in Middle-earth, and she fought fiercely against Fëanor in the Kinslaying at Alqualondë. However, she is guilty of pride, not only in her departure, as here she is granted forgiveness after Morgoth's defeat, but she rejects it.<ref name="Case" />

A few years later, in [[1971]], we see that this conception of Galadriel still remains. In response to a letter, Tolkien acknowledges the influence of the figure of the Virgin Mary on the character of Galadriel, but now points out a radical difference: Galadriel was a penitent with a past marked by pride and rebellion against divine authorities.<ref>{{L|320}}, p. 407</ref>

===Unstained exile===
In a letter written in August [[1973]] (one month before his death), Tolkien gave a completely different description of Galadriel: 

{{blockquote|Galadriel was 'unstained': she had committed no evil deeds. She was an enemy of Fëanor. She did not reach Middle-earth with the other Noldor, but independently. Her reasons for desiring to go to Middle-earth were legitimate, and she would have been permitted to depart, but for the misfortune that before she set out the revolt of Fëanor broke out, and she became involved in the desperate measures of Manwë, and the ban on all emigrations.<ref>{{L|353}}, p. 431</ref>}}
[[File:Elena Kukanova - Artanis sketch.jpg|thumb|''Artanis'' by [[:Category:Images by Elena Kukanova|Elena Kukanova]]]]
This was not an isolated idea; around the same time he wrote an outline of the revised backstory of Galadriel, which he could not carry into narrative, as it ended up being probably his last writing related to the legendarium. Here Galadriel is described as totally opposed to Fëanor from the beginning, and she felt confined in Aman and desired to depart to Middle-earth in order to exercise her talents: "for being brilliant in mind and swift in action she had early absorbed all of what she was capable of the teaching which the Valar thought fit to give the Eldar". Manwë was probably aware of her desire and he had not forbidden her to depart, nor given permission yet. Nonetheless, Galadriel did not remain inactive and thought in the ships of the Teleri, so she dwelt in Alqualondë with her mother's kin. There she met Celeborn (here a Telerin prince and her cousin), and both planned to build a boat and seek the permission of the Valar to depart to Middle-earth. 

But then Melkor and Ungoliant destroyed the [[Two Trees]], and Fëanor began his rebellion, in which Galadriel had no part. "Indeed, she and Celeborn fought heroically in defence of Alqualondë against the assault of the Noldor, and Celeborn's ship was saved from them". Now Galadriel sailed in despair without asking Manwë, and indeed she would have been told to stay in Valinor in that hour, despite her desire being legitimate; and thus the ban against departure fell upon her and she was forbidden to return. She and Celeborn reached Middle-earth before Fëanor, finding Círdan's haven and being received with joy. They did not join the war against Morgoth, which they considered hopeless without the help of the Valar, and instead they recommended going eastwards and befriending the [[Dark Elves]] and Men living there. But the Elves of Beleriand did not heed these counsels, so both of them crossed the Ered Lindon before the end of the First Age. They were granted permission to return by the Valar, but they rejected it.

Christopher Tolkien explains that this change probably had its roots in the philosophical implications of Galadriel's power in Middle-earth. He is certain that his father had the intention of changing all the narrative of "The Silmarillion" related to the backstory of Galadriel, despite what was already written: after all, she was not part of the story of the Noldor in the first place and the book had not been published. The only notable problem is in the backstory of Celeborn, which contradicts what was already published in J.R.R. Tolkien's life.<ref name="History" />{{rp|231–3}}

===Unsolved contradictions===
As can be seen, the development of Galadriel throughout Tolkien's texts is mainly structured around the nature of her exile and ban from Aman. In this subsection we present other aspects of her that are better explained separately for order's sake. In the mentioned texts there are some loose contradictions that can be easily explained as mere mistakes. A noticeable case is Galadriel using [[Nenya]] during the Second Age in "[[Concerning Galadriel and Celeborn]]", which contradicts everything we know about the [[Rings of Power]] in ''The Lord of the Rings''. On the contrary, the contradictions presented in this subsection result from the several revisions and we cannot know how Tolkien would have solved them.

;:Galadriel in Nargothrond
In the ''[[Grey Annals]]'' it is written that Galadriel went from Doriath to Nargothrond "and dwelt there for a while" after Finrod had completed its building.<ref name="Nargothrond" /> But while expanding the ''[[The Later Quenta Silmarillion|Quenta Silmarillion]]'', Tolkien wrote: "Yet Galadriel his sister went never to Nargothrond, for she remained long in Doriath", and revised it with "Yet Galaðriel his sister dwelt never in Nargothrond".<ref>{{WJ|10}}, p. 178</ref> It is unclear which version was written as definitive, but Christopher Tolkien chose the former one for [[Of the Noldor in Beleriand|Chapter 15]] of his edition of ''The Silmarillion''.

;:Passing over the mountains
Christopher Tolkien explains that in the first conception, Galadriel went to the east from Beleriand alone and found Celeborn (probably of [[Nandor]]in origin) in Lórien. Hence in the chapter "[[The Mirror of Galadriel]]" she said Celeborn dwelt in the West before the Dawn, and that she crossed the mountains from Beleriand (apparently alone). This contradicts the information in [[Appendix B]] of ''The Lord of the Rings'' and in ''[[The Road Goes Ever On (book)|The Road Goes Ever On]]'', in which Celeborn is a Sinda who accompanied Galadriel from Lindon.<ref name="History" />{{rp|228}}

The time when she passed over the mountains is also contradictory, as Galadriel said that it was "''ere the fall of Nargothrond and Gondolin''", yet in Appendix B it is stated that at the beginning of the Second Age she was still dwelling in Lindon, before passing over the mountains. This contradiction in the same work must have been due to a mistake during revision.<ref group="note">It is possible, however, that Galadriel first left Beleriand to avoid the cataclysmic war, later came to Lindon to join the surviving exiles, and crossed the Ered Luin again looking for a settlement.</ref>

;:Marriage of Galadriel and Celeborn
In Appendix B, while describing the beginning of the Second Age, it is said that Celeborn dwelt in [[Harlindon|south Lindon]] with his wife Galadriel, so it appears that they were married at this point.<ref name="Second" /> In a manuscript from c. [[1959]], Tolkien said that Galadriel and Celeborn probably married "soon after the overthrow of Morgoth", before they crossed the Mountains.<ref name="Scales" /> Another manuscript from the same period states the same, but in its following notes Tolkien wrote that Galadriel did not marry Celeborn until they were settled (in Lake Nenuial, as understood by the context).<ref>{{NM|P1x}}, p. 73</ref> In a manuscript from [[1965]], while Tolkien pondered about Amroth being their child, he wrote that Galadriel and Celeborn were betrothed, but did not marry until the confusion of the War of Wrath and the beginning of the Second Age had ended (till S.A. 24).<ref name="Ages" />

;:Birth-year of Celebrían
The year and the place of Celebrían's birth was never definite. Tolkien considered as early as year 9 of the Second Age, and as late as 350 (850 was also considered, but as a mere conjecture). For details and references see ''[[Celebrían#Other versions of the legendarium]]''.

;:Mother of Amroth
In "Concerning Galadriel and Celeborn", both Celebrían and [[Amroth]] are children of Galadriel and Celeborn,<ref name="Concerning" /> but in later texts dating from [[1969]], Tolkien made Amroth the son of [[Amdír]].<ref>{{UT|Amroth}}, p. 244</ref> For more details see ''[[Amroth#Other versions of the legendarium]]''.

;:Founder of Eregion
In Appendix B, it is said that at the beginning of the Second Age, the Noldor went to [[Eregion]] out of their interest for the [[mithril]] in [[Moria]]. Besides, Celebrimbor is called "Lord of Eregion", with no mention of his relation with Galadriel.<ref name="Second" /> In "Concerning Galadriel and Celeborn", Galadriel and Celeborn are described as the founders of Eregion, a place chosen by Galadriel out of her desire to gather the Elven and the Dwarvish races against the increasing evil in Middle-earth. Celebrimbor is the chief builder of the realm, but is not mentioned as its lord, although he later seizes the power there.<ref name="Concerning" />{{rp|235–7}} Celebrimbor as the founder appears only in a linguistic work, in which Tolkien simply mentions "the settlement at Eregion under Celebrimbor".<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 53</ref> It is unclear if these texts are necessarily contradictory, but it is clear that trying to explain the rule in Eregion remains problematic.

===The published ''Silmarillion''===
Christopher Tolkien was aware of his father's [[#Unstained exile|latest conception]], in which Galadriel left Aman free of any guilt. However, as this was a mere projected idea, he had to make use of the completed narratives for his edition of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', in which she is a rebel leader.<ref name="History" />{{rp|232–3}} It is notable that in this work there is no explanation of Galadriel's reasons for remaining in Middle-earth after the War of Wrath, save that Celeborn was unwilling to leave,<ref name="Earendil" /> nor is there any mention of a ban against her return or her concerns about the remaining evil. This way, Christopher did not choose any particular position and let the reader guess, but also stripped this character of all development in relation to ''The Lord of the Rings''.

[[Douglas C. Kane]] noted that Christopher Tolkien, for his edition, removed some statements on Galadriel from his father's work: [[Of Eldamar and the Princes of the Eldalië|Chapter 5]]'s original text said that Galadriel was "the most valiant" lady of the [[house of Finwë]]; and [[Of the Flight of the Noldor|Chapter 9]]'s mentioned her as "Galadriel the valiant and fair". According to Kane, Galadriel is not the only female character inexplicably diminished by Christopher's editorial choices.<ref>[[Douglas C. Kane]], ''[[Arda Reconstructed: The Creation of the Published Silmarillion]]'' ([[2009]]), pp. 74, 114, 252</ref>

Earlier plans considered were to have either Frodo or Gandalf narrate the Prologue, but this was dropped: Frodo was not alive until thousands of years after these events happened, and although Gandalf was alive, he was not present in Middle-earth at the time; the Wizards came some one thousand years after the Prologue ends. Thus Galadriel narrates the Prologue, because she had first-hand accounts of this history and actively participated in its events.

'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''
:Galadriel frequently consults [[ósanwë|telepathically]] with Elrond; in the books there is no clear indication of how Galadriel knew about the coming of the Fellowship. In the film, unlike the book, Galadriel and [[Elrond]] send an army of [[Elves]] - led by [[Haldir]] - to [[Battle of the Hornburg|Helm's Deep]] to aid the [[Rohirrim]]. In the DVD commentary, [[Peter Jackson]] and his fellow writers explain that they worried audiences would wonder why the Elves do not seem to be helping in the war, while at the same time, they felt that actually inserting an entire separate battle scene at Lothlórien would take up too much screen time and resources.

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:A spiritual apparition of Lady Galadriel appears to provide Frodo strength following his passage through Shelob's Lair soon after he uses the Phial that she gave him. She is later seen leaving Middle-earth along with other Ring-bearers, but in film version her husband Celeborn departs with her at the same time.

'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:'''
:Cate Blanchett reprised her role as Galadriel, although the character is absent from the novel.<ref name="PJCasting">{{webcite|author=[[Peter Jackson]]|articleurl=http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150168211921558|articlename=Production begins in New Zealand on The Hobbit|dated=20-March-2011|website=[http://www.facebook.com/ Facebook]|accessed=23-Dec-2011}}</ref> She appears as part of the [[White Council]] alongside [[Saruman]], [[Gandalf]] and [[Elrond]]. Later, right before [[Thorin and Company|Thorin and his Company]] enter in [[Mirkwood]], she telepathically urges Gandalf to further seek the true identity of the [[Sauron#Sauron's Return|Necromancer]]. Finally, during the [[attack on Dol Guldur]], Galadriel plays a larger role. She first rescues Gandalf from captivity, and is ultimately the one to drive Sauron from the fortress using her [[Phial of Galadriel|phial]], although weakened by the amount of power she used.

===Radio series===
'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of Galadriel is provided by [[Marian Diamond]]. In addition to the Lothlórien episodes, the voice of Galadriel is heard in Shelob's Lair as a reminder to use the phial, and she appears with Elrond in the final episode in the Shire, as they journey towards the Grey Havens.

'''2001-2003: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''
:The voice of Galadriel is provided by Soňa Norisová. Norisová also provides most of the singing in the series (including the opening and closing titles theme and series closing song), alluding to Galadriel being a secondary storyteller (with Bilbo Baggins serving as the series' primary storyteller).

===Games===
'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:Galadriel, voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]], is the narrator of the Prologue and the Epilogue, and appears in Lothlórien.

'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II]]'':'''
:Galadriel is the strongest of "Hero" units available to the Free Peoples. If a player's army manages to spot [[Gollum]] on the battlefield, take The One Ring from him and deliver it to their forces, the option to "summon" Galadriel unlocks for a large amount of resources. Thus, Lady Galadriel is represented as succumbing to corruption of The Ring, similar to the respective scene in the ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' movie.

'''2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Introduced in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Mines of Moria]]'', Galadriel plays a prominent role during the Epic storyline with guidance and support. During the final days of the [[War of the Ring]], Galadriel assembles the Council of Elven Lords, where it is decided to bring their armies against [[Dol Guldur]]. After she brings down the walls of Dol Guldur, Galadriel accompanies Arwen on her journey south to her wedding, and they visit the site of [[Celebrian]]'s captivity in the [[Misty Mountains]] together. Afterwards, she and Celeborn join the procession of [[Elrond]]'s house and travel to [[Minas Tirith]] to attend the wedding of Arwen and Aragorn.

'''2014: [[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]:'''
:Galadriel is featured in the game, although she is a non-playable character. She is voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]] and she narrates the prologue in a showing of the game.

'''2017: [[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]]:'''
:Galadriel is featured in the game, although she is a non-playable character, with [[Jennifer Hale]] reprising her role from the game.
