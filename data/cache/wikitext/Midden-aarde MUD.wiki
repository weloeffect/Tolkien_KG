'''Midden-aarde MUD''' (Dutch: ''Middle-earth MUD'') is a Dutch MUD made by "Irmo" and several other programmers. In 2009 the unofficial test version was launched, with gameplay in [[Middle-earth]] as a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]], [[Men]], [[Dwarves|Dwarf]], [[Elves|Elf]] or [[Rangers of the North|Dúnedain-Ranger]]. Later that year the project was canceled for a time. But since [[2010]] the game is play-able again. The MUD originally only included [[the Shire]], but now also includes gameplay in [[Bree-land]], [[Rivendell]] and [[Ost-in-Edhil]].
