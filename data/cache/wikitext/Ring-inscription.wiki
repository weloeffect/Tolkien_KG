The '''Ring-inscription'''<ref>{{App|E1iv}}</ref> was a [[Black Speech]]<ref name=Council>{{FR|Council}}, pp. 252-3</ref> inscription in [[Tengwar]]<ref>{{App|Writing}}, p. 1117</ref><ref>{{App|Letters}}, Footnote 2, p. 1117</ref> upon the [[One Ring]], symbolising the Ring's power to control the other [[Rings of Power]], and perhaps being an actual part of its power.

== Description == 
The One Ring appeared perfectly plain and featureless, but when heated, the inscription appeared in fiery letters on the Ring.<ref name=Shadow>{{FR|Shadow}}, p. 50</ref> 

<center>[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - One Ring inscription.png|320px]]</center>

When [[Isildur]] cut the ring from Sauron's hand, it was burning hot, and so Isildur was able to transcribe the inscription before it faded. He described it to be written in an [[Tengwar#The General Use|elven-script]] of [[Eregion]] in a language that was not known to him.<ref name=Council/>

[[Gandalf]] first learned of the inscription when he read the [[Scroll of Isildur|account]] that Isildur had written before marching north to his [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields|death]] and the loss of the Ring.<ref name=Council/> When Gandalf subsequently heated the ring that [[Bilbo Baggins]] had found and passed on to [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], the inscription appeared, leaving him in no doubt that it was the One Ring.<ref name=Shadow/>

Long before, at the creation of the One Ring, the smiths of [[Eregion]] who had forged the other [[Rings of Power]] heard in their minds the voice of [[Sauron]], reciting the words. They then realized his plans, removing the rings from their fingers.<ref>{{S|Rings}}</ref>

== Translation ==
[[File:Christopher Lee - Ring Poem Black Speech.mp3|thumb|[[Christopher Lee]] reads the [[Black Speech]] of the Ring-inscription]]
The inscription read:<ref name=Council/>

<blockquote>''[[Ash]] [[nazg]] [[durbatulûk]], ash nazg [[gimbatul]], ash nazg [[thrakatulûk]], [[agh]] [[burzum]]-[[ishi]] [[krimpatul]]''</blockquote>

These words were disturbing to any [[Elves]] who heard them, as any words of that "Black Speech". When Gandalf recited them at the [[Council of Elrond]], the sky darkened and the Elves trembled and covered their ears. This was the first time words of that language had been spoken in Rivendell.<ref name=Council/>

Roughly translated, these words mean:<ref name=Shadow/><ref group=note>According to page 83 of {{HM|RC}} the second line was accidentally omitted in Chapter 2 in early pritings of the 1994 HarperCollins edition and in other British and American editions that were based on that resetting.</ref>

<blockquote>''One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them''<ref name=Shadow/></blockquote>

== Ring-verse ==
At some point following the gifting of the rings, a verse was written and kept as part of the Elven-lore:<ref name=Shadow/>

<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky,
Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,
Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die,
One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.
   One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them,
   One Ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them
In the Land of Mordor where the Shadows lie.''</poem>

== Inspiration ==
[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] has said that he first thought of the Ring-verse while taking a bath.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. liv</ref>

==Other versions of the Legendarium==
[[Christopher Tolkien]] provides early versions of the Ring-verse, showing different dispositions of the Rings of Power:<ref name=Note14>{{RS|2XVN}}, Note 14, p. 269</ref>

<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Nine for the Elven-kings under moon and star,
Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,
Three for Mortal Men that wander far,
One for the Dark Lord on his dark throne
In the Land of Mor-dor where the shadows are.
...
</poem>

and
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Twelve for Mortal Men doomed to die,
Nine for the Dwarf-lords in their halls of stone,
Three for the Elven-kings of earth, sea, and sky
...
</poem>

== Portrayal in adaptations ==
'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:The Ring-inscription poses a plot gap in the movie. Gandalf makes Frodo throw the Ring in the fireplace, and later they both notice it is cold. The Ring-inscription does not appear nor is mentioned, although Gandalf recites the verse; all these remain without giving any explanation why the Ring was thrown in the fireplace in the first place, since the non-existent inscription was not the point.

'''1981: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:The Black Speech words form the "background" sound in various scenes about the Ring, and Gandalf speaks them at the Council of Elrond.

'''2001-2003: [[Pán prsteňov (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)|''Pán prsteňov'' (2001-2003 Slovak radio series)]]:'''
:The Ring-verse is heard in the main opening and closing theme of the radio series, sung by Soňa Norisová (who also portrays Galadriel). The opening titles version of the them also includes the opening narration of the series, by Bilbo Baggins (Marián Labuda) as the chronicler of the War of the Ring. The theme was composed by Peter Mankovecký and adapted by the [[wikipedia:Slovak Radio Symphonic Orchestra|Slovak Radio Symphonic Orchestra]] and its choir.

'''2001-03: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''
:In the book, Gandalf mentions the Black Speech phrase in the [[Council of Elrond]] in order to prove his concerns about the Ring, the atmosphere darkens and the Elves seem to suffer to hear the words. In [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|the first film]] he utters the words while the participants begin to argue and shout in order to "darken" the atmosphere and make them stop. It is not mentioned anywhere in the context that these lines were the inscription of the Ring and he appeared like as he was conjuring a "spell". That event was a bit controversial to the fans of the books, since it was like somehow Gandalf made use of the Shadow in order to restore order, performing thus "dark [[magic]]"{{fact}}.

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:The Ring-inscription is found only on the outer side of the ring. Gandalf speaks the words several times, both in Bag End and Rivendell. The Black Speech version can also be found on the cover art and disc, however, it is written in poor quality [[Angerthas Erebor]]. A writer who was unfamiliar with the [[Daniel Steven Smith#Keymapping|keyboard values]] of most [[fonts|Elvish fonts]] simply typed "a-s-h n-a-z-g (et cetera)", so the runes read "l-lh-ng ô-l-e-s (et cetera)" in proper Angerthas Erebor.

'''2014: ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]'':'''
:The first two lines of the Ring-verse are spoken in Black Speech by the [[Sauron|Necromancer]] in Dol Guldur, then Galadriel speaks the third line in Westron as the nine [[Nazgûl]] appear and surround her.

'''2014: ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor]]'':'''
:The words of the Ring-inscription in the Black Speech are chanted in the opening cinematic and are quoted several times throughout the game, especially when distracting enemies where the words "Ash Nazg" can be heard being whispered by the Wraith.

'''2017: ''[[Lord of the Rings Online#Mordor Expansion|The Lord of the Rings Online: Mordor]]'':'''
:The words of the Ring-verse in the Black Speech, along with Sauron's name are used as lyrics in the track "Chant for Sauron", composed by [[Chance Thomas]]. The track itself has been in the game ever since the ''[[Lord of the Rings Online#Mines of Moria Expansion|Mines of Moria]]'' expansion, used as background music during the boss fight against Caerlûg in Nala-dûm, but was first released in an official soundtrack with the ''Mordor'' expansion.

'''2022: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'':'''
:The Ring-verse is sung during the end credits of ''[[Alloyed]]''. According to [[Bear McCreary]], there is a build-up in themes that lead to the song throughout the first season.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Bear McCreary]]|articleurl=https://bearmccreary.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-appendices-part-2/|articlename=The Lord of the Rings: Appendices Part 2|dated=22 September 2022|website=[https://bearmccreary.com/ Bear McCreary]|accessed=5 February 2023}}</ref>
