<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
:Twenty years have flowed away down the long river
:And never in my life will return for me from the sea
:Ah years in which looking far away I saw ages long past
:When still trees bloomed free in a wide country
:And thus now all begins to wither
:With the breath of cold-hearted wizards
:To know things they break them
:And their stern lordship they establish
:Through fear of death.<ref name=unearthed>{{webcite|author=Noble Smith|articleurl=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/noble-smith/jrr-tolkien-reveals-the-t_b_5373529.html|articlename=J.R.R.
