The '''Elves of Lindon''' were those [[Elves]] who dwelt in [[Lindon]] in the west of [[Middle-earth]], between the [[Blue Mountains]] and the [[Belegaer|Great Sea]]. 

==History==
===Rule of Gil-galad===
In {{SA|1}},<ref name=SA/> the [[Elves]] built the [[Grey Havens]] in the newly-formed [[Gulf of Lune]] where the [[Eldar]] sailed the [[Straight Road]], but most of them were unwilling at first to forsake the lands they fought in and preferred to linger there.<ref name=rings/> This was the foundation of [[Lindon]] and its people.<ref name=SA/> Among those that remained were [[Círdan the Shipwright]], [[Celeborn|Celeborn of Doriath]], [[Galadriel]], [[Elrond]], and [[Celebrimbor]].<ref name="Earendil">{{S|Earendil}}</ref> [[Gil-galad]] was the last heir of the [[King of the Noldor|kings of the Noldor]] in exile, and acknowledged as [[High King of the Noldor|High King of the Elves of the West]] and so, he was their king.<ref name=SA/><ref name=rings/> 

In the beginning of the [[Second Age]], most of the [[Noldor]] that remained in [[Middle-earth]] dwelt in [[Lindon]] but,<ref name=SA/> many [[Teleri]], survivors of [[Doriath]] and [[Ossiriand]], left [[Lindon]] before {{SA|1000}} to establish realms among the [[Silvan Elves]].<ref name=princes/> [[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]] brought many [[Noldor]], [[Sindar]], and [[Green-elves]]<ref name=concerning/> out of Lindon into [[Eriador]] to dwell there for some time.<ref name=concerning>{{UT|Concerning}}</ref> Many of the [[Noldor]] in Lindon lead by [[Celebrimbor]] established the realm of [[Eregion]] in {{SA|750}} near the [[West-gate]] of [[Moria|Khazad-Dûm]] due to the recent discovery of [[mithril]] in [[Moria|Khazad-Dûm]].<ref name=SA/> 

A fair being calling himself [[Annatar]], an emissary of the [[Valar]], came seeking entrance. Gil-galad and Master [[Elrond]] sensed that he was not what he seemed, and denied him. Messengers were sent from [[Lindon]] with warnings; but they were unheeded, and Annatar was received gladly, mostly in [[Eregion]]. However, [[Gil-galad]] and [[Elrond]] were proven correct, as Annatar was indeed [[Sauron]] and later, [[War of the Elves and Sauron|there was war in Eriador]].<ref name=rings>{{S|Rings}}</ref> [[Elrond]] led the Elves of Lindon in [[Sack of Eregion|battle to defend Eregion]]. With them, and other [[Elves of Eregion|Elves]] who fled the destruction of [[Eregion]], he established [[Imladris]] in {{SA|1697}}.<ref name=SA/> In the [[Dark Years]], [[Sauron]] had conquered most of the [[Westlands]], but in {{SA|1700}} [[Tar-Minastir]] sent a fleet to [[Lindon]], aiding the Elves of Lindon to drive [[Sauron]] out of [[Eriador]].<ref name=SA/><ref name=rings/> After those events, the Elves of Lindon were diminished and did not extend their realm east of the [[Blue Mountains]] anymore.<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, Note 75</ref>

When [[Ar-Pharazôn]] captured Sauron and took him to [[Númenor]], the [[Westlands]] found peace, and Gil-galad was free to extend his power and influence so that the Elves of Lindon controlled most of the [[Westlands]], even to the borders of [[Greenwood the Great]], until the [[Downfall of Númenor]], when Sauron returned to Middle-earth.<ref name=rings/>

At the end of the Age, Gil-galad joined the [[Last Alliance]] and led the Elves of Lindon to the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. Some of the [[Silvan Elves]] felt hostility towards the [[Noldor]] of Lindon, and did not cooperate, suffering heavy losses.<ref name=princes/>

===Decline===

After the fall of Gil-galad (during the time of the [[Kings of Arnor]]), there was still a remnant of his people, the [[Noldor]], who dwelt at the [[Grey Havens]] of further inland in Lindon, who, aside from [[Rivendell]], were most of the remaining Noldor of [[Middle-earth]].<ref name=rings/><ref name=eriador/> The Elves of Lindon would often wander into [[Eriador]] but they mostly dwelt by the sea building the elven-ships in which many [[Eldar]] would depart to [[Valinor]].<ref name=rings/> [[Cirdan]] remained the Lord of the Havens and ruled the Elves of Lindon.<ref name=rings/><ref name=eriador/> 

During the [[Third Age]], the Elves of Lindon under [[Cirdan]] supported [[Arnor]] in the [[Angmar War]]. They assisted [[Arveleg I]] and [[Cardolan]] drive off the [[Hill-men]] from the [[Weather Hills]]. Later, with [[Círdan]]'s help, [[Arveleg I|Arveleg]]'s young son, [[Araphor]], drove [[Angmar]]'s armies from [[Fornost]] and the [[North Downs]]. Combining forces with [[Rivendell]], and the [[Galadhrim]] who joined them from beyond the [[Misty Mountains]], they subdued Angmar for some time.<ref name=eriador/> They also assisted King [[Araval]] in a coalition with [[Rivendell]], in another battle against Angmar in {{TA|1851}}.<ref name=Elendil>{{PM|Elendil}}, pp. 195, 209-210</ref> In {{TA|1975}}, Elves from Lindon brought a ship to [[Forochel]] to rescue [[Arvedui Last-king]]. The crew endured a perilous journey, but Arvedui rashly attempted to return that winter, and all aboard perished. The [[Third Age 1976|next year]], the Elves of Lindon joined the [[Host of the West (Arnor)|Host of the West]], and Cirdan led them to victory in the [[Battle of Fornost]].<ref name=eriador>{{App|Eriador}}</ref><ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

In the later [[Third Age]] some Elves from Lindon could be seen [[Wandering Companies|traversing]] [[the Shire]], especially during Spring and Autumn. It was some of the few occasions that [[Hobbits]] could see Elves.<ref>{{FR|Three}}</ref> During the [[War of the Ring]], [[Galdor of the Havens|Galdor]] was sent to [[Rivendell]] on an errand for [[Círdan]] and he represented the Elves of Lindon at the [[Council of Elrond]].<ref>{{FR|Council}}</ref>

The [[Last Ship]], carrying [[Círdan]] and [[Celeborn]], sailed at some unknown date after {{FoA|171}}.<ref>{{FR|Prologue}}</ref><ref name=AppTale>{{App|Tale}}</ref>

==Population==
The original Elves of Lindon in the [[Elder Days]], were [[Laiquendi]], the [[Green-elves]] of [[Ossiriand]]. Even after the Elder Days passed, after they were joined by other [[Elves of Beleriand]], the Laiquendi remained; some of them removed to [[Eriador]]<ref name=concerning/> and others went to [[Rhovanion]] to live among the [[Silvan Elves]].<ref name=rings/> 

[[Gil-galad]]'s people were mainly [[Noldor]]<ref>{{PM|XNotes}}, Note 65</ref> (especially from [[Gondolin]], but also from the [[House of Finarfin|Houses of Finarfin]] and [[House of Fëanor|Fëanor]]); early in the [[Second Age]], most of the [[Noldor]] that remained in [[Middle-earth]] lived in Lindon.<ref name=SA/>  During this time, the few [[Exiles]] that remained lived in Lindon.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}</ref> Even in the [[Third Age]], the Elves of Lindon consisted most of the [[Noldor]] that still lingered in [[Middle-earth]].<ref name=eriador/>

The Elves of [[Harlindon]], the people of Lindon south of the [[Gulf of Lhûn]], were mostly [[Sindar]], ruled by [[Celeborn]] for some time.<ref name=SA>{{App|SA}}</ref><ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}, Note 2</ref> Before the building of the [[Barad-dûr]], many [[Sindar]], survivors of [[Doriath]] uneasy living among the [[Noldor]] of [[Gil-galad]], went to east to establish realms among the [[Silvan Elves]].<ref name=SA/><ref name=rings/><ref name=princes>{{UT|6b}}</ref> Some of these [[Sindar]] also removed to the shores of [[Lake Nenuial]].<ref name=concerning/>
