'''Argonui''' was the thirteenth [[Chieftain of the Dúnedain]].<ref name=Argonui/>

== History ==
Argonui succeeded his father, [[Arathorn I]], in {{TA|2848}}.<ref name=Arathorn/>

During his reign, [[Bilbo Baggins]] was born in [[The Shire]] in {{TA|2890|n}},<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2890, p. 1088</ref> as well as [[Gilraen]], [[Aragorn]]'s mother, in {{TA|2907|n}}.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2907, p. 1088</ref>

Towards the end of his rule, in {{TA|2911|n}}, the [[Fell Winter (Third Age)|Fell Winter]] began, with the river [[Brandywine]] freezing over. This was a catalyst for the [[White Wolves]] invading [[Eriador]] from the North.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2911, p. 1089</ref>

In the last year of his reign, great floods devastated [[Enedwaith]] and [[Minhiriath]], leaving the town of [[Tharbad]] ruined and deserted.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2912, p. 1089</ref>

Argonui died in {{TA|2912|n}},<ref name=Argonui/> after having ruled for 64 years, and was followed by his son [[Arador]].<ref name=Arador>{{App|North}}, ''Chieftains'', Arador, p. 1038</ref>

== Etymology ==
The name ''Argonui'' is in [[Sindarin]], possibly meaning "Royal Valour" according to ''[[Tolkiendil (Tolkien society)|Tolkiendil]]''.<ref>{{webcite|author=Assocation  Tolkiendil|articleurl=http://www.tolkiendil.com/langues/english/i-lam_arth/compound_sindarin_names|articlename=Compound Sindarin Names in Middle-earth|website=Tolkiendil|accessed=05 February 2022}}</ref>

The first element of the name is ''[[ara|ar(a)]]''- ("noble, royal, high"); however, the second element is unclear, though it might consist of the noun ''[[caun]]'' ("prince, chief, head") + an adjectival suffix ''[[-ui]]''.<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Paul Strack]]|articleurl=http://eldamo.org/content/words/word-412080965.html|articlename=S. ''Argonui'' m.|website=Eldamo|accessed=4 September 2022}}</ref><ref>{{HM|GS}}, pp. 246, 342</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
Argonui's year of birth is only mentioned in earlier manuscript versions of what would later become Appendix A. In general, J.R.R. Tolkien did not include the year of birth of kings and rulers in Appendix A or Appendix B.

In the later manuscript C Argonui's years of birth and death were {{TA|2757}} and {{TA|2912|n}}, respectively.<ref name=ManuscriptC>{{PM|Elendil}}, ''End of the North Kingdom'', 38. 13. Argonui, p. 196</ref> In the same manuscript it is also mentioned that [[Dírhael]], the maternal grandfather of [[Aragorn]], was descended from Arathorn I "by a younger branch".<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, ''End of the North Kingdom'', 40. 15. Arathorn II, p. 196</ref>

In the earlier manuscript B, the years of Argonui's birth and death were {{TA|2746}} and {{TA|2901|n}}, respectively.<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, ''Commentary'', Argonui, pp. 210-11</ref>
