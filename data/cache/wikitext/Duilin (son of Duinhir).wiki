'''Duilin''' was one of the two sons of [[Duinhir]], the lord of [[Blackroot Vale]].

==History==
With his brother [[Derufin]], Duilin followed his father to [[Minas Tirith]] in the [[War of the Ring]],<ref>{{RK|MT}}</ref> and there they fought in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. The Men of the distant valley of [[Morthond]] had great skill as bowmen, and so Duilin and Derufin led their archers against the [[mûmakil]], attempting to shoot out the beasts' eyes. Brave as they were, both the brothers were lost in that battle, trampled by their gigantic foes.<ref>{{RK|Battle}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The meaning of ''Duilin'' is unclear. Both in [[Gnomish]] and in the later [[Noldorin]] the name meant "swallow",<ref>{{LT2|Appendix}}, entry "Duilin"</ref><ref>{{PE|13}}, pp. 120, 142</ref> but in [[Sindarin]] it could be "Singer by the River" or "Spring-Singer", containing the same element ''[[duin]]'' "river" as in the name of his father.<ref>[[David Salo]], ''[[A Gateway to Sindarin]]'', p. 347</ref>
