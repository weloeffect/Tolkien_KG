== First stanza ==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
:From the many-willowed margin of the immemorial Thames
::Standing in a vale outcarven in a world-forgotten day
:There is dimly seen uprising through the greenly veiléd stems
::Many-mansioned tower-crownéd in its dreamy robe of grey
:That strange city by the river agéd in the lives of men
::Proudly wrapt in mystic memory overpassing human ken.<ref name=collectedpoems/></poem>

== Background ==
In the second half<ref name=chronology1911>{{CG|C}}, p. 29 (entry "Second half of October 1911")</ref> of October during the Michaelmas Term in 1911,<ref name=chronologyterm>{{CG|C}}, p. 28 (entry "Michaelmas Term 1911")</ref> Tolkien wrote a short untitled ode of two stanzas during his first undergraduate term at the [[University of Oxford]]. Tolkien later entitled it '''''From [[Wikipedia:Iffley|Iffley]]'''''. When Tolkien sent it to the ''[[Stapeldon Magazine]]'' to be published, the second stanza was lost by the editor. As such, in [[December]] of [[1913]],<ref name=chronology1913>{{CG|C}}, p. 47 (entry "December 1913")</ref> the first stanza was published without a title<ref name=chronology1913/> as no. twenty on page 11 in the magazine's fourth volume. Tolkien signed the poem with just his first initial. In a later revision on an unknown date, Tolkien made minor changes to the poem, including changing the title to ''Valedictory''.<ref name=reader/>

In the spring of [[1915]],<ref name=collectedpoems/> Tolkien sent a copy of the poem to [[Christopher Wiseman]], who wrote back to him in [[April]].<ref name=chronology1915>{{CG|C}}, p. 64 (entry "Trinity Term 1915")</ref>

In [[September]] of [[2024]], the poem was re-published as entry 10 in ''[[The Collected Poems of J.R.R. Tolkien]]''.<ref name=collectedpoems/>
