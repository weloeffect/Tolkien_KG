He also served as an additional second unit director; he describes one of his works as "[i]t was the bit where the hobbits were being dragged from the burning tavern by the orcs"<sup>[http://www.pukeariki.com/en/stories/arts/titokowarufilm.htm]</sup>, which made it into the trailer for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]''. It is unclear as to what scene he is referring; no scene matching his description is in the trailer. He could be referring to a scene shot for the [[The Mirror of Galadriel (scene)|The Mirror of Galadriel]] scene in ''The Fellowship of the Ring''.

{{quote|There were three grades of rubber feet - there were the Cadillacs (for the stars), Fords for the smaller parts and the extras had Fiats. It depended on how long you had to wear them for. [...] By the time it was all over my feet were awash, and so very, very sore.|Ian Mune, [http://www.pukeariki.com/en/stories/arts/titokowarufilm.htm Puke Ariki interview]. He wore Fords.}}
