{{Quote|Arrow! Black arrow! I have saved you to the last. You have never failed me and always I have recovered you. I had you from my father and he from of old.

'''Bard''', titled "'''the Bowman'''", was a descendant of [[Girion]], the [[Lord of Dale]], who slew the dragon [[Smaug]] and refounded [[Dale]]. He ruled his [[Kingdom of Dale|new kingdom]] as '''Bard I'''.

==History== 
Bard, the heir of [[Girion]], the last [[Lord of Dale]] whose wife and children had fled from the ruin of Dale down the [[River Running]] was known for his worth and courage and lived in Lake-town when Smaug attacked the town<ref name="Fire"></ref> in {{TA|2941}}.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2941, p. 1089</ref> When Bard recognized that the dragon was coming, he ran to the [[Master of Lake-town]] and shouted to cut the bridges and to get arms. Bard cheered on the archers and held out with a great yew bow in the burning town as the captain of a company of archers. He was an able archer and had inherited a [[black arrow]] from his ancestors, which had never failed him and which he had always recovered.<ref name="Fire"/>
[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Black Arrow.jpg|thumb|left|''The Black Arrow'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
When Bard had shot all his arrows, except the black arrow, which he had saved for his last shot, the old [[Thrushes|thrush]] (who had overheard [[Bilbo Baggins]]' description of [[Smaug]])<ref>{{H|Inside}}</ref> revealed an unarmoured spot on the Dragon's armpit to him and Bard killed the dragon by shooting him in the unarmoured spot with the black arrow. Because of his miraculous shot, he was given the epithet "the Bowman" and "the Dragon-shooter".<ref name="Fire"/>
[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Arkenstone.jpg|thumb|''The Arkenstone'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
After the disaster, he led the [[Lake-men]] to the [[Lonely Mountain]] demanding a part of the treasure from the [[Dwarves]].<ref name="Gather">{{H|Gathering}}</ref> The [[Elves of Mirkwood|Wood-elves]] and [[Thranduil]] came to demand their own shares. Seeing [[Thorin]]'s reluctance to help, Bilbo Baggins delivered the [[Arkenstone]] to them to bargain with.<ref>{{H|Thief}}</ref> Afterwards, when the [[Orcs]] and [[Wargs]] came, Bard led his Men in the [[Battle of Five Armies]].<ref>{{H|Burst}}</ref>

The victors divided the treasure and Bard took Bilbo's fourteenth share of the gold and silver in return for the Arkenstone, whereupon he shared his reward with the [[Master of Lake-town]] to rebuild the town, and gave Thranduil the emeralds of Girion.<ref name="Gather"/> However, the Master stole the money and ran off into the wild where he died of hunger.<ref>{{H|Stage}}</ref> 

Three years later, in {{TA|2944}} after the rebuilding of the city, Bard became the first [[King of Dale|King]] of [[Kingdom of Dale|restored Dale]].<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2944, p. 1089</ref> He was succeeded by his son, [[Bain]] in {{TA|2977}}.<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2977, p. 1090</ref>

== Etymology ==
It is not known, if Bard was a name in the [[language of Dale]] and the [[Long Lake]]. This language is only represented by a few names, especially the names of the [[Dwarves]], which came from that region. The names of those Dwarves are  [[Old Norse]] names.<ref>{{L|144}}</ref> In other Germanic names (such as [[Isembard Took|Isembard]]), ''bard'' refers to ''beard''. This could be either the facial hair, or more likely ''"Battle-Axe"'' (''beard'' is also a term for a part of an axe).

Jim Allan suggests that Bard is a Germanic element, which means "Battle-axe".<ref>{{HM|IE}}, Giving of Names, p. 226</ref>

Bjoern Fromen suggests that Bard could be a modernized (i.e. anglicised/westronized) form of Old Norse ''Barthi'' (recte ''bartha'') ("battle-axe").<ref>{{webcite|author=Bjoern Fromen|articleurl=https://tolkienlistsearch.herokuapp.com/message/5e9c3612b3e7d8c2909d5e97|articlename=Bain, Bard, Brand; Kloczko's Dictionnair|website=tolkienlistsearch|accessed=16 November 2024}}</ref>

Robert Ireland and [[Ruth S. Noel]], who perhaps overlooked the connection to Old Norse, provide as translations the [[Celtic]] words, ''bárd'' ("guardian")<ref>Robert Ireland, [http://www.quicksilver899.com/Tolkien/LOTR/LOTR_AC.html Lord of the Rings Dictionary, A - C]</ref> and ''bard'' ("poet").<ref>[[Ruth S. Noel]], ''[[The Languages of Tolkien's Middle-earth]]'', "The Languages of Rhovanion"</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In his original concept of ''[[The Hobbit]]'', [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] intended Bilbo Baggins to be the slayer of Smaug the Dragon, stabbing him in his sleep in his lair in the [[Lonely Mountain]].  Tolkien then changed his mind and in a major shift decided that Smaug would die at [[Lake-town|Esgaroth]].<ref>{{HH|PNC}}, pp. 496-497</ref>  This necessitated the creation of a hero, Bard, who was revealed to be the descendant of Girion.  Having created this dragon-slayer, Tolkien was going to let him die in the wreck of Lake-town.<ref>{{HH|Death}}, p. 549</ref>  However, realizing new possibilities for the story, especially having a rightful claimant to part of the dragon's hoard other than the Dwarves, Tolkien kept Bard alive.<ref>{{HH|Death}}, (i) ''Bard the Dragon-Slayer'', p. 555</ref>

The Dwarves agree to pay him to smuggle them into [[Lake-town]] and get the weapons and supplies they need for reaching the [[Lonely Mountain]]. He takes them in to his home until they plan to leave. When he learns of Thorin's true identity, he becomes worried about the Dwarves' quest, believing the [[Smaug|Dragon]] will destroy everything in its path if awakened. In addition to his son, [[Bain]], Bard also has two daughters: [[Sigrid]] and [[Tilda]]. He is also revealed to be a widower.

:Known by the [[Master of Lake-town]] (and his right hand man [[Alfrid]]) to be the descendant of [[Girion]], the last [[lord of Dale]], and fearing he may be trying to undermine their authority, Bard is under constant surveillance by various spies.

He becomes a hero among the town's survivors and leads them in taking refuge in the remains of [[Dale]]. When [[Thranduil]] arrives with an army of [[Elves]] to attack the mountain, Bard attempts to peacefully come to terms with Thorin. He asks him for a portion of the treasure which Thorin had promised to the people of Lake-town, but Thorin refuses to give them anything while Thranduil's army remains. After this, Bard reluctantly joins Thranduil in his attack. However, the arrival of an [[Orcs|Orc]] army leads all involved to refocus their attention and battle the Orcs instead.
