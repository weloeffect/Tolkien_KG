The '''Westmarch''' of [[the Shire]] was land that lay between the [[Far Downs]] and the [[Tower Hills]] in [[Eriador]], west of and originally outside of the Shire.  The only known town in this new district was [[Undertowers]].<ref name="Later">{{App|Later}}</ref>

==History==
In {{SR|1452}}, the Westmarch was given to the [[Shire-hobbits]] as a gift from [[Aragorn|King Elessar]].<ref name="Later"/>

At the request of Mayor [[Samwise Gamgee|Samwise]], [[Thain]] [[Peregrin Took|Peregrin I]] made [[Fastred of Greenholm]] the first [[Warden of Westmarch]] in {{SR|1462}}. Fastred and [[Elanor Gardner]] moved to [[Undertowers]]; many other hobbits migrated to the Westmarch.<ref name="Later"/>

The Warden kept the [[Red Book of Westmarch]] as an heirloom of the [[Fairbairn Family]].  It was long preserved at Undertowers and was the most important source for the history of the [[War of the Ring]].<ref>{{FR|Records}}</ref>
