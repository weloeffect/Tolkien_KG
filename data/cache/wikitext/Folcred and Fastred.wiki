'''Folcred''' and '''Fastred''' were the eldest children,<ref name=Fengel/> and the [[twins|twin]] sons of King [[Folcwine]] of [[Rohan]].<ref name=Folcwine/>

== History == 
In the days of [[Ruling Stewards|Steward]] [[Túrin II]] of [[Gondor]] the [[Haradrim]] had occupied [[South Gondor]] and there were many armed conflicts along the river [[Poros]].<ref name=TurinII>{{App|Stewards}}, entry for Steward Túrin II, p. 1054</ref> In {{TA|2885}} emissaries of [[Sauron]] stirred up the Haradrim who crossed the Poros invaded Ithilien<ref name=TA2885/> with a large army.<ref name=TurinII/> When King [[Folcwine]] of [[Rohan]] heard of the invasion he fulfilled the [[Oath of Eorl]]<ref name=TurinII/> and sent many men led by his sons Folcred and Fastred to help Túrin II.<ref name=Folcwine/>

Túrin II defeated the Haradrim invaders with the help of the troops from Rohan in a [[Battle of the Crossings of Poros|battle]] at the [[Crossings of Poros]],<ref name=TurinII/> but Folcred and Fastred fell side by side in battle in Ithilien.<ref name=Folcwine/> 

They were buried together high upon the shore of the river Poros according to the customs of their [[Rohirrim|people]] in a burial mound, which was called ''[[Haudh in Gwanûr]]''. The mound stood there for a long time and the enemies of Gondor were afraid to pass the mound.<ref name=TurinII/>
