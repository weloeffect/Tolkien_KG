'''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring – Trick-Taking Game''' is a cooperative card game for one to four players. Similar to classic trick-taking games like Bridge and Spades, players play cards matching a lead suit along with characters with unique abilities to get through one of eighteen unique scenarios. Features art by [[Elaine Ryan]] and [[Samuel R. Shimota]].

==From the publisher==
Follow the key story beats of the iconic fantasy tale by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], starting with [[Bilbo Baggins]]’ [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|Eleventy-First birthday party]] in [[Bag End]]. Players are taken through eighteen total chapters chronologically, focusing on big story moments and the beloved literary characters among them. Each chapter introduces new challenges, characters, and items; slowly revealing cards that build toward the forming of [[The Fellowship]]. Story cards are used at the beginning of each chapter, featuring actual text from the book, to set the mood as you begin your adventure.

Middle-earth awaits!
