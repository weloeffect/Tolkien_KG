The '''Éothéod''' were a race of [[Northmen]] who flourished near the [[Vales of Anduin]] and later in northern [[Mirkwood]] from around {{TA|1856}} to {{TA|2510|n}}. They were faithful allies to [[Gondor]], and eventually were the ancestors of the [[Rohirrim]].

==History==
After the [[Battle of the Plains]] ({{TA|1856}}), the lands of the Northmen of [[Rhovanion]] between Mirkwood and the [[River Running]] were occupied by the [[Wainriders]] and its people were enslaved. To escape this fate, many of the Northmen fled Rhovanion; some north to Dale, others south to Gondor. [[Marhwini]], son of [[Marhari]], led one such band of refugees north between the eastern bank of the [[Anduin]] and the western eaves of Mirkwood. Along the way they were joined by additional fugitives who had fled through the forest. They ended their journey in the Vales of Anduin between the [[Carrock]] and the [[Gladden Fields]], where they settled for the most part on the west side of the river. There they became known as the Éothéod.<ref name="Northmen">{{UT|Northmen}}</ref>

These migrations happened outside the knowledge of [[Gondor]], who learned about their existence many years later. That was until around {{TA|1899|n}}, when Marhwini warned [[Calimehtar (King of Gondor)|Calimehtar]] that the Wainriders were plotting to raid [[Calenardhon]] over the [[Undeeps]]. But the enslaved Northmen also prepared a revolt against the Wainriders. Calimehtar therefore provoked the Wainriders out of [[Ithilien]], and his horsemen, joined by a large [[Éored]] led by Marhwini, drove the Wainriders back. Meanwhile outlaws and roused slaves from Mirkwood burned many Wainriders settlements. Marhwini retired to his land beside the Anduin, and the Northmen of his race never again returned to their former homes.<ref name="Northmen" />

In the time of [[Forthwini]], the Éothéod were troubled again by raids into the south of their land, both up the river and through the [[Narrows]] of Mirkwood. The [[Lord of the Éothéod]] then warned King [[Ondoher]] that the Wainriders were recovering. The attack finally came around {{TA|1944|n}}, and men of the Éothéod fought with Ondoher. [[Faramir son of Ondoher]] refused to remain in [[Minas Tirith]] and joined a battalion of Éothéod, but was caught with a party of them as they retreated towards the [[Dead Marshes]]. The [[leader of the Éothéod]] did not manage to save him, and Faramir died in his arms before he found out that he was the Prince. He then went to join [[Minohtar]] at the head of the [[Southward Road|North Road]] in Ithilien. Eventually, the Wainriders were defeated by [[Earnil II]] at the [[Battle of the Camp]].<ref name="Northmen" />

In {{TA|1975}}<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1975, p. 1086</ref>, proud "princes of the Rhovanion" and tall and fair riders with [[horses]] from the [[Vales of Anduin]] joined the Gondorian forces of King [[Eärnil II]], which were led by his son prince [[Eärnur]] as a part of the [[Host of the West (Arnor)|Host of the West]], and fought against the forces of the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]] in the former lands of [[Arnor]] in the [[Battle of Fornost]].<ref>{{App|Gondor}}, entry for King Eärnil II, p. 1050</ref><ref group="note">The riders aren't specifically stated to be Éothéod in the text, but they may have been the reason why the Éothéod heard of the defeat of the Witch-king.</ref>

At that time, the Éothéod were well-known to Gondor as a people of good trust that provided Gondor with news about what happened in the region in which they lived.<ref name="Ride">{{UT|Ride}}</ref>

===Migration===
[[File:Douglas Chaffee - Framsburg.jpg|thumb|right|Douglas Chaffee - ''[[Framsburg]]''.]]
The Éothéod heard of the defeat of the Witch-king of Angmar and, led by their chieftain [[Frumgar]], moved from the middle vales of Anduin between the Carrock and the Gladden further north to settle near the sources of the Anduin and drove away the remnants of the people of Angmar on the east side of the Misty Mountains<ref name="firstparagraph" /> in {{TA|1977}}<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 1977, p. 1086</ref>. Their new land was north of Mirkwood, between the Misty Mountains and the [[Forest River]], and extended southward to the confluence of the two rivers [[Greylin]] and [[Langwell]],<ref name="Ride" /> the sources of the Great River [[Anduin]], near where the [[Grey Mountains|Ered Mithrin]] met the Misty Mountains<ref>{{UT|Map}}</ref>. They called their land '''Éothéod'''.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}: "Frumgar [...] led his people ''to Éothéod''."</ref> The Éothéod had their only fortified ''burg'' (town) at the confluence of the Greylin and the Langwell.<ref name="Ride" /> It is not known when the ''burg'' was established, but it is possible that it already happened during the rule of Frumgar. The Éothéod ''burg'' was presumably named ''[[Framsburg]]''<ref>{{webcite|website=TS|articleurl=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/2015/11/tolkiens-annotated-map-of-middle-earth-transcribed|articlename=Tolkien’s annotated map of Middle-earth transcribed|dated=10 November 2015|accessed=11 November 2015}}</ref><ref>[[Pauline Baynes]], [[A Map of Middle-earth]]</ref> after his son [[Fram]],<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. Ixv</ref> the famed slayer of the [[Long-worms|long-worm]] [[Dragons|Dragon]] [[Scatha]]<ref>{{App|Eorl}}, entry about Fram, pp. 1064-65</ref>.

After Fram, nothing is known of the leaders of Éothéod until much later, when [[Léod]] was killed trying to tame the [[Horses|horse]] [[Felaróf]], first of the ''[[Mearas]]'' of Rohan. His son and successor [[Eorl the Young]] tamed the horse, taking it into service as compensation for his father's life.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}, entry about Léod, Eorl and the ''mearas'', pp. 1064-65</ref>

After [[Cirion]] succeeded his father [[Boromir (Steward of Gondor)|Boromir]] as the Ruling [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward of Gondor]] in {{TA|2489}}, he always thought about the threat of invasion from the North. It was not until the winter of {{TA|2509}} was past that he became aware that a great movement against Gondor was being prepared. Gondor faced an attack by the evil ''[[Balchoth]]'', and Cirion sent messengers to the capital of Éothéod. King Eorl answered the call for help, and rode out with most of the Éothéod to help their allies of old, leaving only a few hundred warriors behind to protect his people. The Riders arrived just in time to help the army of Gondor to defeat the enemy in a [[Battle of the Field of Celebrant|battle]] at the [[Field of Celebrant]].<ref name="Ride" />

===The Rohirrim===
Three months later, Cirion gave the largely depopulated province of [[Calenardhon]] as a gift to Eorl and his people, and Eorl swore his [[Oath of Eorl|Oath]] of eternal friendship. Messengers were sent north, and the Éothéod moved from their homes to the plains of Calenardhon.<ref name="Eorl">{{UT|Eorl}}</ref>

The Éothéod renamed themselves ''Eorlingas'' ("people of Eorl")<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 407</ref> and named their country the '''Riddermark''' ("land of the knights"<ref>{{HM|RC}}, citing from the entry Riddermark in J.R.R. Tolkien's Index for the 1966 edition of ''The Lord of the Rings''p. 248</ref>) or simply the '''Mark'''<ref name="RC248">{{HM|UI}}, entry ''Riddermark'', p. 248</ref>, but in [[Gondor]] they were called the [[Rohirrim]] ("Horse-lords"<ref>{{App|Eorl}}, "the Rohirrim (that is, the Horse-lords)", p. 1063</ref>) and their country was called [[Rohan]] ("Horse-country"<ref>{{HM|UI}}, entry ''Rohan'', p. 247</ref>)<ref>{{App|Eorl}}, entry about King Eorl the Young, p. 1064</ref> in [[Númenórean Sindarin|Sindarin]]<ref name="Eorl306">{{UT|Eorl}}, p. 306</ref>.

==Etymology==
The name ''Éothéod'' is an [[Old English]] (Anglo-Saxon) name, which means "Horse-folk", "horse-people"<ref>{{UT|8e}}, Note 7</ref> or "Horse-land".<ref name="Languages">{{PM|Languages}}, manuscript F2, , $54, p. 53.</ref> It is a translation of the original [[Rohanese]] word ''Lohtûr'', which contains the element ''loho-'' or ''lô-'' ("horse").<ref name="Languages" /> The name ''Éothéod'' consists of the Old English elements ''eoh'' ("horse") and ''théod'' ("people" or "land").<ref>{{UT|8e}}, Note 36</ref>
