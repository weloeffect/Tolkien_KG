'''Anborn''' was a [[Rangers of Ithilien|Ranger of Ithilien]].

==History==
He was one of the Rangers of Ithilien in the company under [[Faramir]] who were on a mission to ambush the [[Haradrim]] in [[North Ithilien]]. He had been left behind as a scout near the [[Harad Road]]. Just before he returned to [[Henneth Annûn]] he saw [[Gollum]] lurking among the trees, yet he mistook him for a wild beast. He did not shoot him because Faramir had commanded his men not to slay wild beasts for no purpose.<ref>{{TT|Window}}</ref>

Later, Anborn answered Faramir's question as to what was in the [[Forbidden Pool]] below [[Henneth Annûn]], saying that the creature was not a bird since it had four limbs and dove manwise. He offered to shoot it with his bow, at Faramir's command. Faramir stayed his hand and had Anborn guide Frodo to the banks. When [[Gollum]] was captured, Anborn was told to guard the creature, but to treat him well.<ref name="pool"/>
