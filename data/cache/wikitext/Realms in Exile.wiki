The '''Realms in Exile''' were the two kingdoms established by [[Elendil]] and his sons after the [[Downfall of Númenor]]. Often called the '''Kingdoms of the Dúnedain''', it was the collective name for '''[[Arnor]]''' and '''[[Gondor]]''', the North-Kingdom and South-kingdom of the [[Dúnedain]] in the [[Westlands]] of [[Middle-earth]]. 

==History==
===Foundation===
After the [[Downfall of Númenor]] in {{SA|3319}}, the [[Great Sea]] cast up a handful of survivors on the shores of [[Middle-earth]].<ref name="SA" /> These were [[Elendil]] and his sons [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]], the last leaders of the [[Faithful]], who had fled from the port of [[Rómenna]] and were aboard ship when [[Númenor]] was swallowed by the [[Sea]]. The raging waters that followed the [[Downfall of Númenor|Downfall]] had driven their ships eastward until they came to the ruined shores of [[Middle-earth]].<ref name="numenor" /> There they established in the North-west the Númenorean realms in exile, [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]], in {{SA|3320}}.<ref name="SA">{{App|SA}}</ref>

[[Elendil]] and his people landed in [[Lindon]] and from there they spread out across [[Eriador]].<ref name="rings" /> Their great cities were at [[Annúminas]] on [[Nenuial]], and [[Fornost]] on the [[North Downs]],<ref name="rings" /> and they thus established a realm that came to be known as [[Arnor]], "Land of the King", because [[High King (Dúnedain)|High King]] [[Elendil]] dwelt there by [[Lake Evendim]].<ref name="numenor">{{App|Numenor}}</ref>

[[Elendil]]'s sons [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]] were driven southwards by the [[Sea]], and found their way at last up through the [[Mouths of Anduin]] into the [[Great River]] in a region where a great [[Númenórean]] port, [[Pelargir]], had stood for centuries. They founded their own southern realm in this region, named [[Gondor]], "Land of Stone", for the great feats of stonework they performed. Their main city was named [[Osgiliath]], built on the river on which they had entered their new land, but each of the brothers also had a fortress of their own: [[Minas Ithil]] for [[Isildur]] and [[Minas Anor]] for [[Anárion]].<ref name="rings" />

===Division===
The Númenórean Realms formed the [[Last Alliance]] with the [[Elves]] against [[Sauron]]. During that [[War of the Last Alliance|War]], [[Anarion]] and [[Elendil]] were killed. [[Isildur]] succeeded to the [[High King (Dúnedain)|High Kingship]], but his loss at the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]] caused a division between the two realms. At that time, [[Isildur]]'s nephew [[Meneldil]] became [[King of Gondor]] in his own right, and the two kingdoms would remain separate until the time of [[Aragorn Elessar]], more than three thousand years later.<ref name="rings">{{S|Rings}}</ref>

===Attempts of reunification===
It was not until the time of [[Araphant]] of [[Arthedain]] and [[Ondoher]] of [[Gondor]] when they took up counsel together after long silence and estrangment. Then, it was determined that [[Sauron|one single power and will]] was directing attacks against the Realms in Exile. In {{TA|1940}},  [[Arvedui]], the son of King [[Araphant]] of Arthedain, wed [[Fíriel]], the daughter of King [[Ondoher]] of Gondor, thus reuniting the [[House of Isildur]] and the [[House of Anárion]]. However, they could not profit from the new-formed alliance as [[Angmar]] and the [[Wainriders]] reappeared simultaneously.<ref name="gondor">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

[[Ondoher]] would prove to be last in a direct line of kings when he was slain in battle with the [[Wainriders]], alongside his sons. Hoping to save [[Arnor]] from [[Angmar]], [[Arvedui]] staked his claim to the [[King of Gondor|kingship of Gondor]], by right of his descent from [[Isildur]] and by that of his wife, mentioning also the ancient [[Law of Succession in Númenor]]. The [[Council of Gondor]] refused (to the [[Gondorians]] the [[Arthedain|remnant]] of [[Arnor]] seemed an insignificant despite its great heritage) and gave the crown to [[Eärnil II|Eärnil]] instead, the commander of the [[House of Anárion|royal house]] who defeated the [[Wainriders]]; he maintained good relations with [[Arthedain]], promising them aid. [[Arvedui]] did not press his claim  for he had neither the power nor the will to oppose the choice of the [[Dúnedain of Gondor]].<ref name="gondor" /> 

[[Arnor]]'s strength was fast dwindling when in {{TA|1973}} now-King [[Arvedui]] sent a message to [[Eärnil II|Eärnil]] that they were in great straits, and that [[Angmar]] was preparing it final assault. [[Eärnil II|Eärnil]], accordingly, mustered a great army under the command of his son [[Eärnur]]. The [[Gondorians|Gondorian]] force put to sea, but would not arrive before [[Angmar]] destroyed the [[North-kingdom]].<ref>{{App|Eriador}}</ref> Even so, the descendants of [[Arvedui]] never forgot his claim,<ref name="gondor" /> and when the line of [[Kings of Gondor|Kings]] failed in [[Gondor]], it was rumored that the Northern line still wandered in secrecy.<ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref>

===Final reunification===
{{main|Reunited Kingdom}}
After the ultimate defeat of the [[Dark Lord]] in the [[War of the Ring]], [[Isildur's Heir]] [[Aragorn II Elessar]] came forward and reclaimed the [[High King (Dúnedain)|High Kingship]], once again reuniting the Númenórean Realms after more than three thousand years.<ref name="rings" />
