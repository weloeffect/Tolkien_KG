}}'''Liz Danforth''' (born [[16 November]] [[1953]]) is an American fantasy artist, author and librarian. In the 1980s and 1990s, Danforth was commissioned by [[Iron Crown Enterprises]] to create illustrations for ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'' and to make card art for the ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]''.

While generally working in oils and mixed media, time constraints often led her to use ink and acrylics when doing card art.<ref name=CCGA>{{CCGA|entry=Danforth, Liz}}, pp. 110-111</ref>
