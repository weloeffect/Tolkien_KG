'''Peter C. Fenlon, Jr.''' (born [[1955]]) is an American table-top game designer/author and illustrator. He was the former president and one of the founders of [[Iron Crown Enterprises]], and contributed extensively to the [[Middle-earth Role Playing]] game.

In the late 1990s, Pete Fenlon and [[Coleman Charlton]], his long-time colleague from ICE, joined the Mayfair Game company.<ref>[http://www.mayfairgames.com/ Mayfair Games web site]</ref>

==The Fenlon Style==

Most of the regional maps were designed by Pete Fenlon at the scale 1’’ = 20 miles. Infographic by [[User:Airyn|Airyn]] (2025).]]
As an illustrator, Fenlon is especially known for his maps of [[Middle-earth]]. These were a large-scale map of the continent of Middle-earth (first released in [[1982]] as ''[[An Artist's Interpretation of Middle Earth]]'') and several smaller-scale maps of different regions of Middle-earth (most of whom were printed in ''[[Northwestern Middle-earth Map Set]]''). The smaller-scale maps were often included as separate color fold-outs with the [[Middle-earth Role Playing|MERP]] 1st Ed. modules. With MERP 2nd Ed., no new maps were released.

Fenlon's maps have continued to have an explicit influence on later Middle-earth gaming cartographers (e.g., [[Thomas Morwinsky]] and [[Sampsa Rydman]]), and his continental map has been discussed and revised in the magazines ''[[Other Hands]]''<ref>''[[Other Hands]]'' July 2000</ref> and ''[[Other Minds]]''.<ref>''[[Other Minds]]'', issue 1 and issue 2</ref>

The characteristical maps of Fenlon have even created an expression known as 'Fenlon Style maps'. In January 2008, the ''Cartographer's Annual'' released a Pete Fenlon style pack for use with ProFantasy Software cartography tools.<ref>[http://sub.profantasy.com/2008/january08.html The Cartographer's Annual Vol. 2] (external link)</ref>
