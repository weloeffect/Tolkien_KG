==Summary==
Christopher Tolkien was in an RAF training camp in [[South Africa]] since January, and his father wrote regularly.

The fragment had three trivial subjects. Tolkien started his letter telling about the return of the "Useless Quack", [[Robert Havard]], who had joined the Navy medical corps and was on leave in [[Oxford]]. He then told of [[C.S. Lewis]] and the inaccuracy of the press (concerning Mr. Lewis), and closed the letter with a remark about the weather. 

;In the expanded edition
in the first paragraph Tolkien shows delight that he has received airgraph messages from Christopher, and wonders whether he will visit Bloemfontein, where Tolkien was born.

Tolkien ends the letter with "God bless you."
