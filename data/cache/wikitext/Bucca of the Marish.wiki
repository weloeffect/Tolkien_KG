'''Bucca of the Marish''' was the first [[Thain]] of the [[Hobbits]] in [[Eriador]]. 

==History==
Around {{SR|379}}, some four years after the fall of the [[Arnor|North-kingdom]], the Hobbits of [[the Shire]] elected from their midst one Bucca of the [[Marish]] as the first Thain. He was to rule the land in the [[King of Arthedain|King]]'s stead. Little else is known about him, other than that he brought peace and prosperity to the Hobbits.<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref> 

His family became the [[Oldbucks]] and eventually the [[Brandybuck Family|Brandybucks]]. 

==Etymology==
The word '''Bucca''' is [[Old English]] for "buck", "male deer" or "he-goat" which is a translation of the original [[Westron]] name '''[[Gamba]]'''.<ref>{{HM|N}}</ref>
