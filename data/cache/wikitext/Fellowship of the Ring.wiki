The '''Fellowship of the Ring''', also known as the '''Company of the Ring''', was formed from nine members of the [[Free peoples]] during the [[War of the Ring]]. Its purpose was to take [[the One Ring]] to [[Mordor]], the only place where it could be destroyed.

==History==
[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Anger of the Mountain.jpg|thumb|240px|''The Anger of the Mountain'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
The Fellowship of the Ring was formed in [[Rivendell]] with the purpose to destroy the One Ring, and the only way to do so was to throw it into the [[Cracks of Doom]].<ref>{{FR|II2}}</ref> It was decided that nine walkers should contrast the [[Nazgûl]] of [[Sauron]] with Frodo as the [[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]] and Gandalf as the leader.

Although the purpose was fixed by the [[Council of Elrond]], it was not decreed how, in what manner and through which route this could be done; such details were left to the Fellowship's discretion. As a consequence, the Fellowship started with no detailed plan. One option was to go directly to [[Mount Doom]], the other was to ask help from Boromir's father, [[Denethor|Denethor II]].
The way of how to reach the East was a problem. After moving south from Rivendell, they encountered ''[[crebain]]'' on their arrival in [[Eregion|Hollin]]. Fearing that they were used as spies by [[Saruman]], the Fellowship spent the entire day in hiding, without a campfire.

When they had to pass the [[Misty Mountains]], Boromir proposed the [[Gap of Rohan]] (the way through which he journeyed to Rivendell); Gandalf insisted on passing through [[Moria]] but Aragorn thought the [[Redhorn Pass]] would be safer. However after attempting in vain to pass the blizzard, they followed Gandalf's option.<ref>{{FR|II3}}</ref>

After fighting with [[wolves]] and the [[Watcher in the Water]], they managed to open the [[Doors of Durin]] and enter Moria. 

There they found the [[Orcs]] who overran [[Balin's Colony]] years ago. They also saw [[Durin's Bane]], one of the [[Balrogs]] of [[Morgoth]], who devastated [[Moria]] in the beginning of the Third Age. To buy them time, Gandalf destroyed the [[Bridge of Khazad-dûm]] and both [[Maiar]] fell together into the abyss, while the Company escaped back to the light.<ref>{{FR|II4}}</ref>
Aragorn was appointed the head of the Company, and their next stop was to meet with [[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]], the elf-lords of [[Lothlórien]].<ref>{{FR|II6}}</ref> They stayed there for four weeks, resting and counseling for their plan and route. On their leave, the elves gave them several useful [[gifts of Galadriel|gifts]], which included [[Lembas]] bread and gave them boats to sail the [[Anduin]].<ref>{{FR|II8}}</ref>

Meanwhile, Saruman, who served Sauron, sent a band of [[Uruk-hai]] to capture the [[Halflings|halfling]] who bore the Ring and bring him to [[Isengard]].<ref>{{TT|III3}}</ref>
Frodo began to realize not only that [[Gollum|someone]] was following them, but also that the Ring was having a malevolent effect on some members of the party, especially Boromir.<ref>{{FR|II9}}</ref> It was he who tried to take the ring from him, after the passage through the [[Argonath]]. In the process, Frodo put on the ring to escape him, but he was followed by Sam. The rest of the Company was attacked by orcs while trying to find the Ring-bearer. Seeing no other halfling, the Orcs succeeded in capturing Merry and Pippin, killing Boromir, who tried to protect them.<ref>{{FR|II10}}</ref>
And so, the Fellowship was broken, but not yet disbanded. Frodo decided to go to Mordor himself, but Sam followed him down the [[Emyn Muil]].<ref>{{TT|IV1}}</ref> Aragorn, with Gimli and Legolas, (the "[[Three Hunters]]") decided to follow the Orcs into [[Rohan]] and rescue Pippin and Merry.<ref>{{TT|III1}}</ref> Unknown to them all, Gandalf had been resurrected and visited Lothlórien after them.<ref>{{TT|III5}}</ref>

After many adventures the eight remaining members of the Fellowship reunited after the downfall of Sauron.<ref>{{RK|VI4}}</ref>  When King [[Théoden]]'s funeral escort set out from [[Minas Tirith]], all eight journeyed together until they met [[Treebeard]] at [[Orthanc]].  There Gimli and Legolas departed to visit the deep places of [[Fangorn Forest]] on their way to their own homes, and Aragorn declared that the Fellowship of the Ring was at last ended.<ref name="Partings">{{RK|VI6}}</ref>

==Inspiration==
The notion of the number nine balancing nine evils (here, the Ringwraiths), is a motif seen in literature, as in the famous [[Old English]] ''[[Wikipedia:Nine Herbs Charm|Nine Herbs Charm]]'', where nine herbs are used to remedy nine contagions or venoms that go through the land.<ref>{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.tolkiensociety.org/ed/study_a_s_2.html|articlename=Tolkien Society Anglo-Saxon Study Pack 2|dated=2006|website=[http://www.tolkiensociety.org The Tolkien Society]}}</ref> Additionally, Tolkien chose the 25th of March as the date of the destruction of the One Ring, due to his Catholic Faith, as this is widely believed to have been the day of the death of [[Wikipedia:Jesus Christ|Jesus Christ]].<ref>{{webcite|author=Kaitlyn Facista|articleurl=https://www.teawithtolkien.com/blog/2017/2/11/the-significance-of-march-25th|articlename=The Ring & The Cross: Why March 25th is the Most Important Date of all History|dated=21 March 2017|website=[https://www.teawithtolkien.com/ Tea With Tolkien]|accessed=8 May 2025}}</ref> Furthermore, Tolkien noted in ''Nomenclature'' that the date the Ring was destroyed was purposefully chosen. It coincides with the feast of Annunciation or Lady Day.

==Terminology==
Though usually called '''Fellowship of the Ring''' in adaptations and by fans, the actual term is not used in full until the chapter "[[Many Partings]]", when [[Aragorn]] disbanded it.<ref name="Partings"/> In the story itself, they are usually referred to as the '''Fellowship''', the '''Company of the Ring''' (more so than ''Fellowship''), and the '''Nine Walkers''' (in opposition of the [[Nazgûl|Nine Riders]] who pursued them).
