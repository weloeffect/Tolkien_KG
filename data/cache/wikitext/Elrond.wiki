<center>{{quote|But my memory reaches back even to the [[Elder Days]]. [[Eärendil]] was my sire, who was born in [[Gondolin]] before its [[Fall of Gondolin|fall]]; and my mother was [[Elwing]], daughter of [[Dior]], son of [[Lúthien]] of [[Doriath]].

'''Elrond''' was the [[half-elven]] son of [[Eärendil]] and [[Elwing]], the father of [[Arwen]], and the Lord of [[Rivendell]] who consistently fought against [[Sauron]] throughout the Second and Third Ages. He was the twin brother of [[Elros]], who later became the first king of [[Númenor]].<ref name="Earendil">{{S|Earendil}}</ref>

Having been born in [[Beleriand]] towards the end of the [[First Age]], Elrond ever opposed [[Sauron]] and strove against him throughout the [[Second Age]], helping to bring about Sauron's defeat in the [[War of the Last Alliance]] as [[Gil-galad]]'s herald. Elrond inherited Gil-galad's Elven ring [[Vilya]], and during the [[Third Age]] he fought against the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]] and, as a member of the [[White Council]], expelled the Necromancer from [[Dol Guldur]] (who was Sauron in another guise). Towards the end of the Third Age, he was the foster-father to [[Aragorn]] as he had been to Arathorn before him. Aragorn went on to marry Elrond's daughter Arwen. After the destruction of [[the One Ring]], Elrond sailed west with [[Gandalf]], [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]], and [[Galadriel]]; their passing marked the end of the Third Age and the beginning of the [[Fourth Age|Fourth]].

Elrond is one of the most prominent, significant and recognisable characters in [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s legendarium, appearing in ''[[The Hobbit]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and ''[[Unfinished Tales]]''. He was critical to providing [[Thorin and Company]] with the information they needed to enter the [[Lonely Mountain]], and the [[Council of Elrond]] brought about the creation of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]], which ultimately resulted in the destruction of the One Ring and the final defeat of Sauron.

==History==
===First Age===
Elros and Elrond were born in the [[Mouths of Sirion|Havens of Sirion]] during the darkest days of the First Age, when the forces of [[Morgoth]] controlled most of [[Beleriand]]. When the twins were just six years old, the [[Sons of Fëanor]], bound by their [[Oath of Fëanor|Oath]], assaulted the Havens in the [[Third Kinslaying]], since they desired the [[Silmaril]] on the [[Nauglamír]] held by Elwing. Eärendil was at sea, and Elwing escaped with the Nauglamír and jumped into the sea.<ref name="Earendil" /> [[Maedhros]] and [[Maglor]], the only Sons of Fëanor to survive the assault upon the Havens, took Elros and Elrond as captives<ref name="Earendil" /> and abandoned them in a cave with a fall of water over the entrance instead of killing them.<ref name="L211">{{L|211}}, answer to Question 4</ref> But Maglor took pity upon Elrond and Elros and rescued them, and a mutual love grew between Maglor and the young twins afterwards.<ref name="Earendil" /> Elrond was given the name "Elf of the cavern" or "star-dome" (see [[#Etymology|Etymology]]), because Elrond was found in the cave.<ref name="L211" />
[[File:Tuuliky - Little Half-elf.jpg|thumb|left|Maglor raises Elrond. Art by [[:Category:Images by Tuuliky|Tuuliky]]]]

Following the [[War of Wrath]], because of his Half-elven heritage, the [[Valar]] gave Elrond and his brother a choice to be counted among the kindred of Elves or Men. Elrond chose to belong to the [[Firstborn]], while Elros chose to become mortal.<ref name="Earendil" /> Elros voyaged over the sea to Númenor following the star of Eärendil;<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref> whereas Elrond remained among the Elves and carried on the lineage of King [[Elwë]].<ref>{{PM|XII}}</ref> Elrond subsequently remained in [[Lindon]] with [[Gil-galad]], where he became known as a healer and lore-master.

===Second Age===
A fair being calling himself [[Annatar]], emissary of the Valar, came seeking entrance to Lindon during the Second Age. Elrond and Gil-galad sensed that he was not what he seemed, and denied him. They were correct, as proven in the later [[War of the Elves and Sauron]]. 
[[File:Anke Eißmann - Gil-galad sends Elrond to aid Celebrimbor.jpg|thumb|''Gil-galad sends Elrond to aid Celebrimbor'' by [[Anke Eißmann]]]]
In {{SA|1695}}, Gil-galad sent Elrond to aid Eregion. Elrond's forces came too late and proved too small to defend Eregion. While Sauron sent most of his army west to attack Lindon, he left a strong detachment behind to contain Elrond. In [[Second Age 1697|two years]], Eregion [[Sack of Eregion|was laid waste]] and Elrond, along with the surviving Noldor, ran the risk of being overun, when [[Dwarves|Durin's folk]] of [[Khazad-dûm]] attacked Sauron's rear guard, turning Sauron's attention to these new foes. This allows Elrond and the remaining Noldor to flee far north. There, he established the stronghold of [[Rivendell|Imladris]].<ref name="UTC">{{UT|Concerning}}</ref><ref>{{App|SA}}</ref>

Many more refugees joined Elrond's host as Sauron ravaged Eriador during the course of the war. By {{SA|1700}}, Imladris, despite being [[First Siege of Imladris|besieged]], was the only part of [[Eriador]] not under Sauron's control. It was liberated by [[Gil-galad]]'s and [[Tar-Minastir]]'s forces. After Sauron's defeat, a Council was held at that time, establishing that Imladris should be maintained as an Elvish stronghold, and appointing Elrond as Gil-galad's vice-regent in Eriador, passing the Ring [[Vilya]] to him.<ref>{{UT|6}}</ref>

Elrond marched with Gil-galad and [[Elendil]] during the [[War of the Last Alliance]], serving as Gil-galad’s herald. He was present during the [[Battle of Dagorlad|last battle]] of that war, witnessing the deaths of Gil-galad and Elendil. When [[Isildur]] cut [[the One Ring]] from Sauron’s hand at the conclusion of the battle, he and [[Círdan]] advised Isildur to destroy the Ring, but Isildur refused their counsel. Elrond subsequently returned to Rivendell, which prospered in the coming years with the aid of the Ring of Air, [[Vilya]], that Elrond had received from Gil-galad. 

It has been argued that, following Gil-galad’s death, Elrond had the right to become High King of the Noldor, but he never claimed the title. Indeed, after the Second Age ended, there were very few Noldor left in Middle-earth for there to be a king over.{{fact}}

===Third Age===
Following Isildur's death, Elrond received the shards of [[Narsil]], which he preserved for many years. He began his long tradition of fostering the heirs of Isildur by helping to raise Isildur's son [[Valandil (King of Arnor)|Valandil]], who had been left in Rivendell during the War of the Last Alliance. 

In {{TA|109}}, Elrond married [[Celebrían]], the daughter of [[Galadriel]] and [[Celeborn]]. Their first children, the twins [[Elladan]] and [[Elrohir]], were born in {{TA|130|n}}, and their daughter [[Arwen]] in {{TA|241|n}}.<ref name="AppB2" /> 

During the late reign of [[Arveleg I]], [[Second Siege of Imladris|Rivendell was besieged by Angmar]]. After an incursion by [[Angmar]] into Eriador in {{TA|1409}}, the Elvenfolk of Rivendell joined those of Lindon in subduing the power of the [[Witch-king]] for many years.<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref>

Centuries later, when the Northern Kingdom fell, Elrond took the other heirlooms of Arnor (the [[Sceptre of Annúminas]] and the [[Ring of Barahir]]) into his keeping, holding them for the one who would eventually be able to reclaim the throne of [[Arnor]].

Elrond, along with others of the [[Wise]], was joined by the [[Wizards|Wizard]] [[Gandalf]], who was sent by the Valar from the West. As they decided, Gandalf invaded [[Dol Guldur]]. The Necromancer withdrew and the [[Watchful Peace]] began. In {{TA|2463}}, the Wise formed the [[White Council]] with the Wizard [[Saruman]] as its head.
[[File:Angus McBride - Dol Guldur.jpg|thumb|left|''Dol Guldur'' by [[Angus McBride]]]]
Elrond was later separated from his wife when she was taken by [[Orcs]]. Their sons rescued her, but Elrond was unable to heal her mentally, and she decided to leave for the [[Uttermost West|West]] in {{TA|2510|n}}.

In {{TA|2851}}, the White Council met to decide whether to act on Gandalf's discovery of the identity of the [[Necromancer]] as Sauron, but [[Saruman]] dissuaded the others from acting upon Gandalf's revelation.

In {{TA|2933}}, Elrond took [[Aragorn]] as his foster-son in Rivendell, and had Arwen live in [[Lothlórien]] with her grandmother.

Elrond named Aragorn ''[[Estel]]'' ("Hope") and concealed his heritage from him until he came of age. When Aragorn became an adult, Elrond gave him the [[Ring of Barahir]] and the shards of Narsil, foreseeing that Aragorn might be the one to claim the thrones of [[Gondor]] and [[Arnor]]. When Aragorn fell in love with Arwen, Elrond revealed to him that Arwen shared the choice of the Half-elven, and that one or the other of them would ultimately be parted from her forever. Elrond insisted that Arwen could not marry Aragorn until he became king of both Gondor and Arnor.
[[File:The Hobbit - An Unexpected Journey - Elrond and Thrór's Map.jpg|thumb|Elrond examines [[Thrór's Map]] in ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]'']]
In {{TA|2941}}, Elrond welcomed [[Thorin and Company]] into his home, the [[Rivendell|Last Homely House]] before the wild. On Midsummer's Eve - the night before the [[Dwarves]], [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and [[Gandalf]] continued on their journey eastward - Elrond examined the swords which they had found in the trolls' cave. He read the runes and revealed that [[Thorin|Thorin's]] sword was called [[Orcrist]], the "Goblin-cleaver", and that Gandalf's sword was named [[Glamdring]], the "Foe-hammer". He told them that they were [[Elves|Elven]] swords from the ancient city of [[Gondolin]], destroyed long ago. He then looked at [[Thrór's Map]] and found that there were [[moon-letters]]. From the moon of that midsummer's eve he could read the words: 'five feet high the door and three may walk abreast' and 'stand by the grey stone when the thrush knocks and the setting sun with the last light of Durin's Day will shine upon the keyhole'. This information proved vital for Bilbo and the Dwarves to enter the [[Lonely Mountain]] through its secret entrance.<ref name="H3">{{H|3}}</ref>

During that same year, the [[White Council]] assailed [[Dol Guldur]] and rid [[Mirkwood]] of the Necromancer's presence.<ref name="AppB2">{{App|B2}}</ref> Upon Bilbo and Gandalf's return to Rivendell, Elrond and the grey wizard discussed this and the events of the Lonely Mountain. They both agreed that it would be better if the Necromancer were banished from the world altogether.<ref name="H19">{{H|19}}</ref>

The White Council last met in {{TA|2953}}, when Gandalf expressed his concerns that the One Ring was Bilbo's ring found in the [[Goblin-town]]. Saruman quieted him, insisting that the Ring had been swept out to sea.

====War of the Ring====
When [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] first left the Shire with the One Ring, it was always his intention to go to Rivendell to seek the advice of Elrond. Indeed, in his letter left at Bree, Gandalf counselled him to do so. After Elrond healed Frodo of his wound sustained at [[Weathertop]], he then hosted the feast that was held when Frodo recovered.
[[File:Jenny Dolfen - Glorfindel returns to Rivendell.jpg|thumb|left|''Glorfindel returns to Rivendell'' by [[Jenny Dolfen]]]]
Elrond presided at the [[Council of Elrond]]. During that meeting, he narrated what he knew of the history of Isildur and the Ring. He identified Aragorn as the [[Heir of Isildur]], and when Frodo ultimately volunteered to carry the Ring, Elrond affirmed that decision. Elrond also appeared to have selected the members of the Fellowship other than Frodo and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]], despite accepting [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] only reluctantly.

Later, Elrond sent his sons Elladan and Elrohir to join the [[Dúnedain]] Rangers who rode to [[Rohan]] to join Aragorn. Through Elrohir, Elrond advised Aragorn to take the [[Paths of the Dead]]. During the [[Last Debate]], Elrohir supported Aragorn’s decision to attack Mordor as a diversion to allow Frodo time to reach Mount Doom, saying that this was Elrond’s advice. 

After the passing of [[Sauron]], Aragorn was crowned as [[King of the West|King]] of the new [[Reunited Kingdom]] on [[1 May]], and according to his own promise Elrond escorted Arwen to [[Lothlórien]]. They arrived on [[20 May]] and Arwen went to [[Minas Tirith]] to wed Aragorn.<ref>{{App|Chief}}</ref> He parted from her in great sorrow.
[[File:Ted Nasmith - Departure at the Grey Havens.jpg|thumb|''Departure at the Grey Havens'' by [[Ted Nasmith]]]]
Elrond was one of the Elves who took the [[White Ship]] to [[Valinor]] along with Frodo, Gandalf, and the other [[Ring-bearers]]. The Third Age's end is marked by their departure.

==Characteristics==
{{Quote|He was as noble and fair as an elf-lord, as strong as a warrior, as wise as a wizard, as venerable as a king of dwarves, and as kind as summer.|''[[The Hobbit]]'', "[[A Short Rest]]"}}
Elrond seemed ageless, resembling neither old nor young. However, one could see in his face the memories and experiences of thousands of years. He looked venerable both like an old king, a wise wizard, and an experienced warrior in his prime.

Elrond is described as dark-haired, while his eyes were grey, shining like starlight. He could be seen wearing a circlet of silver.<ref name="meetings" /><ref>{{H|Rest}}</ref>

His parents were [[Eärendil]] and [[Elwing]]. He was thus [[Half-elven]]: Eärendil was the child of the mortal [[Tuor]] and the elf [[Idril]], while Elwing was the grandchild of [[Beren]] (a [[Man]]) and [[Lúthien]] (daughter of the Elf-king [[Thingol]] and the Maia [[Melian]]). Consequently, Elrond was descended from all three tribes of the Elves ([[Vanyar]] and [[Noldor]] through Idril, [[Sindar]] through Lúthien), a Maia, and all three houses of the [[Edain]] ([[House of Hador|Hador]], [[House of Haleth|Haleth]] and [[House of Bëor|Bëor]]).

==Etymology==
{{Pronounce|Elrond.mp3|Ardamir}}
In a letter from 1958, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] explained that ''Elrond'' is a [[Sindarin]] name that he was given because he was found in a cave, and that the name is a compound of ''eld>ell'', the Sindarin term for the High-Elven exiles, and ''rond'' based on primitive Elvish ''rondo'' meaning "cavern".<ref name="L211" /> In an essay that was probably written between 1959 and 1960, J.R.R. Tolkien translated the name as "Star-dome".<ref>{{WJ|Author}}, Note 26, second paragraph about Hadhodrond</ref><ref>{{S|Index}}, entry ''Elrond''</ref> The Sindarin elements are ''[[el]]'' ("star") and ''[[rond]]'' ("a vaulted or arched roof, the heavens").<ref name="Elements">{{S|Elements}}, entries ''êl'' and ''rond''</ref> In an essay on "The Problem of Ros" that was written in 1969 or later J.R.R. Tolkien translated the name as "star-dome, noting that it was given by [[Elwing]] in memory of the [[Menelrond]], the Hall of the Throne of Elwë.<ref>{{PM|Ros}}</ref> ''Elrond'' has also been translated as "Vault of Heaven".<ref name="Etym">{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 384</ref> In a letter from 1972, J.R.R. Tolkien wrote that the name Elrond means "The vault of stars".<ref>{{L|345}}</ref>

His [[Quenya]] name was most likely '''''Elerondo''''',<ref>[[Petri Tikka]], "[http://www.geocities.com/petristikka/elvish/PE17.html Quenya words in ''Parma Eldalambaron'' 17]"</ref> isolated from the patronymic ''Elerondiel'' ("[[Arwen|Daughter of Elrond]]").<ref>{{PE|Eldarin}}, p. 56</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
The name '''Elrond''' first appears in a draft for ''[[The Fall of Númenor (chapter)]]'', written about the same time as ''The Hobbit'' (before [[1937]]). There he is mentioned to be the son of [[Eärendel]], heir of the [[House of Hador]], who because of his mortal blood chose to remain in the [[Great Lands]] and became the leader of the Elves in the remnant of [[Beleriand]]. There he allied with the Faithful [[Amroth]] (a precursor of Elendil) against [[Sûr]] (Sauron).<ref>{{LR|P1II2}}</ref> In a rewrite of the same text, Elrond becomes the first [[King of Númenor]] instead, the builder of the city of Númenos, and is a mortal (which means that the text was likely written before ''The Hobbit'', as he appears alive there). It is Gil-galad who fights Sauron. With the conception of Elros, Tolkien added a later note that considered making Elrond stay with Gil-galad or return to Middle-earth.<ref>{{LR|P1II3}}</ref>

Elrond was then "borrowed" or imported into ''[[The Hobbit]]''. Subsequently he, along with [[Gandalf]], became one of the only characters to appear in all three of ''[[The Silmarillion]]'', ''[[The Hobbit]]'', and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

In the chapter "[[A Short Rest]]" of ''The Hobbit'', it is said of Elrond that he 
{{blockquote|...was an elf-friend — one of those people whose fathers came into the strange stories before the beginning of History, the wars of the evil goblins and the elves and the first men in the North. In those days of our tale there were still some people who had both elves and heroes of the North for ancestors, and Elrond the master of the house was their chief.|''[[The Hobbit]]'', "[[A Short Rest]]"}} 
Note that in this description he is not identified as an Elf himself, emphasizing his elf-friend (= Edain) heritage. In the subsequent fleshing out of his background, it is never mentioned that he was ever the "chief" of the people who came from "both elves and heroes of the North" (which would apply to the [[Half-elven]] or rather the [[Dúnedain of Arnor]]).

===Films===
'''1971: [[Sagan om Ringen (1971 film)|''Sagan om Ringen'' (1971 film)]]:'''
:Elrond is given the title 'alvkungen', which translates to 'Elf king'. After [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo’s]] recovery from the [[Morgul-wound]], those present at [[Rivendell]] hold a feast in celebration. The [[Council of Elrond]] convenes the next day and Elrond talks of the [[Elves]] battles against [[Sauron]]. Frodo asks how he can remember this, noting that [[Gil-galad]] died over three thousand years ago. Elrond tells Frodo that he has lived in [[Middle-earth]] for Three [[Ages]] and that he was present for the [[Siege of Barad-dûr|defeat of Sauron]] and watched as [[Isildur]] cut [[The One Ring]] from Sauron’s hand and took the Ring for himself. After [[Gandalf]] tells of how he escaped from [[Saruman]], Elrond tells the Council of their chief goal: Bring the Ring to [[Mordor]] and destroy it in the fire in which it was created. Elrond reminds them that destroying the Ring would bring peace for all of Middle-earth and that it is imperative that they put their lives on the line to bring about peace. After the members of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] are decided and they begin to prepare for their journey, Elrond farewells Gandalf and wishes him luck on their quest. 

'''1977: [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|''The Hobbit'' (1977 film)]]:'''
:Elrond appears in [[Rivendell]], crowned with a ring of stars. He feeds the [[Thorin and Company|Dwarves]], and identifies [[Orcrist]] and [[Glamdring]]. He needs little time to identify the latter. He is shown with a beard, although Tolkien clearly states [[Elves]] do not have beards. His voice was provided by [[Cyril Ritchard]].

'''1978: [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1978 film)]]:'''
:Elrond, voiced by [[André Morell]], appears at the [[Council of Elrond]]. He sits on a raised chair, and narrates the scene. Not until [[the One Ring]] is brought forward does he take an active part.

'''1980: [[The Return of the King (1980 film)|''The Return of the King'' (1980 film)]]:'''
:Elrond appears roughly the same as in the first of [[Rankin/Bass]]' films. The premise of the film, a [[minstrel of Gondor]] who tells the tale of "Frodo of the Nine Fingers, and the Ring of Doom" at [[Bilbo Baggins]]' 129th birthday party in Rivendell, allows Elrond to be a member of the audience, and then sails west, with [[Gandalf]] and the two allowed Bilbo and [[Frodo Baggins]] (his nephew) come because of their service in Middle-earth and being friends. Because Cyril Ritchard had passed away not long after completing his work on ''The Hobbit'', Rankin/Bass regular [[Paul Frees]] took over as his voice.

:Elrond, played by [[Hugo Weaving]], first appears in the prologue as a commander of the army of [[Gil-galad]] in the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. A later flashback scene shows him actually taking [[Isildur]] into [[Mount Doom]], trying to persuade him to destroy the Ring. [[Círdan]] is omitted.

:As in the book, Elrond heals [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]]'s wound from [[Weathertop]]. Elrond then has a conversation with [[Gandalf]], discussing the many challenges that face them. Elrond argues that the Ring cannot remain in Rivendell (in the film, Frodo appears to have thought that he would be able to leave the Ring there). He also expresses his doubts about the race of [[Men]], and gives the first hints about [[Aragorn]]'s real identity. In the Council of Elrond, Elrond himself is the one who argues that the only option is to destroy the Ring. He does not select the Fellowship, but accepts those who volunteer.

:Elrond gains two additional scenes in the [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (extended edition)|Extended Edition]] of the movie. In the first, he talks with Aragorn beside the grave of Aragorn’s mother. Elrond encourages the reluctant Aragorn to accept his fate of becoming [[Kings of Gondor|king]]. In the next scene, Elrond blesses the departing [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]].

'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''
:Though he had no scenes in the book, Elrond appears mainly in conversations with [[Arwen]], whose role is also greatly expanded. In a flashback, Aragorn remembers Elrond telling him to abandon his love for Arwen, allowing her to sail to [[Valinor]]. Aragorn attempts to do this, but Arwen denies him. In another scene, Elrond persuades Arwen that she should sail to Valinor, describing what will happen if she remains and Aragorn dies. Elrond then has a [[ósanwe|telepathic]] communication with [[Galadriel]] discussing the [[War of the Ring|war]] that is about to start. He apparently suggests that she send an army to [[Helm's Deep]] to aid the [[Rohirrim|Men]] there, since when [[Haldir]] arrives at Helm's Deep he says that he brings "word from Elrond of Rivendell."

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:In the final installment of Jackson's film series, Elrond's first scene is with Arwen, who has decided not to sail after all, but to return. Although he senses that she is dying, Elrond acknowledges her choice. At her suggestion, he has the [[shards of Narsil]] [[Andúril|re-forged]], then carries the new sword to Aragorn at [[Dunharrow]]. He finally convinces Aragorn to accept his destiny, and advises him to take the [[Paths of the Dead]]. Later, Elrond escorts Arwen to [[Minas Tirith]] for [[Aragorn]]'s coronation, and he finally sails to Valinor with the [[Ring-bearers]].

'''2012-14: [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' (film series)]]:'''
:Hugo Weaving reprises the role of Elrond.<ref name="IMCasting">{{webcite|author=[[Ian McKellen]]|articleurl=http://www.mckellen.com/cinema/hobbit-movie/110510.htm|articlename=2 Elves and another Wizard|dated=10-May-2011|website=[http://www.mckellen.com/ Ian McKellen's website]|accessed=23-Dec-2011}}</ref> As in the book, he identifies Gandalf's and [[Thorin]]'s respective swords, as well as translating the [[Moon-letters|runes]] on Thorin's [[Thrór's Map|map]] in the [[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey|first]] film. There is an additional scene where Elrond meets with the [[White Council]]. Like [[Saruman]], Elrond is somewhat skeptical of Gandalf's claims, deeming the Quest of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] unwise. However, he is clearly alarmed by Gandalf's revealing of the [[Morgul-knife|Morgul blade]] from [[Dol Guldur]]. Elrond is seen again in the [[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies|third]] of these films where he participates in the [[Attack on Dol Guldur|battle]] of Dol Guldur, joining Saruman and Galadriel in fighting off the [[Nazgûl]].
