'''Calimehtar''' was a nobleman of the Royal House of [[Gondor]], the younger son of King [[Calmacil (King of Gondor)|Calmacil]].

==History==
Calimehtar was the younger brother of the famous [[Rómendacil II]]. His direct impact on history was negligible, and indeed he is not mentioned in the annals of his own time at all. He had a lasting legacy, though, in the shape of his grandson [[Castamir]], who used the fact of his descent from Calimehtar as a pretext for usurping the throne of Gondor during the bloody times known as the [[Kin-strife]].<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Calimehtar'' is [[Quenya]]. Its meaning is not glossed, but as Paul Strack explains it may mean "Bright Warrior" and may be a compound of ''[[cala]]'' ("light") and ''mehtar'' ("warrior"), but it could also be a compound of ''calima'' ("bright")<ref>{{L|211}}, answer to Question 1</ref> and ''[[ohtar]]'' ("warrior").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-2099306413.html|articlename=Q.
