'''Ferumbras Took III''' was the thirtieth [[Thain]] of [[the Shire]].

==History==
Ferumbras was the son of [[Thain]] [[Fortinbras Took II|Fortinbras II]] and [[Lalia Clayhanger]]. As Lalia outlived her husband, in accordance with [[Took Family|Took]] tradition she continued as matriarch of the family, and despite Ferumbras being Thain he was only accorded a small bachelor pad in [[Great Smials]]. He remained unmarried, and according to legend it was because no woman could stand living in with Lalia.<ref name="L214">{{L|214}}</ref>

Ferumbras attended [[Bilbo's Farewell Party]] in {{SR|1401}}. He died in the year {{SR|1415}}.<ref name="Took">{{App|Took}}</ref> As Ferumbras left no heir the Thainship passed to his second cousin, [[Paladin Took II]].<ref name="L214"/>

==Etymology==
[[Wikipedia:Ferumbras|Ferumbras]] is a name from the [[wikipedia:Roland|legends of Roland]], a corruption of Frankish ''fier à bras'', "brave arm".
