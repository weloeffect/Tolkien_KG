'''Éothain''' was a rider of [[Rohan]].

==History==
Éothain was a member of [[Éomer]]'s [[éored]] that overran the [[orcs]] who had captured [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] at the fringe of [[Fangorn Forest]], and encountered [[Aragorn]], [[Legolas]] and [[Gimli]] on [[30 February]], {{TA|3019}}. Éothain scoffed at the idea that [[Hobbits]] even existed, believing them to be nothing but [[Holbytla|a child's tale]], and argued against the gift of horses to [[Three Hunters|the three companions]].<ref>{{TT|III2}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In one of the last drafts of [[The Riders of Rohan]], Éothain was Éomer's squire,<ref>{{TI|XX}}, p. 401</ref> whereas in a later draft of [[The Ride of the Rohirrim]], he was the captain of Éomer's household éored.<ref>{{WR|3|VII}}, p. 352</ref> No reference to Éothain's rank in Éomer's éored is made in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.

==Etymology==
''Éothain'' contains the [[Old English]] elements ''Éoh'' ("warhorse") and ''[[Thain|thegn]]'' ("warrior, chieftain"). It was a rendition of a [[Rohanese]] name that was never recorded, though the first element is likely translated from ''lô''/''loh'', "war-horse".

'''[[1981]]: [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (1981 radio series)]]:'''
:[[John Livesey]] plays the part of Éothain.  Almost the whole of Éothain's dialogue from the book is retained in this production.  

'''[[2002]]: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''
:The name Éothain was given to [[Éothain (film character)|another character]], but a [[Decipher Card]] identifies one of Éomer's riders as Éothain.

'''2012: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Éothain is Éomer's cousin. He is first met in the [[Entwash Vale]] town of Eaworth as part of Éomer's [[éored]]. He later returns to his home town of [[Aldburg]] where he tasks the player with preparations for its defence.
