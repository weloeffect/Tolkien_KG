'''Fíriel''' was the third child and daughter of King [[Ondoher]] of [[Gondor]].<ref name="Gondor">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

==History==
Fíriel was wed to prince [[Arvedui]] of [[Arnor]] in {{TA|1940}} when Arvedui's father [[Araphant]] made an alliance with Ondoher.<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, 'Ondohir', p. 201</ref> The alliance proved fruitless, however. Neither side could send help to the other as both Kingdoms came under attack: Arnor by [[Angmar]] and Gondor by the [[Wainriders]].

During the [[Disaster of the Morannon]], Ondoher and his sons [[Artamir]] and [[Faramir (son of Ondoher)|Faramir]] were killed, which meant that according to the Law of [[Númenor]], Fíriel should have become the Ruling Queen. Arvedui referred to this ancient law, as well as the fact that he was a direct descendant of [[Isildur]], as arguments to claim the crown of Gondor, but he was refused.

Fíriel remained with her husband in the north, though her fate in the fall of Arthedain was never recorded. She did have a son, [[Aranarth]], who continued the line of [[Isildur]] and [[Anárion]].<ref name="Gondor"/>

== Legacy ==
However, approximately more than a millennium after her death,<ref>{{App|Chief}}, entry for May 1, 3019, p. 1095</ref> the Crown of Gondor finally returned to her descendants at the end of the [[War of the Ring]] when her descendant [[Aragorn II|Aragorn]] son of [[Arathorn II]],<ref>{{App|North}}, p. 1038</ref> claimed the Crown of Gondor as the King Elessar Telcontar.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, ''The North-kingdom and the Dúnedain'', p. 1043</ref>

==Etymology==
''Fíriel'' is [[Quenya]] for "mortal woman".<ref>{{AB|Preface}}</ref>
