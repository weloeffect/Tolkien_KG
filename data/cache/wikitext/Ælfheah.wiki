'''Ælfheah''' was one of the seven companions of [[Ælfwine]] on his voyages, according to the early version of the [[legendarium]] in the text called ''[[Ælfwine of England]]'' from ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', and the only one whose name was remembered afterwards.<ref name="Elf">{{LT2|VIb}}, pp. 315-6</ref>

== History ==
After much voyaging and searching for the [[Tol Eressëa|Island of the Elves]], Ælfheah was the one who advised Ælfwine to put an end to his quest and return to his home; however, soon after they spotted the lights coming from the West in [[Tol Eressëa]] - but a strong westerly wind pushed them back eastwards, except Ælfwine who jumped out of the ship and swam toward the isle.<ref>{{LT2|VIb}}, pp. 320-1</ref>

Ælfheah's final fate is uncertain, but he most likely died at sea, since it was said of all the seven companions of Ælfwine that eventually "[[Ulmo]] Lord of the Sea afterward took them to himself".<ref name="Elf"/>

== Etymology ==
The name ''Ælfheah'' is in [[Old English]] and consists of the elements ''ælf'' ("elf") + ''heah'' ("high").<ref>{{webcite|website=Behind the Name|articlename=Ælfheah|articleurl=http://www.behindthename.com/name/ae32lfheah}}</ref>

== Other names ==
An earlier name for the character was ''Gelimer'', possibly being a latinization of a [[wikipedia:Vandalic language|Vandalic]] name (exemplified by the King of the Vandals and Alans [[wikipedia:Gelimer|Gelimer]]),<ref>{{LT2|VIb}}, note 40, p. 332</ref> deriving from the [[wikipedia:Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''gailaz'' ("merry") + ''mērijaz '' ("famous, renowned").<ref>{{webcite|website=Wiktionary|articlename=Gelimer|articleurl=http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Gelimer}}</ref>

The name ''Gelimer'' was itself a change from an earlier form ''Helgor''.<ref>{{LT2|VIb}}, ''Changes made to names, and differences in names, in the texts of Ælfwine of England'', p. 334</ref>
