The '''House of Dol Amroth''' was a noble house of [[Gondor]] whose male heirs were the [[Princes of Dol Amroth]] descended from [[Galador]] the first prince.  Legend told that his father, [[Imrazôr]] [[the Númenórean]] married a [[Silvan Elves|Silvan Elf]] named [[Mithrellas]], and from that time forward the house and kin were noble by blood and fair in face and mind.<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, ''The Line of Dol Amroth'', p. 221</ref>

==Background and history==
A family of [[Faithful]] from [[Númenor]] had ruled over the land of [[Belfalas]] since the [[Second Age]]. This family of [[Númenóreans]] were akin to the [[Lords of Andúnië]], being related to [[Elendil]] himself and thus ultimately descending from the [[House of Elros]].<ref name="Cirion">{{UT|Cirion}}, Note 39</ref> After the [[Downfall of Númenor]] they had been given the title ''Prince of Belfalas'' by [[High King (Dúnedain)|High King]] [[Elendil]]<ref name="Cirion"/> and their land, now a fief of [[Gondor]], was called [[Dor-en-Ernil]]. He granted this family a noble title, making them the hereditary Princes of Belfalas.

One branch of their descendants removed to [[Lossarnach]].<ref name="Isen">{{UT|Isen}}</ref> [[Morwen Steelsheen]], a daughter of that family, married [[Thengel]] of [[Rohan]]. Through Morwen, both Thengel's heir [[Théoden]] and his grandson [[Éomer]] carried the blood of the ancient Princes of Belfalas.

One of those princes, [[Adrahil (Captain of the Left Wing)|Adrahil]], fought under [[King of Gondor|King]] [[Ondoher]] against the [[Wainriders]].<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}</ref><ref group=note>Adrahil is mentioned as a "Prince of Dol Amroth" in the narrative, but this is anachronistic as the city was named Dol Amroth much later. Cf. [[Adrahil (Captain of the Left Wing)#Other versions of the legendarium]]</ref>

==Genealogy==
