'''''Tolkien's Mighty Pen: How God Rules Middle Earth''''' is a [[2001]] book by C.N. Crum.

== From the publisher ==
{{blockquote|[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] is seen by many as the greatest fiction writer in history. His work resonates through generation after generation as it tackles the great questions of life. This work is an attempt to portray the decidedly [[Christianity|Christian]] nature of Tolkien's writing. The first part of the book examines the great theme of Tolkien's work, death and [[mortality]]. The second deals with the theology of Tolkien, a superb explanation of the great truths of Christianity. The third and fourth parts deal with Tolkien’s incredible examination of human nature and life on this Earth. The rich cast of characters that make up Middle Earth are examined, as are Tolkien’s literary skills. The reader is taken along on a fascinating journey through the most creative imagination ever and will find a deeper understanding of the mysteries of existence, and perhaps, as Tolkien himself intended, become a better person.}}
