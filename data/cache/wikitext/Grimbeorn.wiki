'''2006: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'':'''
:Despite not featuring in [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]], Decipher produced a card depicting the character. He was portrayed by sword smith Peter Lyon.

'''2014: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Grimbeorn is the lord of all Beornings and lives at his home, the [[Beorn's Hall|Beorninghús]], with his wife Gírta and three children: the eldest daughter Langhár, the middle son Sterkist and the youngest, who becomes the [[Beorning]] player's character after Grimbeorn sends them to find the Ranger [[Aragorn]] at the urging of [[Radagast]]. During the [[War of the Ring]] Grimbeorn visits the camp of Vindurhal in the [[High Pass]] of the [[Misty Mountains]], but returns home soon after. After the destruction of [[The One Ring]], Grimbeorn is visited by [[Gandalf]], [[Legolas]] and the player on their journey back to [[Gondor]] after a brief visit to the northern lands. Already annoyed by a number of visitors, Grimbeorn is then forced to host a much larger procession when [[Elrond]] and much of his house stay at his lodge on their way to [[Minas Tirith]] for [[Arwen]]'s wedding.
