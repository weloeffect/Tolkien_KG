'''Blind Guardian''' is a power metal band formed in the mid-1980s in Krefeld, Germany. The band takes inspiration from fantasy authors as well as traditional legends and epics. The 1998 album ''[[Nightfall in Middle-Earth]]'', most notably, is a concept album based on Tolkien's ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.

Beyond projects that came to fruition, the band was at some point under negotiations for soundtrack work for [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]]. They had also planned to release ''The Lord of the Rings'' orchestral music around [[2008]].<ref name="high">{{Webcite|articleurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402213457/http://www.highwiredaze.com/blind.htm|articlename=A New Twist in the Blind Guardian Legacy (Interview)|website=[https://web.archive.org/web/20120321083852/http://highwiredaze.com/ Highwire Daze]|accessed=27 June 2025}} (archived)</ref>
