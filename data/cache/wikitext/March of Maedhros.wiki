The '''March of Maedhros''' was a region in the northeastern borderlands of [[Beleriand]], between [[Dorthonion]] and [[Ered Luin]] and south of [[Lothlann]].<ref name="Map">{{S|Map}}</ref>  It was guarded by the [[Noldor]] under the general captaincy of [[Maedhros]].  The chief Stronghold of the March of Maedhros was [[Himring]], a fortress built by the [[Sons of Fëanor]] after the [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë|Kinslaying]].<ref>{{S|Return}}</ref>

==Description==
The area consisted of a series hills and plains. The hills, most notable in the eastern areas, were surrounding the Hill of [[Himring]], the capital fortress.<ref name="Map"/>

==History==
It was fortified by Maedhros after he moved his brothers and their people further east out of [[Hithlum]] to avoid any feuds with their kinsmen. He established himself on Himring. It was frequently attacked by the forces of Angband throughout the [[First Age]] in the Battles of Beleriand, generally because it lacked in natural fortification, until it was finally overrun during the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]].<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>
