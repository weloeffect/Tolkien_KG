The '''battle under the trees''' was a conflict fought on [[15 March]], {{TA|3019}}, as part of the [[War of the Ring]].<ref name="battle under trees">{{App|Great}}</ref> It was fought simultaneously with the second assault on [[Lórien]], a battle also fought against the forces of [[Dol Guldur]].

== Prelude==
[[Dol Guldur]] had recently become active<ref>{{App|TA}}</ref>(possibly under the power of [[Khamûl]], its former commander)<ref>{{UT|Hunt}}, p. 352, note #1</ref>
under the service of [[Sauron]]. On [[11 March]], Dol Guldur sent a force of Orcs against [[Lothlórien]].<ref name="battle under trees"/> Though acting as the first of [[assaults on Lothlórien|three assaults]], it ended in failure.

==The Battle==
On the 15 March, the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] took place in [[Gondor]].<ref>{{RK|Battle}}</ref> Not soon after its end, Orcs were sent from Dol Guldur to Lórien and the [[Woodland Realm]]. Another long battle then took place under the trees of Mirkwood when Thranduil's realm was invaded, and a great ruin of fire. In the end Thranduil took the victory and the Elves of Mirkwood won.<ref name="battle under trees"/>

At the same time, the Orcs sent to Lothlórien for a second time, once again failed the assault.<ref name="battle under trees"/>

== Aftermath ==
A third assault on Lórien was made on [[22 March]] and ended comparably to the others. On [[28 March]], [[Celeborn]] took Dol Guldur and [[Galadriel]] laid it bare, presumably by way of [[Nenya]].<ref name="battle under trees"/>

On [[6 April]], Celeborn and King [[Thranduil]] met in the midst of the forest and renamed it [[Eryn Lasgalen]], "wood of green leaves".  Celeborn took the land south of [[The Narrows]] for himself and named it [[East Lórien]], while Thranduil took all wood north of the [[Mountains of Mirkwood]]. They gave the middle of the wood to the [[Beornings]] and [[Woodmen]].<ref name="battle under trees"/>
