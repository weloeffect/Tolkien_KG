'''''The Return of the King''''' is the third of three volumes in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. It is preceded by ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' and ''[[The Two Towers]]''. ''The Return of the King'' was originally released on [[20 October]] [[1955]] in the United Kingdom. After the high demand of the previous volumes, this was released in significantly more copies (7000 in the UK and 5000 in the US).<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. xxxv</ref>

The volume is divided into two books, Book V and VI. The [[The Lord of the Rings Appendices|Appendices]] are included in the end.

==Title and structure==
Tolkien conceived of ''The Lord of the Rings'' as a single work comprising six sections he called "books" and extensive appendices. The original publisher made the decision to split the work into three parts, publishing the fifth and sixth books and the appendices in the final volume. For the two final "books" Tolkien suggested the titles ''[[The War of the Ring]]'' and ''[[The End of the Third Age]]'', which however weren't used in publication; but in the case of the third volume, he suggested '''''[[The War of the Ring]]''''' or '''''The Return of the King'''''.<ref name=l136>{{L|136}}</ref>

The chosen title refers to [[Aragorn]]'s assumption of the throne. Tolkien criticised it as giving away less of the story; but he was overruled by his publishers.

;Structure
The structure of ''The Return of the King'' mirrors somewhat that of ''The Two Towers'' in that the first section recounts the various adventures of several characters including a massive battle, and the second section resumes the quest of the [[Ring-bearers]].

==Synopsis — Book V==
[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - The Return of the King.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Tolkien's preliminary design for the dust-jacket of ''The Return of the King''.]]
The story begins as [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]] is in [[Rohan]], reunited with the remnants of the [[Fellowship of the Ring]]. He steals [[Saruman]]'s ''[[Palantíri|palantír]]'' and sees that [[Sauron]] will attack [[Minas Tirith]]. Then [[Gandalf]] delivers news to the [[Denethor|steward of Gondor]] that war is imminent.

Gandalf brings Pippin with him, who enters the service of the steward. Aragorn by his courage and leadership proves himself a worthy ruler of [[Men]]. He is destined to find a [[Oathbreakers|lost army]] of men now dead yet entrapped in a curse set forth long ago by their own disobedience, in the place known as the [[Paths of the Dead]].

The remnants of the Fellowship lead the forces of Gondor and Rohan in defence of Gondor's capital city, Minas Tirith, resulting in the cataclysmic [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. Those characters that manage to survive the battle are led by Aragorn on a assuredly suicidal feint-attack against the [[Black Gate]] of [[Mordor]], partly to distract Sauron from defending his other borders so that [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] can gain a clear passage into Mordor. Aragorn's company now surrounds the Black Gates of the Morannon exchanging idle words with the [[Mouth of Sauron]].

==Synopsis — Book VI==
In the meanwhile, the brave and loyal Samwise Gamgee (who for a short time has himself become the [[Ring-bearers|Ring-bearer]]) enables the long-suffering Frodo to navigate the barren wasteland of Mordor. For part of the way they are captured by a company of [[Orcs]] and must pretend to be Orcs before they are able to escape. The company, tired and half-alive, finally reach the [[Cracks of Doom]], where the [[The One Ring|One Ring]] is destroyed along with [[Gollum]], freeing [[Middle-earth]] from Sauron's power forever. This happens when Frodo at the last moment decides to keep the ring rather than destroy it, and is attacked by Gollum who bites off Frodo's finger to take the ring, trips, and falls into the lava while still holding the ring. Frodo and Sam are rescued by the giant [[Eagles]] who Gandalf rides to Mount Doom, from the Black Gates of Morannon. After Sauron is defeated, his armies at the Black Gates flee, and the men of Gondor and Rohan are victorious in the battle.

Aragorn is crowned [[High King]] of the [[Reunited Kingdom]] at Minas Tirith. After a series of goodbyes, the hobbits return home, only to find [[the Shire]] under the control of '[[Sharkey]]' who they find out is Saruman, diminished in power but not in malevolence. Merry and Pippin, now experienced warriors of Rohan and Gondor respectively, take the lead in setting things right again, and lead an uprising of [[Hobbits]] against Saruman, freeing the Shire. Time passes. The Shire heals, but Frodo does not. Eventually Frodo departs for the [[Aman|Undying Lands]] to find healing, along with [[Bilbo Baggins]], Gandalf and the [[Elves]]. Sam, Merry and Pippin watch them depart and return home in silence. Sam is greeted by his wife [[Rose Cotton|Rose]] and his daughter [[Elanor Gardner|Elanor]]. In the last line of the book Sam says to Rosie; "Well, I'm back".
