'''The Caverns of Isengard''' is the sixteenth scene of ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' and the twentieth scene of [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (extended edition)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (extended edition)]].

==Synopsis==
Gandalf sits atop the spire of [[Orthanc]]. He grabs a moth that is fluttering by and imparts a message to it before sending it away. Below, the ring of [[Isengard]] has been transformed into a foundry and breeding ground for new [[Orcs]] and the large scale production of equipment. Saruman watches on as new [[Uruk-hai]] are bred, including a formidible Uruk named [[Lurtz]].

==Differences==
*Lurtz is an original character to this adaptation.
*Gandalf does not send a message to the outer world at Orthanc.
*The entirety of this scene is fabricated for the movie in order to depict Saruman's rise as a power, though it largely adheres to how Tolkien describes Isengard.
