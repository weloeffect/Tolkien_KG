The '''last prince of Cardolan''' was a noble during the [[Fall of Cardolan|demise]] of [[Cardolan]].

==History==
The last prince of Cardolan died in a [[Angmar conflict|war]] in {{TA|1409}} when a great army from [[Angmar]] attacked Cardolan.<ref name="Mounds">{{App|Eriador}}, entry about the mounds of Tyrn Gorthad, p. 1041</ref>

It is possible that he was a vassal ruler of Cardolan that only had the title "prince". Almost 500 years before his death, the Kingdom of [[Arnor]] had been divided after the death of King [[Eärendur (King of Arnor)|Eärendur]] in {{TA|861}} into the realms of [[Arthedain]], [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]], because of disagreements among the sons of Eärendur.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, p. 1039</ref> Not long before the death of the last prince of Cardolan,<ref>{{App|North}}, ''Arthedain'', Malvegil, p. 1038</ref><ref>{{App|North}}, ''Arthedain'', Argeleb I, p. 1038</ref> King [[Argeleb I]] of Arthedain claimed to be the King of all of Arnor, and thus to also be the King of Cardolan, because there were no remaining [[Heir of Isildur|descendants]] of [[Isildur]] in Cardolan and Rhudaur.<ref>{{App|Eriador}}, entry about king Argeleb I, p. 1040</ref> It is possible that Cardolan had accepted this claim and that the ruler of Cardolan became a vassal ruler with the title "prince". In any case, it appears that Cardolan was not actively opposing Arthedain, but rather assisting it in the fight against Angmar and the now corrupted Rhudaur.<ref group="note">In the entry for the year 1356 of manuscript T4 of {{PM|Third}} king Argeleb I is slain in battle with Cardolan and Rhudaur and both realms resist his claim to overlordship, but the entry about king Argeleb I in {{App|Eriador}} only mentions that his claim was resisted by Rhudaur and that he was slain in battle with Rhudaur and Angmar without mentioning that Cardolan resisted the claim or that he died in battle with Cardolan. In addition Cardolan later helped Arthedain in the wars with Rhudaur and Angmar during the rule of Arveleg I. Furthermore, a prince of Cardolan, rather than a king of Cardolan is mentioned later.</ref>

The last prince of Cardolan was buried in a mound in the [[Barrow-downs]].<ref name="Mounds" />

In that tomb was a pile of treasures, including a blue-jewelled brooch belonging to a "fair" woman that [[Tom Bombadil]] seemingly knew long ago.<ref>{{FR|Barrow}}, p. 145</ref> Whether that lady was related to the last prince, no tale tells.

==Legacy==
The [[Witch-king]] of Angmar rose and empowered the [[Barrow-wights]] of Cardolan<ref>{{HM|RC}}, "Fog on the Barrow-downs", p. 145-6</ref> and slew the [[Rangers of the North]] in order to trap the [[Ring]]-bearer.<ref>{{UT|Hunt}}</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, "Flight to the Ford", p. 180</ref> Indeed, on [[28 September]] {{TA|3018|n}}<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3018, September 28, p. 1091</ref>, [[Frodo Baggins]] and his comrades were trapped in the Barrow-downs by a [[Barrow-wight]] in a mound,<ref>{{FR|Barrow}}, pp. 139-42</ref> which some say was the grave of the last prince of Cardolan<ref name="Mounds" /><ref name="RC">{{HM|RC}}, "Fog on the Barrow-downs", pp. 144-5</ref>.

While [[Merry]] was trapped in the mound, he dreamed that he and others were attacked and defeated by "the men of [[Carn Dûm]]" at night and that his heart had been pierced with a spear<ref>{{FR|Barrow}}, p. 143</ref>, which probably was a memory of the last moments of the prince<ref name="RC" />.

==Other versions of the legendarium== 
In the earlier versions of the story, the barrow where the Hobbits were trapped was said to belong to a prince of the men that "fought against the evil foes" long ago, and was slain during the war. The identification of the buried prince with the last prince of Cardolan, as well as the appearance of Angmar and the men of Carn Dûm, are subsequent.<ref>{{RS|Wight}}, p. 127-8</ref><ref>{{TI|Bree}}, p. 37</ref> 

Also, in the earlier versions Tom Bombadil's statement regarding the blue-jewelled brooch he took for Goldberry, and the mysterious lady that once wore it, was almost identical to the published version, except that he also mentioned that "they shall not forget" the kings, the warriors and the fair maidens of the past.<ref>{{RS|Wight}}, p. 128</ref>

'''2022: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The Last Prince of Cardolan is named Ostir, son of Ostecthel. Like his father and grandfather before him, he ruled in fealty to [[Argeleb I]] after the direct line of Isildur in Cardolan had died out. He fought bravely in the [[Fall of Amon Sûl]], only to return to find his home razed in his absence. His men fell into an ambush, and Ostir was the last to fall in battle. His mother, princess-regent Luilloth went to [[Tom Bombadil]] and Lady [[Goldberry]] to plead for aid against the evil raised by the [[Witch-king]] in the [[Barrow-downs]]. Though she did not come back, the evil had subsided for a time; the blue-jewelled brooch belonged to her.
