'''Hugo Victor Dyson Dyson''' was a fellow [[Inklings|Inkling]] with [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]. He helped Tolkien persuade [[C.S. Lewis]] to (active) [[Christianity]].

He much preferred talk to readings at Inklings meetings and is remembered by [[Christopher Tolkien]] as "lying on the couch, and lolling and shouting and saying, 'Oh God, no more Elves'" during reading of ''The Lord of the Rings''.<ref>[[Christopher Tolkien]] in ''[[J.R.R.T.: A Film Portrait of J.R.R. Tolkien]]''</ref>
