'''Elendur''' ({{TA|552}}<ref>{{PM|Elendil}}, p. 193</ref> - {{TA|777}},<ref name="North">{{App|North}}</ref> died aged 225) was the ninth [[King of Arnor]].

==History==
Elendur's rule was uneventful. He ruled Arnor for 125 years, and was succeeded by his son, [[Eärendur (King of Arnor)|Eärendur]] - the last king of [[Arnor]], upon his death in 777.<ref name="North"/>

==Etymology==
''Elendur'' is a [[Quenya]] name. Its meaning is not glossed. [[Helge Fauskanger]] suggests it was probably intended to mean "Elf-servant", but literally means "Star-servant".<ref>{{webcite|author=Helge Fauskanger|articleurl=https://folk.uib.no/hnohf/quen-eng.htm|articlename='''Elendur'''|website=Quettaparma Quenyallo|accessed=27 January 2022}}</ref> The [[Edain]] found it difficult to determine whether words and names containing the element ''el'' referred to the stars or to the Elves.<ref>{{WJ|Author}}, Note 10, p. 410</ref> It is likely that he was named in memory of [[Isildur]]'s son, [[Elendur (son of Isildur)|Elendur]], who was killed in the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]]. The first element, ''[[elen]]'', was likely taken from the name of this earlier Elendur's grandfather, [[Elendil]], where it was intended to mean "Elf".<ref name=L297>{{L|297|118}}</ref> The second element, ''[[-ndur|-(n)dur]]'' was likely taken from this earlier Elendur's father, Isildur, where it means "servant" from the verb "to serve".<ref name=L297/>
