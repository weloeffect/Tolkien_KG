==Quotes==
{{quote|My whole body, literally head to toe was covered in prosthetics. The head came in 5 pieces, the body came in all different stages, my arms, and my chest was glued on, my legs, feet, fingers, and hands! Every-single-part of my body was completely covered!|Lawrence Makoare, [http://www.theonering.net/features/newsroom/files/011402_makoare.html theonering.net interview]}}
{{quote|(on losing a limb to Aragorn) "It was really weird, I thought they would use a blue sock or something to cover my arm, so they can use the blue screen effect, but they didn't. We were in the forest just like you see it, I was asking them if they want me to hold my arm behind my back and the WETA digital guys just said 'no it's ok, we'll take care of it later'.|Lawrence Makoare, [http://www.theonering.net/features/newsroom/files/011402_makoare.html theonering.net interview]}}
{{quote|You know how it is if you're running in a coat and you get hot? You can take the coat off. Not me. As soon as we were finished filming about four people would crowd round me sticking icepacks down my neck! They lasted about two minutes.|Lawrence Makoare.

{{Quote|Some people call [the witch-king's weapon] a Mace, some people call it a Morning Star. Either way, I ended up calling it damned heavy because it was daaaamned heavy.|Lawrence Makoare}}
