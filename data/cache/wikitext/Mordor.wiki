{{quote|In the land of Mordor where the shadows lie.|[[Ring Verse]]}}
'''Mordor''' was a land in the south-east of the [[Westlands]] east of [[Gondor]]. During most of the [[Second Age|Second]] and [[Third Age]]s it was ruled by [[Sauron]] and it was his dwelling and base from which he attempted to conquer [[Middle-earth]].

Mordor was surrounded by three enormous mountain ridges from the North, from the West and from the South, protecting it from an unexpected invasion by any of the [[Free peoples]].

Only a few times in history did the free peoples have anything to do with Mordor; the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men|Last Alliance]] broke into the land to fight Sauron, and millennia later [[Frodo Baggins]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]] infiltrated that land to destroy [[the One Ring]]. 

==Geography==
Mordor was protected from three sides by mountain ranges, arranged roughly rectangularly: the [[Ered Lithui]] in the north, and the [[Ephel Dúath]] in the west until they turned to the east, forming a southern range.<ref name="FRMap">{{FR|Map}}</ref> The [[Morgul Pass]] led from the [[Morgul Vale]] in [[Ithilien]], which was guarded by the city of [[Minas Morgul]] (earlier [[Minas Ithil]]) through the Ephel Dúath into Mordor; [[Cirith Ungol]], a higher more difficult pass was guarded by the giant spider [[Shelob]] and by the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]]. Another known fortress was [[Durthang]] in the northern Ephel Dúath.<ref name="RKMap">{{RK|Map}}</ref>

In the north-west corner of Mordor the deep valley of [[Udûn (valley)|Udûn]] was the only entrance for large armies, and that is where Sauron built the [[Black Gate]] of Mordor. In front of the Black Gate lay the [[Dagorlad]]. Sauron's main fortress [[Barad-dûr]] was at the foothills of [[Ered Lithui]]. To south-west of Barad-dûr lay the arid [[Plateau of Gorgoroth]] and the volcanic [[Mount Doom]] (also called [[Orodruin]]);<ref name="RKMap" /> to the east lay the plain of [[Lithlad]]. The land in the western parts of Mordor were largely infertile, producing only sparse [[Brambles of Mordor|brambles]].

The southern part of Mordor, [[Nurn]],<ref name="FRMap" /> was slighly more fertile, and moist enough to carry the inland [[sea of Núrnen]]. Nurn was made somewhat fertile because the ash blown from Mount Doom left its soil nutrient rich, thus allowing dry-land farming. Unfortunately, the inland sea of Núrn was salty, not freshwater.  

To the west of Mordor was the narrow land of Ithilien with the great river [[Anduin]], to the east [[Rhûn]], and to the south-east, [[Khand]].<ref name="FRMap" />

==History==
===Early history===
[[Melkor]] created Mount Doom in the long [[First Age]], and the name "Mordor" may have been given to the land before Sauron settled there because of its eruptions.<ref>{{PM|Last}}, p. 390 (note 14).</ref> Also in the First Age, the [[Drúedain]] migrated westward, and historians in Gondor believed that  they came through lands south of Mordor and, after turning northward into Ithilien, became the first Men to cross the Anduin.<ref>{{UT|12b}}, pp. 339-340.</ref>

The first being known to occupy the mountains of Mordor was Shelob, fleeing from the [[War of Wrath]] in [[Beleriand]] at the end of the First Age. She fed herself on [[Elves]] and [[Men]] living or passing nearby until these became scarce.<ref>{{TT|Lair}}</ref>

Sauron settled in Mordor around {{SA|1000}}. In the north-western corner of this land stood Mount Doom, in which [[the One Ring]] would be forged. Near Orodruin he built his stronghold [[Barad-dûr]]. After this time, Sauron was known as the [[Dark Lord|Dark Lord of Mordor]].

For two and a half thousand years, Sauron ruled Mordor uninterruptedly. It was from Mordor that he [[War of the Elves and Sauron|made war against]] the [[Elves of Eregion]] and came to dominate most of Eriador in a period known as the [[Dark Years]]. That was until he was repelled by the [[High Men]] of [[Númenor]]. Retreating to Mordor, Sauron then directed his power over the far south and east of Mordor conquering and dominating the savage tribes of the [[Easterlings]] and the [[Haradrim]].<ref>{{PM|Dwarves}}</ref><ref>{{UT|Amroth}}</ref> Almost a thousand years later, Sauron was captured by the Númenóreans and brought to their island kingdom, eventually causing its [[Númenor#Destruction|destruction]]. Sauron returned to Mordor as a spirit and resumed his rule.

===The Last Alliance and Third Age===
Sauron's rule was interrupted yet again when his efforts to overthrow the surviving Men and Elves failed, and they fought their way back to their foe's domain. After several months of siege in the [[Battle of Dagorlad]], forces of the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]] came into Mordor. Sauron was defeated in a final battle and the Dark Tower was leveled to the ground, but Mordor was not settled by Men because of the dreadful memory of Sauron, and Orodruin.<ref name="rings">{{S|Rings}}</ref> 

The [[Kings of Gondor]] built watchtowers and fortresses around Mordor, such as the mountain fortress of [[Durthang]], the [[Towers of the Teeth]] at the [[Morannon]], and the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]], in order to prevent Sauron's servants from returning to Mordor.<ref name="Tower">{{RK|Tower}}</ref>

However, Gondor had failed in the long run; during the [[Great Plague]], the population was so diminished that troops were recalled and the fortresses abandoned.<ref>{{App|South}}</ref><ref>{{App|TA}}, {{TA|1640}}</ref> Deprived of guard, Mordor began to fill with evil things again, and it is said the first shadow was the [[Lord of the Nazgûl]] ({{TA|1980}}) who summoned the other [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]], first appearing since the [[War of the Last Alliance]], to prepare the return of Sauron.<ref name="rings" /><ref name="ta" /> [[Minas Ithil]] was conquered by the Ringwraiths in {{TA|2002}}; other fortifications that were supposed to defend Gondor from the menace inside Mordor were captured and turned into a means of shielding Mordor. Sauron resided in [[Dol Guldur]], until the [[White Council]] [[Attack on Dol Guldur|attacked]] it in {{TA|2941}}, forcing Sauron to flee.

Meanwhile Mordor had been long prepared for him, and declaring himself openly he returned to Mordor in {{TA|2951}}, where he finished reconstructing his Dark Tower.<ref name="ta">{{App|TA}}</ref><ref>{{App|Stewards}}</ref> By that time Mordor was protected too well to be captured by any military might that was available to the Free Peoples; in the north of Mordor during the War of the Ring were the great garrisons and forges of war, while surrounding the bitter inland [[Sea of Núrnen]] to the south lay the vast fields tended for the provision of the armies by hordes of slaves brought in from lands to the east and south.

===War of the Ring===
During the War of the Ring, Sauron gathered all his forces to Mordor. After the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], a Host of the West went to the Black Gate. Sauron sent his army to destroy the Men of Gondor and Rohan, but then [[Frodo Baggins]] destroyed the One Ring and Mordor fell. The Dark Tower, the Black Gate and the Towers of Teeth collapsed to ruin. Mount Doom exploded. Both Sauron and his Ringwraiths were apparently destroyed.

After the ultimate defeat of Sauron, Mordor became mostly empty again as the [[Orcs]] inside it fled or were killed. Crippled by thousands of years of abuse and neglect, but capable of sustaining life, the land of Mordor was given to the defeated foes of Gondor as a consolation, as well as to the freed slaves of Nurn who were formerly forced to farm there to feed the armies of Mordor.

==Etymology==
'''''Mordor''''' is a [[Sindarin]] name. It means "Black Land". It is a compound of ''[[mor|MOR-]]'' ("black, dark") and ''[[dôr]]'' ("land").<ref>{{L|144}}, paragraph about the Black Speech</ref><ref>{{S|Elements}}, entries ''mor'', ''dôr''</ref>

Its name in [[Khuzdul]] was '''''Nargûn''''', which contains the element ''narg'' ("black").<ref>{{RS|4XXVN}}, note 39, p. 466</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Mordor Map.jpeg|thumb|Early map of Mordor produced by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] in the 1940s.]]
The first ever reference to Sauron's land is mentioned without a name, in the story of the Fall, written in the 1930s, as an inner land far from the sea, over the mountains. There [[Thû]] had a fortress, and "[[Amroth]]" assailed him.<ref>{{LR|P1II2}}</ref> The name Mordor, the Black Country, appears first time in the second version of that text, along with Elendil and Gil-galad (both of them mentioned first time).<ref>{{LR|P1II3}}</ref>

==Inspiration==
It is not uncommon for names in Tolkien's fiction to have relevant meanings in several languages, both those invented by Tolkien, and "real" ones, but this of course happens with any two languages.

*A proposed etymology is [[Old English]] ''morðor'', which means "mortal sin" and later "murder".
*''Mordor'' is also a name cited in some Nordic mythologies referring to a land where its citizens practice evil without knowing it, imposed on themselves by the society long created for that purpose.

Tolkien is reported to have identified Mordor with the volcano of [[Wikipedia:Stromboli|Stromboli]] off Sicily.<ref>[[Clyde S. Kilby]], [[Dick Plotz]] ([[1968]]), "Many Meetings with Tolkien: An Edited Transcript of Remarks at the December 1966 [[Mythopoeic Society|TSA Meeting]]", ''Niekas'' (Niekas Publications, New Hampshire, USA) (19): 39–40  Referred to at tolkienguide.com and by another publication of the Niekas editor. Referred to at [http://www.tolkienguide.com/modules/wordpress/?p=3 tolkienguide.com ] and by [http://efanzines.com/ERM/veh36.htm another publication of the Niekas editor].</ref> Graham Tayar, a classmate of Tolkien's at King Edwards School, claimed that Tolkien told him once "that the physical setting [of Mordor] derived directly from the trenches of World War One, the wasteland of shell-cratered battlefields where he had fought in 1916".<ref name=RC>{{HM|RC}}, "Mount Doom", p. 613</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''1980s: ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'':'''
:In ''[[The Atlas of Middle-earth]]'', [[Karen Wynn Fonstad]] assumed that the lands of Mordor, [[Khand]], and [[Rhûn]] lay where the inland [[Sea of Helcar]] had been, and that the [[Sea of Rhûn]] and [[Sea of Núrnen]] were its remnants. The atlas was however published before ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', where it turned out that the [[Sea of Rhûn]] existed already in the First Age, notwithstanding that Mordor, due to the creation of the volcanic [[Mount Doom]], could have been uplifted from the Sea of Helcar during this time.

'''2001-3: ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)]]'':'''
:The proximity of Mount Doom and Barad-dûr is at a distance that is non-canonical.{{citation needed}}

[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Mordor map.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Mordor in''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'' ]]
'''2017: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Mordor|Mordor]]'' expansion added the [[Plateau of Gorgoroth]] as a region dvided into five distinct areas: '''[[Udûn (valley)|Udûn]]''' where the massive forge-works of the enemy are located, the plain of '''Dor Amarth''' between [[Ered Lithui]] and [[Mount Doom]], the valley of '''Lhingris''' between [[Ephel Dúath]] and [[Morgai]], '''Talath Urui''' to the south of [[Orodruin]] where a lake of molten lava now spews and '''Agarnaith''', a swamp-infested area to the east of Mount Doom and to the south of [[Barad-dûr]].
:The ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Minas Morgul|Minas Morgul]]'' expansion added the [[Morgul Vale]] and an alternate version of Dor Amarth, chronologically set in [[Second Age 3440|S.A. 3440]].

'''2022: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power]]'':'''
:'''1 September: ''[[A Shadow of the Past]]'':'''
::Before the rise of [[Sauron]], the land of Mordor was known as the '''Southlands''' and the [[Plateau of Gorgoroth]] was inhabited by [[Men]] who called themselves [[Pre-Númenóreans|Southlanders]]. These Men had built countless settlements. Some of which were villages such as [[Tirharad]], [[Hordern]], and [[Iorbad]], while others were outposts such as the [[Watchtower of Ostirith]].
:'''7 October: ''[[The Eye]]'':'''
::[[Waldreg]], under the instruction of [[Adar (The Rings of Power)|Adar]], diverted water into [[Mount Doom|Orodruin]], causing it to erupt. After the region is destroyed by the eruption and its inhabitants fled, Adar states that the Southlands is the name of a place that no longer exists. A caption reveals its new name to be Mordor.
