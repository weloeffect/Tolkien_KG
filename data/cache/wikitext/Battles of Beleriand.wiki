{{quote|The [[Silmarils|Jewels]] were coveted by [[Morgoth]] the Enemy, who stole them and, after destroying the [[Two Trees|Trees]], took them to [[Middle-earth]], and guarded them in his great fortress of [[Thangorodrim]]. Against the will of the [[Valar]] [[Fëanor]] forsook the [[Blessed Realm]] and went in exile to Middle-earth, leading with him a great part of his people; for in his pride he purposed to recover the Jewels from Morgoth by force. Thereafter followed the hopeless war of the [[Eldar]] and the [[Edain]] against [[Thangorodrim]], in which they were at last utterly defeated.|''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Appendix A]], "The Númenorean Kings", "Númenor"}} 

The '''Wars of Beleriand''',<ref>{{S|Sindar}}</ref><ref>{{S|Return}}</ref><ref>{{S|Beleriand}}</ref> also known as the '''War of the [[Great Jewels]]'''<ref>{{App|Men}}, p. 1128</ref> or the '''War of the Jewels'''<ref>{{S|Akallabeth}}</ref><ref>{{UT|12c}}, note 7</ref><ref>{{MR|P5VII}}, Notes on motives in the Silmarillion (i)</ref> and referred to by [[Elrond]] as the '''Goblin-wars''',<ref>{{H|Rest}}</ref> were a series of great conflicts throughout the [[Elder Days]] pertaining of the vain attempts of the [[Noldor]] to reclaim the [[Silmarils]] from the Dark Lord [[Morgoth]]. 

From his mighty fortress of [[Angband]], Morgoth used this base from which to launch his attacks on the peoples of [[Beleriand]]. While the Noldor had some victories, the [[Doom of Mandos]] always hung over their efforts. 

==Major Battles==
The following are the major battles listed chronologically:

#The '''[[First Battle]]''' was fought before the [[Noldor]] arrived, and was fought by the [[Sindar]], [[Laiquendi]], and [[Dwarves of the Blue Mountains]].
#The '''[[Dagor-nuin-Giliath]]''', or ''Battle-under-Stars'', fought by the Noldor following [[Fëanor]] and his [[Sons of Fëanor|Seven Sons]].
#*Following this battle the [[Battle of the Lammoth]] was fought by the host of [[Fingolfin]].
#The '''[[Dagor Aglareb]]''', or ''Glorious Battle'', which led to the [[Siege of Angband]].
#*Various minor battles were fought during the Siege which are not counted among the majors, such as the first [[Assaults on Hithlum|Assault on Hithlum]], the [[Battle of the Gelion-Ascar Stockade]], and an attempt to [[First Age 402|breach the Pass of Aglon]]
#The '''[[Dagor Bragollach]]''', or ''Battle of Sudden Flame'', in which [[Ard-galen]] burned and many Noldor, including [[High King of the Noldor|King]] [[Fingolfin]], were slain.
#*[[Battle of the Pass of Aglon]], where the [[Sons of Fëanor]] had to retreat towards [[Himring]].
#*[[Massacre at Tarn Aeluin]], in which the [[House of Bëor]] was destroyed.
#The '''[[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]''' or ''Battle of Unnumbered Tears'', in which the [[Union of Maedhros]] was utterly broken by Morgoth.
#*[[Fall of the Falas]], in which the havens of [[Brithombar]] and [[Eglarest]] were sacked and fell, took place after the Nirnaeth.
#*[[Sack of Bar-en-Danwedh]], in which the [[Gaurwaith]] were destroyed and [[Dor-Cúarthol]] lost.
#*[[Battle of Tumhalad]], followed by the [[Sack of Nargothrond]], where the city was destroyed by [[Glaurung]] and his [[Orcs]].
#*[[Fall of Gondolin]], in which Morgoth's hosts besieged and destroyed the Noldor and their citadel of [[Gondolin]], killing King [[Turgon]].
#The '''[[War of Wrath]]''', which defeated Morgoth, ended the [[First Age]] of [[Arda]], and destroyed most of Beleriand.

**The [[Kinslaying at Alqualondë]] (the only conflict not happening in Beleriand)
**The [[Second Kinslaying]]
**The [[Third Kinslaying]]
*A brief conflict involving the Dwarves coveting the [[Nauglamir]]:

::During [[Galadriel|Galadriel's]] summarization of the [[First Age]], [[Finrod]] is seen fighting in the Wars of Beleriand against [[Orcs]] and other servants of [[Morgoth]]. During the war, Finrod shouted two [[Quenya]] phrases to his fellow [[Elves]]: "''Valaron kalanen''" ("By the [[Light of Valinor|light]] of the [[Valar]]!") and "''Firuvantë''" ("[[Orcs|They]] will die!"). Galadriel mentions that he vowed to destroy "''Morgoth's most devoted servant: [[Sauron|a cruel and cunning sorcerer]]''".
