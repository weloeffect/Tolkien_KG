'''Tobold "Old Toby" Hornblower''' was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] famous for introducing pipe-weed to the Shire.<ref name=Pipeweed>{{FR|Pipeweed}}, p. 8</ref><ref name=Road>{{TT|Road}}, p. 558</ref>

==History==
Tobold Hornblower came from [[Longbottom]] in the [[Southfarthing]] of [[the Shire]]. Around {{SR|1070}} ({{TA|2670}})<ref>{{App|TA}}, p. 1870</ref> he started to grow true pipe-weed in his gardens, the first recorded Hobbit to do so.<ref name=Pipeweed/><ref name=Road/> He was not much of a traveller, but in his youth he often visited [[Bree]]. He already had a keen interest in herbs and it is speculated that in one of these visits he learned of [[pipe-weed]] and of [[smoking]] from the [[Bree-hobbits]] (who claim to be the first smokers of that herb).<ref name=Pipeweed/> Toby however never revealed how he came by the weed. 

His name, "[[Old Toby]]", was given to a variety of weed that was still popular in the late Third Age.<ref name=Pipeweed/>

==Etymology==
Tobold is a form of ''[[Wikipedia:Theudebald|Theobald]]'' which contains ''theud'' "people" and ''bald'' "bold".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 31</ref> 

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In a draft version of the chapter "[[The Road to Isengard]]", the name of this hobbit was Elias Tobiasson of [[Mugworth]].<ref>{{WR|1|III}}, p. 36</ref> ''Elias Tobiasson'' is a common name in modern Swedish.<ref>{{WP|Elisa}} and {{WP|Tobiasson}}</ref>

In another early version of the [[legendarium]], Toby was named ''Tobias Hornblower'', and his [[Westron]] name was ''Zāra-tōbi''<ref name=Languages§50>{{PM|Languages}}, Personal names, §50</ref> ''Raspūta''.<ref>{{PM|Languages}}, On Translation, §42</ref>
