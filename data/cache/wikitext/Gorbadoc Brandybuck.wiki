'''Gorbadoc "Broadbelt" Brandybuck''' was a [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] of [[Buckland]], [[Master of Buckland]] and grandfather of [[Frodo Baggins]]. 

==History==
Gorbadoc was the son of [[Marmadoc Brandybuck]] and after his father's death in {{SR|1310}}, he became [[Master of Buckland]].

He married [[Mirabella Took]], and had in all seven children: [[Rorimac Brandybuck|Rorimac]], [[Amaranth Brandybuck|Amaranth]], [[Saradas Brandybuck|Saradas]], [[Dodinas Brandybuck|Dodinas]], [[Asphodel Brandybuck|Asphodel]], [[Dinodas Brandybuck|Dinodas]] and [[Primula Brandybuck|Primula]].<ref name=tree>{{App|Brandybuck}}</ref>

According to [[Hamfast Gamgee]], Gorbadoc was generous and his son-in-law [[Drogo Baggins]] enjoyed visiting [[Brandy Hall]] for his rich table,<ref name=party/> at least until Gorbadoc's death in {{SR|1363}}.<ref name=tree/> But according to Hamfast it was during one of his visits to him when he and his wife Primula were drowned in {{SR|1380}}.<ref name=party>{{FR|Party}}</ref> In reality Gorbadoc had been dead by then.

==Etymology==
The meaning of the name ''Gorbadoc'' is unknown. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] noted that the names of the Bucklanders had a vaguely [[Celtic]] style.<ref name="Translation">{{App|Translation}}, p. 1135</ref>

[[Jim Allan]] suggested that the [[Celtic]]-sounding name ''Gorbadoc'' is "a slight alteration of ''[[Wikipedia:Gorboduc|Gorboduc]]'' or ''Gorbodugu''", a fictional pre-Roman king of the Britons in [[Wikipedia:Geoffrey of Monmouth|Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Wikipedia:Historia Regum Britanniae|Historia Regum Britanniae]]''.<ref>{{HM|IE}}, "Giving of Names", p. 202</ref>

His name 'Broadbelt' derives from his generous table and waistline.<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, p. 171</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In earlier manuscript versions of the chapter ''[[An Unexpected Party]]'', the grandfather of Bingo Baggins who was later renamed Frodo Baggins was called ''Gorboduc Brandybuck'',<ref>{{RS|1Iiv}}, p. 37</ref><ref>{{RS|Return}}, p. 234</ref><ref>{{RS|3XIXc}}, pp. 317</ref> and a friend of Bilbo was called ''Gorboduc Grubb''<ref>{{RS|1Ii}}, p. 15</ref><ref>{{RS|1Iiii}}, p. 32</ref>.

Gobadoc Brandybuck was called ''Gorboduc Brandybuck'' in the first four versions of the family tree of the Brandybuck family and in the first three versions of the family tree of the Took family. In the fifth version of the Brandybuck familiy tree and in the fourth versions of the Took familiy tree his first name was changed to ''Gormanac'' and then to ''Gorbadoc''.<ref>{{PM|Trees}}, manuscript BR 1</ref><ref>{{PM|Trees}}, manuscript BR 5</ref><ref>{{PM|Trees}}, manuscript T 4</ref>.
