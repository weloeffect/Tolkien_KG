The '''Gondolindrim''' were the '''People of [[Gondolin]]''', a mixed population of [[Noldor]]in and [[Sindar]]in Elves under the rule of [[Turgon]].<ref name="Beleriand">{{S|Beleriand}}</ref><ref name="Tuor">{{UT|1}}</ref> While they take their name from the city of Gondolin where they later dwelt, the Gondolindrim were in origin the Elves of [[Nevrast]].<ref name="Noldor">{{S|Noldor}}</ref> [[Ulmo]] seemed to take a special interest in the Gondolindrim throughout their history. The Gondolindrim were keen in arts and constructions but also valiant fighters.

==History==
The first Elves to dwell in Nevrast were Sindar, who had been drawn in days of old to the coasts near [[Mount Taras]] by the comings of Ulmo and [[Ossë]]. At the time the Noldor returned to [[Middle-earth]], most of the Grey-elves of Nevrast still dwelt in the coastal region in the southwest. Turgon settled there with his own people, Noldor of the [[House of Fingolfin]], taking up lordship of Nevrast and building [[Vinyamar]]. The first mingling of Sindar and Noldor took place in Nevrast, and they became one people.<ref name=Beleriand/>

At Ulmo's urging and with his guidance Turgon, seeking a refuge from [[Morgoth]], found the hidden vale of [[Tumladen]] within the [[Encircling Mountains]]. After [[Dagor Aglareb]] Turgon brought many of the most skilled of the Elves of Nevrast to Tumladen, where they set about building Gondolin in secret. When the city was finished, the people of Nevrast (including one third of the Noldor of Fingolfin, and even more Sindar) abandoned Nevrast and came in secret, in small companies one-by-one, through [[Ered Wethrin]] to Gondolin.<ref name=Noldor/>

Because Gondolin was strictly separated from the rest of Beleriand by [[Ered Wethrin]] and it is unlikely that substantial numbers of other kindreds ever came to settle there. Only a few notable outsiders are known to have reached the hidden city: [[Huor]] and [[Húrin Thalion]] were the first [[Men]] to come to Gondolin and dwelt there for a year,<ref name=s18>{{S|18}}.</ref> [[Tuor]], son of Huor, made the city his home<ref name=Tuor/><ref name="S23">{{S|23}}</ref> and [[Maeglin]], son of [[Eöl|Eöl the Dark Elf]] and Turgon's sister [[Aredhel]], fled there with his mother from [[Nan Elmoth]].<ref name="S16">{{S|16}}.</ref>

To save the Elves, Turgon began to secretly send his people out westward across [[Belegaer]], to seek [[Valinor]] and ask the pardon and aid of the [[Valar]]. None of his mariners succeeded, but this was a wise course, as Turgon would learn later.<ref name=Fingolfin>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

As the Elves of [[Beleriand]] began to prepare for a counterstroke to the [[Dagor Bragollach]], Turgon secretly began his own preparations. In {{FA|472}},<ref>{{GA|217}}</ref> the [[Union of Maedhros]] attacked [[Angband]], and Turgon rode to war for the first time. Unknown and unbidden by his kin, he opened the leaguer of Gondolin and rode to their aid with an army of ten thousand. This was to be the disastrous battle that was to become known as the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]. The army of the Gondolindrim escaped from the Fifth Battle thanks to the men of the [[House of Hador]].<ref name=Nirnaeth>{{S|Nirnaeth}}</ref>

At the [[Fall of Gondolin]], Tuor and Idril gathered as many of the people as they could find, and escaped down their [[Idril's secret way|escape tunnel]]. In the plain they could run unnoticed because of the steam and smoke. It was a hard road through the mountains, and [[Glorfindel]] was killed battling a [[Balrog]] that lay in ambush. But at last the [[Exiles of Gondolin]] came to [[Nan-tathren]]. After resting there for some time they came down to the refuge at the [[Mouths of Sirion]], where they mourned the loss of the White City.<ref name=fall>{{S|Gondolin}}</ref>

==Culture==
The Gondolindrim were living under the ultimate law of secrecy and no visitor was ever allowed to leave the city.<ref name=s18/>

Gondolin society comprised of houses of nobles with heraldic devices<ref>{{UT|1}}, pp. 46-50</ref> such as the [[House of the Golden Flower]].<ref>{{SM|Q16}}, p. 141</ref>

The Gondolindrim observed the [[Gates of Summer]] as a celebration.<ref name=fall/>
==Etymology==
''Gondolindrim'' is a standard formation of ''Gondolin'' ([[Sindarin|S]]: "The Hidden Rock") and the Sindarin suffix ''[[rim|-rim]]'', denoting a people.<ref name="SApp">{{S|Appendix}}.</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
===The Book of Lost Tales===
In the earliest version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', the inhabitants of Gondolin were called '''''Gondothlim''''' in [[Gnomish]]<ref>{{LT2|Appendix}}, entry "Gondothlim"</ref> or '''''Ondolië''''' in [[Qenya]].<ref>{{PE|13}}, p. 102</ref> 

They were those [[Noldoli]] who escaped from [[Melko]]'s power after the [[Battle of Unnumbered Tears]].<ref name=Tale>{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|157}} When [[Tuor]] arrived to their city, they are described in great detail:

{{blockquote|Indeed the Gondothlim were not bent of back as some of their unhappy kin became, labouring without rest at delving had hammering for Melko, but small were they and slender and lithe. They were swift of foot and surpasing fair; sweet and sad were their mouths, and their eyes had ever a joy within quivering to tears; in in those times the Gnomes were exiles at heart, haunted with a desire for their ancient home that faded not.<ref name=Tale>{{LT2|III}}</ref>{{rp|159}}}}

Despite their melancholic heart, the Gondothlim became proud and confident of their works, so when Melko withdraw his spies, they thought it was because of the strength of their fortress. And when [[Idril]] warned some of them in secret, they laughed, saying that "Gondolin would stand as long as [[Taniquetil]] or the [[Mountains of Valinor]]".<ref name=Tale/>{{rp|170–1}} 

The Gondothlim are also described as being organised into a number of '''[[Twelve houses of the Gondothlim|twelve houses]]''', each one with a leader and different characteristics.<ref name=Tale/>{{rp|174}} During the fall of Gondolin, most of them were butchered, and when the exiles settled down in the [[mouths of Sirion]], they took the name of '''''[[Lothlim]]''''' ("People of the Flower"), as the name "Gondothlim" saddened their hearts.<ref name=Tale/>{{rp|196}}

===Later versions===
In the [[Noldorin]] phase of the Elvish language, the term was '''''Gondothrim''''' (containing the plural suffix ''-rim''), appearing in '''''Gondothrim'''bar'', another name for Gondolin.<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, entry "GOND"</ref>
