==Summary==
Mrs Gasch ([[Pauline Baynes]]) was illustrating ''[[The Adventures of Tom Bombadil]]'', and had been given both a typescript and a galley-proof of the poems. However, the former mentioned [[Tom Bombadil]] wearing a "peacock's feather" on his hat, and the latter had a "swan-wing feather". Tolkien told her that the peacock was a leftover from an old draft, and would have to go. Bombadil had a swan-feather at first, and later in the narrative a blue [[kingfishers|kingfisher]] feather. 

Next followed a short treatise about the etymology of "kingfisher", and its place as the rival of the [[swans]] as most prized property of a King; in this case Bombadil. Tolkien told her not to be bothered too much, as most detail is just a "private pleasure". Tolkien looked forward to Mrs. Gasch' interpretation.
