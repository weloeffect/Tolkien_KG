'''Howard Leslie Shore''' ([[18 October|October 18]], [[1946]]), is a prize-winning composer. He composed the soundtracks for [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] and [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]].

He also appeared in a cameo in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''. He is one of the drinking [[Rohirrim|Rohan soldiers]] during the drinking game which [[Legolas]] beat [[Gimli]] in.

In 2020, it was reported that Howard Shore was in talks with Amazon to compose the score for the television series, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power‎]]''.<ref>{{webcite|author=Mike Fleming Jr|articleurl=https://deadline.com/2021/09/the-lord-of-the-rings-composer-howard-shore-score-amazon-tv-series-middle-earth-jrr-tolkien-1234839274/|articlename=Oscar-Winning ‘The Lord Of The Rings’ Howard Shore In Talks To Compose Music For Amazon Studios’ Middle Earth-Set TV Series|dated=September 19, 2021|website=Deadline|accessed=September 20, 2021}}</ref> Eventually, he wrote and composed the main title theme for the series, while the rest of the score was composed by [[Bear McCreary]].<ref>{{webcite|author=|articleurl=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2022/08/18/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power-soundtrack-album-details/|articlename=‘The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power’ Soundtrack Album Details|dated=August 18, 2022|website=Film Music Reporter|accessed=October 10, 2022}}</ref>

==Musical style==
Although he is mostly associated with the films of David Cronenberg, for which he contributed very atmospheric scores, [[The Music of the Lord of the Rings Films (composition)|Howard's Tolkien oevure]] is characterized by supple melodicism, triadic harmony (though generally not stable in key) and stacked orchestration. Although there is still a strong atmospheric, textural aspect - Howard often writes sections from string ''divisi'', tone pyramids and aleatoric passages - the defining characteristic of the score is the ''leitmotif'': harmonic-melodic and rhyhtmic ideas, loosely associated with narrative elements, which are repeated and varied through the score. There are some 160 such themes running through Howard's scores. This style of scoring is inspired by [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]], which Howard makes an homage to at the end of [[The Return of the King (soundtrack)|''The Return of the King'']].
