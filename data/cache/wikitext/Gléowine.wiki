'''Gléowine''' was a [[Minstrels|minstrel]] of the [[Kings of Rohan|King's House]] of [[Rohan]] in the late [[Third Age]].

==History==
Gléowine composed an immortalising song about [[Théoden]] and his ancestors after the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. It was said that he never composed another song afterwards. Sadly, only the last stanza survived:<ref>{{RK|Partings}}</ref> 

<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
Out of doubt, out of dark, to the day's rising
he rode singing in the sun, sword unsheathing.
Hope he rekindled, and in hope he ended;
over death, over dread, over doom lifted
out of loss, out of life, unto long glory.
</poem>

'''2013: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Gléowine is first encountered being banished from [[Edoras]] at the command of [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]]. The player and Horn later find him drinking his sorrows in the town of [[Snowbourn]]. Gléowine agrees to accompany the player, and they find that the land has been ravaged by the devilry of [[Saruman]]. They return after [[Théoden]] had been healed by [[Gandalf]] and the King takes Gléowine at his side on the ride to the [[Fords of Isen]]. During the [[Battle of Helm's Deep]], Gléowine keeps away from the fighting and later composes a song about the last stand of Théoden's door-warden [[Háma]]. Gléowine again journeys by the King's side to [[Minas Tirith|Mundburg]] and sees the King's death at the hands of the [[Witch-king]] first-hand.
