The '''Awakening of Men''' was the stirring of the first [[Men]], in the far eastern land of [[Hildórien]], towards the end of the [[First Age]], when the [[Years of the Sun]] began. They were awakened by [[Ilúvatar]], when the first Sun rose in the West.<ref>{{S|12}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the early ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', the Men awoke thanks to the [[Elves|Elf]] [[Nuin]], who discovered them sleeping in an enclosed valley of the East called [[Murmenalda]], the Vale of Sleep.<ref>{{LT1|X}}</ref> Accidentally he stirred a sleeper, overcome with curiosity, and he woke the first pair of [[Men]], right before the first rising of the [[Sun]] from the [[West]]. Their names were [[Ermon]] and [[Elmir]]. Nuin also taught them [[Ilkorin|speech]], and thus was the '''Father of Speech'''.<ref>{{LT1|Xn}}</ref>

In the [[Round World version of the Silmarillion]] of c. [[1955]], the awakening of Men is proposed to be much earlier, sometime between the [[Awakening of the Elves]] and the [[Battle of the Powers]] ({{YT|1050}} - {{YT|1100}}).<ref>{{MR|Myths}}</ref> In a draft published in ''[[The Nature of Middle-earth]]'', the date is given as {{YT|1075}} (which is of course by no means final desision).<ref>{{NM|Awaking}}, p. 43</ref>
