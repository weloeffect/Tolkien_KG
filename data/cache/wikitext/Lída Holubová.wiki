'''Lída Holubová''' known also by her nickname '''Aegeri''' or '''Gnóme the Artist''' is a Czech artist and active member of the Tolkien community.

She resides in Prague and has a deep connection to Tolkien's world. She discovered Middle-earth through books from her local library as a child and was captivated by the depth and elaboration of Tolkien's work. She is a self-taught artist and was influenced by renowned illustrators like [[John Howe]] and [[Alan Lee]]. She collaborates and finds mutual inspiration with other Czech Tolkien artists, especially [[Matěj Čadil]] and [[Šárka Škorpíková]].<ref>[https://www.deviantart.com/mirachravaia/journal/Talks-with-Tolkien-artists-aegeri-744022046 Talks with Tolkien artists: aegeri by MirachRavaia], DeviantArt (13 May 2018)</ref>
