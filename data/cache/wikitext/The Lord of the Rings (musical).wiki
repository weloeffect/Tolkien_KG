'''The Lord of the Rings Musical''' has been the largest, and most expensive, effort to adapt [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' into a musical. It was first shown in Toronto but to mixed reviews. It closed early and re-opened in London with a new script although reviews were still far from perfect.

==Productions==
===Toronto===
The Toronto musical was three-and-a-half hours long, had 65 actors, and was located at the  Princess of Wales Theatre in Toronto, Canada. The show cost approximately $26.9 million and ran from [[23 March|March 23]]rd (press opening), 2006 to [[3 September|September 3]]rd, 2006, closing at a loss.

====Cast====
*[[Gandalf]] - Brent Carver
*[[Gollum]] - Michael Therriault
*[[Galadriel]] - Rebecca Jackson Mendoza

===London===
After the musical moved to London, the stage was rebuilt, the script rewritten, and shortened to three hours. Previews began at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane on [[9 May|May 9]]th, [[2007]]  and the premiere was on [[19 June|June 19]]th, 2007. The musical had the same creative team but had minor changes in the cast, with only 50 actors in this version. The reported total cost was approximately $49 million, making it one of the most expensive musicals outside of Las Vegas.

It ran for 12 weeks, from Tuesday [[25 July|25th July]] until Sunday [[15 October|15th October]] [[2023]].
