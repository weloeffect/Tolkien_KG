=== Volume II: Mines of Moria ===
====Book IX - Fortress of the Nazgul====

The band of elves known as the Hidden Guard has crossed the [[Anduin]] river into the region of [[Mirkwood]], with Mazog as their prisoner. As the elves of [[Lothlórien|Lothlorien]] set up numerous camps through Mirkwood, they plan their attack on the fortress of [[Dol Guldur]]. The Hidden Guard continues to take Mazog through the dangerous forest unseen and through the Scuttledells, where Issuriel and Mazog are seriously wounded by the giant queen spider who dwells in those parts. The elf Achardor becomes furious that his companion has been wounded and threatens Mazog's life if Issuriel falls. Issuriel speaks of a rare antidote that will cure the poison but later refuses to take it instead to let Mazog take it. Achardor is even more outraged with this action taken but just before Issuriel loses her life the dwarf Broin finds more of the rare herb and the quest to Dol Guldur can continue. The Hidden Guard soon arrives at the gates of Dol Guldur where the trade of Mazog for Bori takes place. But Gorothul and [[Nazgûl|Ringwraiths]] arrive at the scene and refuse to hand over Bori, Broin quickly saves the elves from been slain by Gorothul but the elf Achardor chooses to stand against the [[Nazgûl]] and is killed. Mazog is freed and returns with the enemy. The elves of Lothlorien soon strike the fortress of Dol Guldur and free Bori from his cell. The elves capture the outside walls of Dol Guldur now only the tower is left to take. The raid on Dol Guldur continues within the dark tower and at the end of a tremendous battle the orc Mazog is slain by the mithril axe Zigilburk.

====Epilogue - Of Elves and Dwarves====
The elves and dwarves finish the last deeds throughout southern [[Mirkwood]]. The axe Zigilburk is buried yet again where the dwarves found it, to never wield its power again. The Elves of Lothlorien also strike several additional blows against the dark fortress, scouting three key locations and capturing one. Additionally, Gorothul is challenged in another assault within his quarters in Sammath Gul, where he is finally defeated.
