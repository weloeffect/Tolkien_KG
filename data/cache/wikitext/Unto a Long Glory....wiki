== Lyrics ==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
The doom approaches the Dead awaken; 
For the hour is come for the oathbreakers 
At the stone of Erech they shall stand again 
Hear there horn in hills enchants 
Who shall call them 
From grey twilight 
Forgotten ones? 

Out of doubt, out of dark 
Hope rekindles, and hope in end 
Over death, over dread 
Over doom lifted 
Out of loss, out of life 
And out of doubt, out of dark 
Over death, over dread 
Out of loss, 
Unto a long glory... 

The heir of him to whom the oath they swore 
From the North he shall come 
And he shall pass the door 
To the Paths of the Dead 

Mourn not overmuch - mighty was the fallen 
And war now calls us! 

And hear there horn in hills ringing 
Who shall call them 
from grey twilight
</poem>
