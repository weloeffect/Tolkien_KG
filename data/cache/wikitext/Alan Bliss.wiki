'''Alan Joseph Bliss''' (1921-1985) was a former student of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].

Bliss studied under Tolkien from [[1946]] to [[1948]]. In [[1966]], while he was working on a piece on Finn and Hengest, Tolkien lent him his old lecture notes from the 1920s. The notes were still in disarray when Tolkien died, and in 1979, [[Christopher Tolkien]] handed them over to Bliss for publication.
