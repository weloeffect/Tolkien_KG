'''Amon Dîn''', sometimes just '''Dîn''', was the first and easternmost of the seven [[Warning beacons of Gondor|Beacon-hills]] of [[Gondor]], which ran west from [[Minas Tirith]].<ref>{{RK|Map}}</ref> Lying to the east of the [[Drúadan Forest]], it was the nearest of the beacon-hills to Minas Tirith.<ref name="UT">{{UT|Cirion}}</ref><ref name="RC">{{HM|RC}}, p. 510</ref>

==Description==
Amon Dîn was the first Beacon-hill west of Minas Tirith and perhaps the oldest. It was originally used as a fortified outpost of Minas Tirith. It kept watch over the passage into North [[Ithilien]] from [[Dagorlad]] and any attempt by enemies to cross the [[Anduin]] near [[Cair Andros]].<ref name="UT" /><ref name="RC" /> In the late [[Third Age]], the eastern side of Amon Dîn was covered with wide grey thickets.<ref>{{RK|V5}}</ref>

==History==
On the night of [[7 March]] {{TA|3019}},<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 509</ref> [[Gandalf]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], riding eastward on [[Shadowfax]], saw the beacons being lit to call for aid from Rohan.<ref>{{RK|MT}}, p. 747</ref>

==Etymology==
''Amon Dîn'' is [[Sindarin]], meaning "silent hill" (''[[amon]]'' "hill" + ''[[dîn]]'' "silent").<ref name="RC" /><ref name="VT42">{{VT|42a}}, p. 19</ref>, which may refer to its distinct rocky and barren appearance that stood out and isolated it from the heavily wooded hills of Drúadan Forest.

'''2003: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'':'''
:The beacon upon Amon Dîn is shown as the second one being lit after the beacon just above the city of Minas Tirith.

'''2015: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:The beacon on Amon Dîn lies somewhat north-east of the [[Drúadan Forest]]. By March 13 the orcs have established a blockade on the road beneath Amon Dîn, blocking the path of [[Théoden]]'s riders. They patrol the area around and have doused the beacon. Despite the Riders of Rohan already on their way, the player is asked to relight the beacon.
