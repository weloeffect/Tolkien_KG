==Synopsis==
With the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] ready to depart [[Rivendell]], [[Elrond]] re-iterates the [[Frodo|Ring-bearer's]] quest is for [[Mount Doom]] and that there is no obligation for those travelling with him to go further than they wish. He bids them blessings for their journey and [[Gandalf]] then tells [[Frodo]] they are ready to leave. The hobbit looks around somewhat nervously as he asks "[[Mordor]] Gandalf, is it left or right?" In response, the wizard tells him "Left". 

[[Aragorn]] shares a last long look with [[Arwen]] before he gives her a slight nod and smile and follows the rest of the [[Fellowship]] over the bridge out of Rivendell.
