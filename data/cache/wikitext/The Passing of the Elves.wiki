<poem>
[00:00]  Fanuilos heryn aglar
[00:10] Rîn athar annún-aearath,
[00:20] Calad ammen i reniar
[00:30] Mi ‘aladhremmin ennorath!
[00:40] A Elbereth Gilthoniel
[00:50] I chîn a thûl lin míriel
[01:00] Fanuilos le linnathon
[01:09] Ne ndor haer thar i aearon.
[01:20] A elin na gaim eglerib
[01:30] Ned în ben-anor trerennin
[01:39] Si silivrin ne pherth ‘waewib
[01:48] Cenim lyth thílyn thuiennin.
[01:58] A Elbereth Gilthoniel
[02:08] Men echenim sí derthiel
[02:17] Ne chaered hen nu ‘aladhath
[02:27] Ngilith or annún-aearath.
