{{Quote|Oromë is a mighty lord. If he is less strong than [[Tulkas]], he is more dreadful in anger.|''[[The Silmarillion]]'', "[[Valaquenta]]: Of the Valar"}}

'''Oromë''' was a [[Valar|Vala]] and one of the [[Aratar]],<ref name=vala>{{S|IIb}}</ref>  also known as the '''Huntsman of the Valar'''<ref>{{App|South}}, note 1 of p. 1039</ref> and the '''Great Rider'''.<ref name=Captivity>{{S|Captivity}}</ref> He is considered one of the more powerful of the Valar.<ref name=vala/>

==Attributes==
Oromë was a hunter of monsters and evil creatures, riding on his steed [[Nahar]], and blowing his great horn [[Valaróma]]. He loved [[horses]] and [[hounds]] as well as all trees and forests. In [[Yavanna]]'s woods in [[Valinor]], he trained his folk and beasts to hunt the evil creatures of Melkor.<ref name=vala/> He hunted all foul beasts of Morgoth, and when he blew his horn, all would know that the woods had been purged.<ref>{{S|Sindar}}</ref> Oromë was known for his terrible wrath, in contrast to [[Tulkas]], who laughed often.<ref name=vala/>

Oromë was the brother of [[Nessa]] and the husband of [[Vána]].<ref name=vala/>

==History==
[[File:Kip Rasmussen - Orome Hunts the Monsters of Morgoth.jpg|thumb|left|''Orome Hunts the Monsters of Morgoth'' by Kip Rasmussen]]
During the [[Years of the Trees]], after most of the Valar had withdrawn completely from Middle-earth and hidden themselves in [[Aman]], Oromë was the last who came to Valinor, and even then he still hunted in the forests of Middle-earth on occasion.<ref name=vala/> He visited [[Middle-earth]] during the [[Sleep of Yavanna]], hunting monsters and fell creatures and the shadows fled temporarily until he left.<ref name=s1>{{S|Days}}</ref>

Being a powerful huntsman, he was active in the struggles against [[Morgoth]], who feared Oromë in his anger. In efforts against Oromë, Melkor raised the [[Misty Mountains]] as an impediment to his riding,<ref name=Captivity/> and sowed fear among the [[Elves]] of a [[Hunter and Rider|dark Rider]] who, upon his wild horse, would devour Elves who wondered to far.

Oromë was the first among the Valar to find the Elves at [[Cuiviénen]]. When at length some dared to approach him, and asked his name, he answered: "Oromë". When they asked what it meant, he again answered: "Oromë. To me only is it given; for I am Oromë"; while Oromë had many glorious titles, he withheld them so that the Elves would not be afraid. When the Elves further asked the name of his horse, and if it bore any meaning, Oromë answered: "Nahar, and he is called from the sound of his voice, when he is eager to run”.<ref>{{WJ|AD1}}</ref>

It was Oromë who gave the Elves the name "[[Eldar]]". Seeking to ensure their safety, Oromë accompanied the Elves from Cuiviénen to [[Beleriand]]. 

After the destruction of the Two Trees of Valinor, Oromë led his host in pursuit of Morgoth and [[Ungoliant]]. However, they were thwarted by Ungoliant's unlight.<ref name=Darkening>{{S|Darkening}}</ref>

Because Oromë was the only Vala who travelled in Middle-earth during the [[Elder Days]], it was believed, even during the [[Third Age]] that the wild [[cows|oxen]] found near the [[Sea of Rhun]] descended from his [[Kine of Araw|Kine]].<ref>{{App|South}}, Stewards of Gondor, footnote after Vorondil the Hunter, p. 1039</ref>

==Legacy==
In the aftermath of the [[Dagor Bragollach]], [[Fingolfin]] rode to Angband alone to challenge Morgoth to single combat. Those who saw him thought Oromë himself had arrived; for a great madness of rage was upon him, so that his eyes shone like the eyes of the Valar.<ref name=Ruin>{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref>

During the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] in the [[Third Age]], King [[Théoden]] displayed a drive and ferocity comparable to that of Oromë.<ref>{{RK|Ride}}, p. 838</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Oromë'' is said to be derived from his [[Valarin]] name '''''Arōmēz'''''.<ref name=Quendi>{{WJ|AD1}}, p. 400</ref> 

His name is translated as "Horn-blowing" and "Sound of Horns".<ref>{{PE|21}}, pp. 82, 85</ref>

===Other names===
'''''Araw''''' was the [[Sindarin]] form of the name of the Oromë,<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 96</ref><ref>{{VT|39a}}, p. 10</ref> while its [[North Sindarin]] form was '''''Arum'''''.<ref name=Quendi /> 

'''''Tauron''''' was an epithet used by the [[Sindar]] for Oromë.<ref name=Index>{{S|Index}}</ref><ref name=PM/> In the ''[[Valaquenta]]'', ''Tauron'' is translated as "Lord of Forests".<ref name=Index/> Another translation is "The Forester".<ref name="Index"/><ref name=PM>{{PM|XI}}, p. 358 (note 21)</ref> The language, to which the name pertains, remains non-explicit in [[Tolkien]]'s texts:
#[[Quenya]] word? The root of the word could be ''[[taure]]'' ("great wood") plus the ending ''[[-on]]''. The name would thus have the sense "One of forests".<ref>Suggestion by [[User:Sage]]</ref>
#[[Sindarin]] word? This would be suggested by its usage among the Sindar and by the [[Noldorin]] form it replaced (see below).

'''''Béma''''' was the name used by the [[Northmen]] for Oromë. As the great huntsman and horseman of the Valar, he and his steed Nahar were known to the horse-loving people of [[Rohan]], who claimed that their great horses, the [[Mearas]], had ancestors brought out of [[Aman|the West]] by Béma himself.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref> 
The name ''Béma'' is also from the [[Rohanese|tongue of Rohan]] ([[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] was inspired by the [[Old English]] word ''[[Wiktionary:beme|béme]]'' "trumpet").<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 153</ref>

Tolkien used at least two earlier forms of the by-name ''Tauron'':
#''Tavros'' - the form ''Tauros'' replaced - used in such early texts as the ''[[Lay of Leithian]]''.<ref>{{HM|LB}}, ''passim''</ref> The name is [[Noldorin|Gnomish]], defined as "Chief wood fay 'the Blue Spirit of the Woods'".<ref>{{PE|11}}, p. 69</ref><ref>{{LT1|Appendix}}, p. 267</ref><ref group="note">The form ''Tavros'' cited here from the ''[[Parma Eldalamberon 11|Gnomish Lexicon]]'', is defined as a "proper name". The form ''tavros'' (with a minuscule ''t'') is defined as "forest, wooded land".</ref>
#''Tauros'' - the form ''Tauron'' replaced - is a [[Noldorin]] word defined in the ''[[The Etymologies|Etymologies]]'' as meaning "Forest-Dread" ([[Sundocarme|roots]] [[TAW|TÁWAR]] + [[GOS]]).<ref>{{LR|Etymologies}}, p. 391</ref>

In [[Eriol]]'s [[Old English]] translations, Oromë is referred to as ''Wáðfréa'' "Huntinglord", ''Huntena  fréa'' "Hunting  Lord and Lord of  Hunters" and ''Wealdafréa'' "Lord of Forests". The name ''Béaming'' is a translation of Q. ''Aldaron''.<ref>{{SM|QA1}}</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
In the earliest form of the legendarium Oromë was described as the son of [[Aulë]] and [[Yavanna]] whilst having the daughter [[Nielíqui]] with [[Vána]].<ref>{{LT1|Index}}, p. 288</ref> ([[Nessa]] was already his sister; see [[Valarindi]], Children of the Valar)
