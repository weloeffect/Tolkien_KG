'''Sagan om Ringen''' is a Swedish movie adaption of [[The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]. The movie primarily follows [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo's]] jouney from [[The Shire|the Shire]] to the Fellowship's departure from [[Rivendell]].<ref>Sveriges Television, Sagan om Ringen, 1971</ref> 

Notably, the film was produced due to the success of [[Bo Hansson]]'s [[Sagan om Ringen (album)|Sagan om Ringen]] or Music Inspired by Lord of the Rings. Hansson created the music for the film.

Scenes with actors were filmed in front of a blue screen and the actors were composited into hand-painted backgrounds, created by [[Peter Linblom]], for the final product.
