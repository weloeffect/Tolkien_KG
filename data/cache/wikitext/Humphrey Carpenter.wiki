'''Humphrey William Bouverie Carpenter''' ([[29 April]] [[1946]] – [[4 January]]  [[2005]]) was [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s authorised biographer.

Carpenter first encountered the works of Tolkien during his youth and developed a long-standing fascination with Middle-earth. In the mid-1970s, following Tolkien’s death, Carpenter was granted unprecedented access to Tolkien’s private papers, diaries, and family correspondence, becoming the authorised biographer of Tolkien with the approval of [[Christopher Tolkien]] and the [[Tolkien Estate]]. This close working relationship allowed Carpenter to produce ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien: A Biography]]'' (1977), still regarded as the principal life study of Tolkien.

During his research, Carpenter conducted extensive interviews with Tolkien’s family, friends, colleagues, and former students, many of whom had not previously spoken publicly about Tolkien’s life. His work provided the first comprehensive account of Tolkien’s early years, academic career, and creative development, and helped define the modern scholarly understanding of Tolkien’s personal and professional world.

Carpenter subsequently expanded his contributions to Tolkien studies with ''[[The Inklings (book)|The Inklings]]'' (1978), a collective biography that examined Tolkien’s literary circle in Oxford, offering further insights into Tolkien’s friendships and influences. In 1981 he edited ''[[The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien]]'', working closely with Christopher Tolkien to select, arrange, and contextualise Tolkien’s correspondence.

In his final years Carpenter suffered from Parkinson's disease and he died of heart failure at the age of 58, a day after the anniversary of Tolkien's birth. He is buried in [[Wolvercote Cemetery]].
