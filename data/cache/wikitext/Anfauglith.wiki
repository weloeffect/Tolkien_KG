'''Anfauglith''' was the charred desert to the north of [[Beleriand]], created by the fires of [[Thangorodrim]] during the [[Dagor Bragollach]] ("Battle of Sudden Flame") in {{FA|455}}. It was originally the green plain of [[Ard-galen]].<ref name="Fall">{{S|Fingolfin}}</ref> Anfauglith remained barren until after the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]], when one hill, the [[Haudh-en-Ndengin]] or "Hill of Slain", again was covered with long green grass.<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>

It was upon Anfauglith that [[Morgoth]] assembled his whole power in the [[War of Wrath]] yet they were conquered by the hosts of the West.<ref>{{S|Earendil}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Anfauglith'' means "By Gasping Dust" in [[Sindarin]],<ref name="Fall"/> from ''[[an]]-'' ("with, by") + ''[[faug]]'' ("thirsty, gasping"<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, ''faug''</ref>) + ''[[lith]]'' ("ash, sand, dust"<ref>{{S|Appendix}}, ''lith''</ref>).

Another name was '''''Dor-nu-Fauglith''''' translated as "Land under Choking Ash".<ref name="Fall" />
