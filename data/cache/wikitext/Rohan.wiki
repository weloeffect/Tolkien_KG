{{Quote|At the bottom [[Three Hunters|they]] came with a strange suddenness on the grass of Rohan. It swelled like a green sea up to the very foot of the [[Emyn Muil]].|''[[The Two Towers]]'', "[[The Riders of Rohan]]"}}
'''Rohan''' was a [[Men|Mannish]] kingdom on the northern borders of [[Gondor]]. It was the territory of the [[Rohirrim]], a people of herdsmen and farmers. Well-known for their [[horses]] and cavalry, they were Gondor's most important ally. 

==Description==
The borders of Rohan were the River [[Isen]] from its junction with the [[Adorn]] and then northwards to the outer walls of [[Isengard]] and the Adorn in the west; from the outer walls of Isengard eastwards and northwards along the eaves of [[Fangorn Forest]] to the [[Limlight]] in the north; the river [[Anduin]] and the west-cliff of the [[Emyn Muil]] hills down to the marshes of the mouths of the [[Entwash]] and beyond those marshes the [[Mering Stream|Mering stream]] that flowed from the Wood of Anwar to join the Entwash in the east and the [[White Mountains]] as far as the end of their northward arm in the south.<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, (iii) Cirion and Eorl, paragraph with the footnotes 45 and 46 and the following paragraph</ref><ref>{{RK|Map}}, red dotted line with the label "Border of Rohan"</ref>

The most significant feature of Rohan's geography was the river Entwash, which divided the country between [[Eastemnet]] and [[Westemnet]], itself divided as [[Eastfold]] and [[Westfold]]. Other lands were [[the Wold]], the [[Folde]], the line of downs to the north-west of the [[East Wall of Rohan]]<ref>{{TT|Riders}}</ref> and the [[Undeeps]].
[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Riders of Rohan.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''The Riders of Rohan'']]
The Rohirrim found abandoned Gondorian fortresses and refuges in the White Mountains, such as [[Dunharrow]], [[Orthanc]] and the [[Hornburg]] which they restored and used themselves. 

The capital of Rohan was the hill fort of [[Edoras]] which lay on the slopes of the [[White Mountains]]. Another large city was [[Aldburg]], the capital city of the Eastfold and original city of [[Eorl|Eorl the Young]]. Other cities must have existed but are not named.

===Climate and countryside===
The countryside of Rohan was described as a land of pastures and lush tall grassland. The lands of Rohan are frequently described as appearing like "seas of grass". Most of the Rohirrim dwelt in small villages or farms.

==Background==
In the 1200s of the [[Third Age]], the [[Kings of Gondor]] made close alliances with the [[Northmen]] of [[Rhovanion]], a people akin to the [[Edain#The Three Houses|Three Houses of the Edain]] (later the [[Dúnedain]]) from the [[First Age]]. In the 2000s, a remnant tribe of such Northmen that called itself the [[Éothéod]] moved from the valleys of [[Anduin]] to the north-west of [[Mirkwood]], clearing out what remained of the recently defeated Witch-kingdom of [[Angmar]], east of the [[Misty Mountains]].  

In the meantime, the Gondorian province of [[Calenardhon]] was deserted by the [[Great Plague]] and during the [[Watchful Peace]], local chieftains, such as [[Dunlendings]] gained control.<ref name="isen">{{UT|Isen}}</ref> During the time of [[Cirion]] the [[Stewards of Gondor|Steward of Gondor]], Calenardhon was overrun by the [[Balchoth]].
[[File:Ted Nasmith - The Oathtaking of Cirion and Eorl.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ted Nasmith]] - The Oathtaking of Cirion and Eorl]]
In {{TA|2509|n}}, Cirion sent summons to the Éothéod for aid in stopping a combined invasion of Men from the north-east of [[Middle-earth]], and [[Orcs]] from the Misty Mountains. [[Borondir]] reached [[Eorl the Young]], king of the Éothéod, who answered the summons, and arrived unexpectedly at a decisive [[battle of the Field of Celebrant]].

As a reward, Cirion invited Eorl on [[Amon Anwar]], over the [[tomb of Elendil]], and he swore mutual alliance and cooperation between the two peoples. The Steward also gave Eorl the deserted but fertile area of Calenardhon to take as their own and repopulate.

==History==
[[Eorl]] moved his people there driving out the [[Dunlendings]] who attempted to repopulate it without [[Gondor]]'s consent. Eorl also built the first city of Rohan, [[Aldburg]]. Eorl lost his life fighting the [[Easterlings]] in the [[The Wold|Wold]].<ref name="mark">{{App|Mark}}</ref> Migration was continued to the days of second king [[Brego]], who defended the borders against the Dunlendings and Easterlings and drove the remaining [[Orcs]] and [[Balchoth]] off the Wold. Brego also built the Golden Hall of [[Meduseld]], and made [[Edoras]] the capital of Rohan.

[[File:Jan Pospisil - Edoras.jpg|thumb|[[Jan Pospisil]] - ''Edoras'']]
King [[Aldor]] was the founder of a golden age in Rohan's history, during which he completed Rohan's conquest east of the [[Isen]] and the [[Rohirrim]] increased greatly in numbers, and even settled valleys of [[Ered Nimrais]] including [[Harrowdale]]. It was he who succeeded in driving all the remaining Dunlendings from his realm. Rohan continued to prosper during [[Goldwine]]'s rule; but as the guard of the borders lessened, the Dunlendings slowly began to return to northern [[Westfold]], settling the area around the (friendly to them) [[Ring of Isengard]] and the southern eaves of [[Fangorn Forest]].<ref name="isen" /> A powerful Dunlendish force had been established, and King [[Déor]] was forced to ride northward from Edoras, ultimately to defeat his enemies but he was unable to recapture the Ring of Isengard. The following years the Dunlendings harassed and mingled with the Rohirrim.

The first line of kings lasted for 249 years, until the ninth king [[Helm|Helm Hammerhand]]. In {{TA|2758}}, Rohan was invaded by Dunlendings under [[Wulf]], son of [[Freca]], of mixed Dunland and Rohan blood. The King, Helm Hammerhand, took refuge in the Hornburg until reinforcements from Gondor and Dunharrow (a refuge of the Rohirrim) arrived a year later and defeated the invaders. In a daring raid [[Fréaláf]] recaptured Edoras, and managed to reclaim it. He eventually drove the Dunlendings back across the rivers Isen and [[Adorn]], freeing all of Rohan. It would take Rohan close to 200 years to recover its strength after the invasion. 

The Rohirrim now kept a strong force in north Westfold, however at some time King [[Folcwine]] would need the help of Gondor to drive some of them from the area.<ref name="mark" /> He was successful but the people who remained were largely of mixed blood, and not loyal to Edoras.<ref name="isen" />

Soon after this, [[Saruman]] arrived and took over Isengard. He was welcomed as a strong ally. 

As Rohan was still recovering from the war with the Dunlendings, hostilities remained at the western borders. For two generations during the [[War of Dwarves and Orcs]], many thousands of [[Orcs]] sought refuge in the [[White Mountains]] and troubled the Rohirrim. King [[Brytta]] fought them off, and when he died it was believed Rohan was free of Orcs, but they were not entirely driven from the White Mountains until {{TA|2864}} by [[Folca]].

During [[Thengel]]'s reign, a mysterious Northerner calling himself [[Thorongil]] entered his service, and rode with him for some time. 

Around {{TA|2960|n}}, Saruman began harassing Rohan. In {{TA|3014|n}}, he began using his influence to weaken King [[Théoden]], and in {{TA|3019|n}}, he launched a full-scale invasion. Théoden's son, [[Théodred]] was killed during the [[First Battle of the Fords of Isen]], and during the [[Second Battle of the Fords of Isen|Second]], Saruman's forces crossed the Isen and scattered the Rohirric forces. Some regrouped with Théoden at the [[Hornburg]], where they were besieged. With help from the [[Huorns]], Saruman's forces were defeated at the [[Battle of the Hornburg]]. 

[[File:Ted Nasmith - Pursuit in Rohan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ted Nasmith]] - ''Pursuit in Rohan'']]
On the heels of this victory, Théoden rode with an army to [[Minas Tirith]] and helped break its siege in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], where he was slain. [[Éomer]], his nephew, succeeded to the throne, beginning the third line. Éomer rode with the armies of Gondor to the [[Gate of Mordor|gates of Mordor]] and took part in the [[Battle of the Morannon|final battle]] with the forces of [[Sauron]], who was defeated when the [[The One Ring|Ruling Ring]] was destroyed.

The rule of the Stewards of Gondor was now over. King Éomer and the new king of Gondor, [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]], renewed their oath of alliance, and reaffirmed Cirion's grant of Calenardhon to the Rohirrim. Though Sauron had perished, Éomer often fulfilled the [[Oath of Eorl]] and went with [[Aragorn|King Elessar]] far into the East and South. He was known as Éomer Éadig, or "the Blessed", because during his reign Rohan recovered from the hurts of the War and became a rich and fruitful land again.

After the downfall of Sauron, [[Gimli]] led a party of the [[Dwarves]] of [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] to Aglarond, the [[Glittering Caves]] of the [[White Mountains]] within the realm of Rohan, to which there was an entrance in [[Helm's Deep]].<ref>{{App|Durin}}</ref>

==Politics== 
===Military===
[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Two Towers - Rohirrim.jpg|thumb|Rohirrim from ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'']]
The military of the [[Rohirrim]] was commanded by Marshals. The [[First Marshal of the Riddermark]] was the highest military rank and commanded the [[Muster of Edoras]]: riders of the capital [[Edoras]] and the surrounding lands, including the [[King's Lands]] and [[Harrowdale]]. In his youth, King [[Théoden]] had led the Riders of the Muster of Edoras himself, so that no First Marshal was needed and at the time of the [[War of the Ring]], there was no First Marshal. 

The Second and Third Marshals had no fixed duties, and their roles changed according to the needs of the time. The [[Second Marshal of the Riddermark]] and was based in Helm's Deep and around the War of the Ring it was filled by Théoden's son, Prince Théodred, and later [[Erkenbrand]] after the death of the prince. The [[Third Marshal of the Riddermark]] was based at [[Aldburg]] in the [[Folde]] and around the War of the Ring it was filled by [[Éomer]].

After the War of the Ring, the new rank of [[Marshal of the East-mark]] was created for eastern Rohan by King Éomer. The first Rider to hold it was his lieutenant, [[Elfhelm]].

The Riders were divided into one hundred [[Éored]]s. in the days of King [[Folcwine]], a "full Éored" was defined as 120 horsemen (including its captain).<ref>{{UT|Cirion}}, note 36</ref> This would imply that a full muster of the Riders of the Rohirrim would number at least twelve thousand, if not many more. This does not include levied infantry, such as those [[Erkenbrand]] led at the [[Battle of the Hornburg]].<ref name="TT|Deep">{{TT|Deep}}</ref>

===Alliance with Gondor===
The alliance between Rohan and [[Gondor]] came into existence in the year {{TA|2510|n}} of the [[Third Age]]. In that year, the Easterlings launched a massive invasion of Gondor. The army of Gondor was defeated and trapped between the [[Limlight]] and the [[Celebrant]]. Gondor, which had always been on friendly terms with the different tribes of the [[Northmen]], sent messengers to the closest tribe, the [[Éothéod]]. Although it was unlikely that the message calling for aid would come through, it did. Then [[Eorl the Young]] and his fierce Éothéod Riders unexpectedly took the field during the Battle of Celebrant and turned the tide in the favour of Gondor. As a reward, [[Cirion]], the [[Steward of Gondor]], gave Eorl the depopulated province of [[Calenardhon]] for his people to settle, while fulfilling Gondor's need for a strong ally. The [[Oath of Eorl]] was sworn by both Cirion and Eorl. Neither nation broke the alliance. Rohan went to great lengths to fulfil their part of the treaty including sacrificing two of its heirs when Gondor was under threat from the [[Haradrim]] in [[Third Age 2885|T.A. 2885]], when [[Fastred (son of Folcwine)|Fastred]] and [[Folcred]], the twin sons of King [[Folcwine]], were killed during the Battle of Crossings of [[Poros]]. King [[Théoden]] once again honoured the alliance in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]]. In the years after his rise to the throne, King [[Éomer]] would often assist [[King Elessar]] of Gondor in his wars against the foes of Gondor.<ref>{{App|A2i}}</ref>

===War with the Dunlendings===
To the west of Rohan lived the [[Dunlendings]], a native people who had been hostile against the [[Free peoples]] for a long time. The Dunlending [[Wulf]] (whose father [[Freca]] was killed by King [[Helm]]) invaded Rohan and usurped the throne. Pressed by the west and east, the Rohirrim took refuge in the [[White Mountains]]. The [[Long Winter]] came upon the combatants, which caused many losses from both sides. Prince [[Háma (son of Helm)|Háma]] was lost in a blizzard searching for food while Prince [[Haleth]] was slain on the doors of the [[Golden Hall]]. Helm had also died from the freezing temperatures in {{TA|2759}}. Wulf was soon defeated by [[Fréaláf]], who was [[Helm Hammerhand]]'s nephew and became the tenth King of Rohan.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref> 

Rohan recovered very slowly from the war and the Winter and [[Beren (Steward of Gondor)|Beren]] welcomed [[Saruman]] and allowed him to dwell in [[Isengard]] in {{TA|2759}} hoping that he would help the Rohirrim. The following years, after {{TA|2799|n}}, the [[Orcs]] who were defeated and fled from the [[Battle of Azanulbizar]] attempted to establish themselves in the White Mountains. As they crossed Rohan, they infested the dales and many years of fighting passed until they were eradicated.

During the War of the Ring, Saruman incited the Dunlendings against the Rohirrim and they fought alongside the [[Uruk-hai]] in the Battle of the Hornburg.<ref name="TT|Deep" />

==Etymology==

The name ''Rohan'' (coined by [[Hallas]]) is [[Gondor Sindarin]], meaning "Horse-country". ''Rohan'' is a debased form of the proper [[Sindarin]] name ''Rochand'' (or ''Rochan''), containing the elements ''[[Horses#Etymology|roch]]'' ("[[Horses|horse]]") and the toponymical ending ''[[-nd|-and]]''.<ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Nancy Smith]], ""[[Index questions]]"</ref><ref name="Cirion">{{UT|Cirion}}, "iii. Cirion and Eorl"</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, pp. 247-8</ref>

The native name of the country was '''[[Riddermark]]''', or simply '''the Mark,''' a term used by the Rohirrim to describe their homeland. ''Riddermark'' means "land of the knights", derived from the [[Old English]] compound ''Riddena-mearc,'' with ''ridda'' referring to a "knight of the king's trained cavalry" and the term ''mark'' meaning a borderland, serving as a defence of the inner lands of a realm.<ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] (eds), ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', citing from the entry Riddermakr in J.R.R. Tolkien's Index for the 1966a edition of ''The Lord of the Rings''p. 248</ref><ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[The Return of the King]]'', "[[The Lord of the Rings Index|Index: III. Persons, Places, and Things]]", entry Rohirrim, explanation in square brackets from J.R.R. Tolkien's Index for the second edition (1965) of ''The Lord of the Rings''</ref><ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], "[[Unfinished index|Unfinished index for ''The Lord of the Rings'']]", in [[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] (eds), ''[[The Lord of the Rings: A Reader's Companion]]'', entry ''Riddermark'', p. 248</ref><ref>[[J.R.R. Tolkien]], [[Christopher Tolkien]] (ed.), ''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', "[[Cirion and Eorl and the Friendship of Gondor and Rohan]]", "(iii) Cirion and Eorl", p. 306</ref>

In a draft of ''The Appendices'', Tolkien noted that ''Rohan'' "is of [[Noldorin]] origin, a translation of the native ''[[Lōgrad]]''", having the "strictly correct form [...] ''Rochann''."<ref>{{PM|II}}, p. 53</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
Conceptualized as the "Horse kings of Rohan" who allied with [[Mordor]] in early drafts of [[1939]], the [[Rohirrim]] took their final form in [[1942]] when the text of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' was about one-third completed.

==Inspiration==
Several aspects of Rohan's culture and history seem to be inspired by both Goths, Scandinavians and the medieval Anglo-Saxons. Just like the Germanic Ostrogoths, Rohirric culture was a mounted culture. It had separated from the [[Northmen]], moved south, and had settled in close proximity with a civilization. In the Goths' case it was the eastern part of the Roman Empire and in the case of the [[Rohirrim]], it was [[Gondor]].

The granting of the province of Calenardhon by Gondor to the Rohirrim resembles the grant of land to the Ostrogoths by the Roman Empire to protect it against invaders.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 697</ref> 

Especially the Hervarar saga, with its Mirkwood, Gothic horsemen and shield maidens, appears to have inspired Tolkien when creating the Rohirrim, although he exchanged the Gothic tongue with the Anglo-Saxon. The antipathy between the Rohirrim and the Dunlendings resembles the historical tension between the Anglo-Saxon settlers of Britain and the native Celts.

[[J.R.R. Tolkien]] might have been inspired by [[William Morris]]'s use of 'Mid-mark' in ''[[The House of the Wolfings]]'', a book which Tolkien owned and from which he took inspiration. Furthermore, the name of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia, which included Tolkien's hometown of [[Birmingham]] and his alma mater [[Oxford]], is a Latinism used by historians, as the native term was not recorded.  The West Saxons called their neighbors in Mercia the ''Mierce'', a derivation by i-mutation from ''Mearc'', which would certainly have been pronounced ''Mark.''  <ref>[[Wayne G. Hammond]] and [[Christina Scull]] (2006), ''[[The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide]]: Reader's Guide'', "Morris, William", p. 600</ref><ref>[[Tom Shippey]], [[The Road to Middle-earth]], chapter 4 A Cartographic Plot, The horses of the Mark, second edition 1992, p. 111</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
[[File:The Lord of the Rings Online - Rohan map with towns marked.jpg|thumb|250px|Map of Rohan towns in ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'']]
'''2012: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Rohan is split into two major halves, divided by the river [[Entwash]]. Eastern Rohan, including the [[Eastemnet]], the [[East Wall of Rohan|East Wall]], and [[Nen Hithoel]], was added in [[2012]] with the ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Riders of Rohan|Riders of Rohan]]'' expansion. A smaller update added the region "Wildermore" to the north of the Eastemnet, between the [[The Wold|Wold]] and [[Fangorn Forest]]. Western Rohan, including the [[Westemnet]], [[Eastfold]], [[Westfold]], and [[Helm's Deep]], was added in [[2013]] with ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online: Helm's Deep|Helm's Deep expansion]]''.

:In addition to those mentioned in Tolkien's works, in-game Rohan features many other landmarks and settlements. [[The Mark]] is further divided into "Ridings", each governed by a Reeve from the chief town, with the surrounding villages each led by a Thane. The Reeves answer to either [[Aldor]] [[Harding (rider of Rohan)|Harding]] of the Eastemnet or to King [[Théoden]] directly. At the center of each settlement is a grand mead hall, which serves as the seat of the local Thane or Reeve, the place for communal gatherings and the most defensible position in case of an attack.

:Outside the borders of Rohan proper, the large fortified town of "Stangard" on the northern shore of the river [[Limlight]] guards the approaches from the [[Brown Lands]]. During the [[War of the Ring]] almost all of Rohan's settlements come under attack by the enemy, with several towns completely razed and burned to the ground, while some smaller villages are completely abandoned when the inhabitants flee to nearby cities for protection.
