'''Nost-na-Lothion''', or the '''Birth of Flowers''', was a festival held in [[Gondolin]] according to the early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''.

It was celebrated during the early spring, with a "revelry of children". It was apparently held to celebrate the passing of winter, when the ice of the [[Encircling Mountains]] melted and [[Tumladin]] took the water and burst into flowers.<ref>{{LT2|III}}, pp. 171-172</ref>
