==Etymology==
The meaning of the name ''Saradas'' is unknown. [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] noted that the names of the Bucklanders had a vaguely [[Celtic]] style.<ref name="Translation">{{App|Translation}}, p. 1135</ref>

[[Jim Allan]] suggests that the name ''Saradas'' is a variation of the name ''[[Saradoc Brandybuck|Saradoc]]'' with an ''-as'' ending like in ''Marmadas'' and ''Merimas''.<ref>{{HM|IE}}, "Giving of Names", "The Celtic-sounding Names", p. 204</ref>
