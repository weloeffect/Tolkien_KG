'''Helm Hammerhand''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2691|n}} – {{TA|2759|n}}, aged 68 years) was the ninth [[King of Rohan]] and last King of the first line.<ref>{{App|Mark}}, ''First Line'', 9. Helm Hammerhand, p. 1068</ref>

==History==
Helm became King after the death of his father [[Gram]] in {{TA|2741}},<ref>{{App|Mark}}, ''First Line'', 8. Gram, p. 1068</ref> during a time of an increased threat from the [[Dunlendings]]. His grandfather [[Déor]] had already fought against [[Dunlendings]], who had seized the fortress of [[Isengard]], established settlements in the valleys of the mountains to its east and west and raided the herds of the [[Rohirrim]] in the [[Westfold]]. Since Déor did not have enough forces to storm or besiege Isengard, the Rohirrim were forced to maintain a strong troop of riders in the north of the Westfold to counter the threat of further raids from the Dunlendings.<ref>{{UT|11c}}</ref>

In {{TA|2754}}<ref>{{App|Eorl}}, "Four years later (2758)", p. 1066</ref> [[Freca]], a rich and powerful man with wide lands on both sides of the river [[Adorn]], who claimed to be descended from King [[Fréawine]] yet was said to have much [[Dunlendings|Dunlending]] blood, was called to a council by Helm. Freca rode to [[Edoras]] with a great force of men and asked Helm for the hand of his [[Helm's daughter|daughter]] for his son [[Wulf]]. When Helm insulted Freca to have grown fat, Freca in turn insulted Helm to be old and that he could fall on his knees if he refused the staff that Freca had offered with the proposed marriage. After the council Helm took Freca outside, sent everybody away and hit him with his fist so hard that Freca fell down stunned and died soon after that.<ref name="Helm">{{App|Eorl}}, entry for King Helm Hammerhand, pp. 1065-1067</ref> It is possible that he received his byname '''Hammerhand''' after hitting Freca with his fist, but the date and reason for receiving his byname are not recorded. 

The men of Freca left Edoras, but in {{TA|2758|n}} they returned with a great force of Dunlendings, reinforced by enemies of [[Gondor]] who had landed in the south. Under the leadership of Wulf they overran Rohan; Helm fought them at the [[Fords of Isen|Crossings of Isen]] but lost and withdrew into the [[Hornburg|Suthburg]] and there endured a long siege.<ref name="Helm" />

Helm held the fortress during the [[Long Winter]]. He blew his great war-horn, and broke through the Dunlending ranks, clad in white, stalking men like a [[snow-trolls|snow-troll]] slaying them with his bare hands. However, his sons [[Haleth (son of Helm)|Haleth]] and [[Háma (son of Helm)|Háma]] were slain and Helm grew gaunt because of grief and famine; still his horn would fill the Dunlendings with fear each time it was heard. During one of his night sorties Helm died, possibly from famine and cold; his body was discovered frozen in the snow still standing.<ref name="Helm" />

There was a belief that after his death his horn was sometimes still heard in the Deep and that his [[wraith]] haunted the enemies of Rohan and killed men with fear.<ref name="Helm" />

He was succeeded by his nephew [[Fréaláf|Fréaláf Hildeson]], the son of his sister [[Hild]]. Fréaláf defeated the Dunlendings and retook Isengard.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}, entry for King Fréaláf, pp. 1067-1068</ref>

==Etymology==
''Helm'' in [[Old English]] means "protection". The word is seen also in the names ''[[Elfhelm]]'' and ''[[Dernhelm]]''.

'''2002: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'':'''
:As part of the decorations of the [[Hornburg]], two statues were erected. One was destroyed beyond recognition, but the other was one of Helm, portrayed with a literal hammer as a weapon rather than being unarmed.

'''2012: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:A tapestry depicting Helm Hammerhand is found in the Mead Hall of [[Aldburg]] and can be acquired for use in player's houses.

'''2017: ''[[Middle-earth: Shadow of War]]'':'''
:Helm Hamerhand is featured in this game as one of the [[Nazgûl]]. He is voiced by Fred Tatasciore, and in deviation from the books, he was ambushed by a warlord who wanted his throne and had taken his daughter for a lover, Helm was shot at point blank range with arrows. As he lay dying at Edoras, [[Annatar]] and [[Celebrimbor]] visited the wounded king, giving him one of the [[Nine Rings|Nine Rings of Power]]. When he recovered, he attacked his would-be assassin, declaring that war had come upon his enemy's house.
:However, when Helm's daughter tried to stop her father's rage, Hammerhand accidentally struck her down, killing her (once again, depicted as wielding a war-hammer). Horrified, his grief turned to rage, and Helm proceeded to slaughter his rival and even his own captains who tried to stop him. He was thus transformed by the terrible incident and his Ring of Power into a [[Nazgûl]].
