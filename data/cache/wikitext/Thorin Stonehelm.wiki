'''Thorin III Stonehelm''' ([[Third Age]] 2866 – [[Fourth Age]]) was the son and heir of [[Dáin Ironfoot|Dáin II Ironfoot]] of [[Durin's folk]], who was king of the [[Dwarves of Erebor]] and the [[Iron Hills]] in  [[Rhovanion|Wilderland]].

==History==
During the [[Lord of the Iron Hills|Lordship]] of his father, Thorin was more than likely born in the [[Iron Hills]] to Dáin II Ironfoot. During his younger years he saw his people able to finally return to the Lonely Mountain after many years of further exile, and wandering. He himself became a prince with the rise of his father as [[King under the Mountain]], and over all the [[Longbeards]].

During the [[War of the Ring]] at the age of one hundred fifty-three, Thorin fought the [[Easterlings]] in the [[Battle of Dale]], and took refuge in Erebor after his father was killed at its gates, along with [[Brand]] [[King of Dale|king]] of [[Dale]]. Thorin then became [[King under the Mountain]].

When the news of Sauron's [[Battle of the Morannon|defeat in the South]] came to the ears of the enemy, they became dismayed and the Dwarves and Men came forth from the mountain and routed them driving them back of the river [[Carnen]], never troubling them again.<ref name="Chief">{{App|Chief}}</ref>  

Under Thorin's leadership Erebor and Dale were rebuilt along with Dale's new king [[Bard II]], son of Brand, and once again both their people prospered, and their realms became close allies with the [[Reunited Kingdom]] of [[Arnor]] and [[Gondor]] of King [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]].

During his rule [[Gimli]], son of [[Glóin]], led a number of Dwarves South to [[Aglarond]], where a new colony was settled. Also during his rule mining for ''[[mithril]]'' in [[Moria]] slowly began again, although Moria was not yet permanently settled.

Thorin III had a descendant who was held to be the reincarnation of [[Durin|Durin the Deathless]], and would rule as [[Durin VII]] the Last.<ref name="Making">{{PM|Aiv}}, p. 278-9</ref> 

==Etymology==
Thorin's name is one from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. It means "Bold".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>

The origins of the epithet "[[Stonehelm]]" are mysterious: [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] doesn't provide us with any account that would shed light on its meaning.

'''2001-2007: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game]]'':'''
:A Decipher card identifies one of the Dwarves at the Council of Elrond in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' as Thorin III.

'''2018: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Online]]'':'''
:Thorin III Stonehelm rules [[Erebor]] after the passing of his father [[Dáin Ironfoot]], and is central to various questlines and stories taking place in [[Mordor]], [[Eryn Lasgalen]] and the [[Dale]] lands, the [[Iron Hills]] and [[Ered Mithrin]]. "Stonehelm" was originally a derisive nickname used by those who disagreed with his decision to retreat and seal the gates of Erebor, but after proving his worthiness he adopts it as a symbol of steadfastness and strength.

:His son is named Durin, but it remains to be seen if this Durin will become King [[Durin VII]]. His younger brother is "Náin the Slakeless", Lord of the Iron Hills.

'''2023: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria]]'':'''
:Thorin is first mentioned by an Emissary from [[Erebor]], stating that Thorin objected Gimli's call to return to [[Moria]]. Thorin later appears congratulating Gimli and the player character, proclaiming the player character the new Lord of Moria.
