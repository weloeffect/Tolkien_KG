'''Cwén''' was the first wife of [[Eriol]], according to the early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''.<ref name="Cwe"/>

== History ==
Cwén married Eriol (then called ''Ottor'') after he settled on the island of [[wikipedia:Heligoland|Heligoland]] in the [[wikipedia:North Sea|North Sea]], in the [[Great Lands]].

Together, they had two sons called [[Hengest]] and [[Horsa]], named so in honour of their grandfather [[Eoh]] (since the names share a similar meaning).

Sometime after, while Hengest and Horsa were still children, Cwén died, prompting Eriol to abandon the Great Lands and seek for [[Tol Eressëa]].<ref name="Cwe"/><ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outlines '''10''' and '''12''', pp. 290-1</ref>

<nowiki>*</nowiki> The name of Hendwine's mother is not Naimi but ''[[Nelmir]]'' in the text on which the basis of his inclusion is founded upon - neither is her relation to [[Lindo]] and [[Vairë (wife of Lindo)|Vairë]] elaborated on.<ref>{{PE|15}}, "[[Names and Required Alterations]]", Appendix, ''Text X'', p. 17</ref>
