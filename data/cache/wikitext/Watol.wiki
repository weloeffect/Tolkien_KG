'''Watol''' or '''Watla''' was an [[wikipedia:Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] king, according to the early version of the [[legendarium]] associated with ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''.

He commissioned a [[Men|Man]] called [[Íring]], the son of an [[wikipedia:Irish people|Irish]] king [[Ír]], to build a road through his lands, which he completed in seven years. However, Watol's sons, the [[Wætlingas]], were angered by Íring's arrogance, and so they wagered that they could build an even better road in only three years.<ref>{{PE|15}}, "[[Early Runic Documents]]", ''ER1d: Fourth page'', p. 96</ref>

== Inspiration ==
The character of Watol is based upon the legendary King Weatla, whose sons, according to the English chronicler [[wikipedia:Florence of Worcester|Florence of Worcester]], built the [[wikipedia:Watling Street|Watling Street]] in the year [[wikipedia:1013|1013 AD]]; Florence of Worcester also said that the name ''Watling Street'' was afterwards applied to the [[wikipedia:Milky Way|Milky Way]].<ref>{{PE|15}}, "[[Early Runic Documents]]", ''Commentary on ER1'', p. 100</ref>
