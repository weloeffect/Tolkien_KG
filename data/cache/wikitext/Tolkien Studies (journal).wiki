{{Quote|What else can one say? The reviews are full, numerous, by respected hands, and informative. . . . another magisterial addition to the growing corpus of Tolkienian scholarship.|[[David Doughan]]<ref>''You Get What You Pay For'', a review of [[Tolkien Studies: Volume 4]] in ''[[Mallorn 45]]'', p. 8</ref>}}

'''''Tolkien Studies: An Annual Scholarly Review''''' is an annual journal of scholarship on [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and his works. Since the publication of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' in [[1937]], the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien have been admired throughout the world. With the publication in the 1950s of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', Tolkien's fantasy writing began to attract academic attention in both the classroom and the world of scholarship. Most recently, [[Peter Jackson]]'s three-part movie adaptation has added film-study scholars to those fascinated by Tolkien's work.

It presents the growing body of critical commentary and scholarship on both J. R. R. Tolkien’s voluminous fiction and his academic work in literary and linguistic fields. The founding editors — [[Douglas A. Anderson]], [[Michael D.C. Drout]], and [[Verlyn Flieger]] — and the members of the editorial board — [[David Bratman]], [[Carl F. Hostetter]], [[Tom Shippey]], [[Richard C. West]], and [[Marjorie Burns]] — are all distinguished Tolkien scholars.

Printed issues of recent years can be purchased via the official website, while all back issues (from 2004) are available for access and purchase in digital formats.
