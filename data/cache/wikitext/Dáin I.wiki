'''Dáin I''' was the King of [[Durin's folk]] in the [[Dwarves of the Grey Mountains|Grey Mountains]].<ref name="Durin">{{App|Durin}}, p. 1072</ref>

== History ==
Dáin was the son of King [[Náin II]], and he had a younger brother [[Borin]]. He had three children: [[Thrór]], [[Frór]], and [[Grór]].

Dáin flourished during the period when the [[House of Durin]] was seated in the [[Grey Mountains]]. He succeeded his father when the [[Dragons]] of the north had declared [[War of the Dwarves and Dragons|war against]] the [[Dwarves of the Grey Mountains]]. Dáin ruled his people for only four years, who were troubled by increasing attacks on his [[Dáin's Halls|halls]] until he met his premature end when both he and his second son, Frór, were killed by a great [[Cold-drakes|cold-drake]] at the gates of his hall. 

After his death, his sons Thrór and Grór led most of the [[Dwarves]] of Durin's folk east. Thrór, along with Borin his uncle, led [[Dwarves of Erebor|one group]] back to the [[Lonely Mountain]], while Grór founded [[Dwarves of the Iron Hills|his own realm]] in the [[Iron Hills]].<ref name="Durin"/>

== Etymology ==
{{Pronounce|Dain.mp3|Ardamir}}
''Dáinn'' is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. His name most likely means "Deadlike".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>
