'''The Departure of Boromir''' is the first chapter of the first book in ''[[The Two Towers]]''.

==Summary==
The camp having been attacked by [[Uruk-hai]] in ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', [[Aragorn]] found [[Boromir]] mortally wounded. Before Boromir died, he told Aragorn that the Orcs had carried off the other [[Hobbits]]. The remaining members of the party (Aragorn, [[Legolas]], and [[Gimli]]) searched through the bodies of dead Orcs and found many weapons, as well as the blades of [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]]. Because they did not have time to bury him or build a cairn, they put Boromir's body into one of the boats gifted to the fellowship in Lothlórien and pushed it off into the flow of the Anduin, while Legolas and Aragorn sang a beautiful [[Song of Boromir|lament]] for Boromir, taking the voices of three of the winds.

Aragorn told Gimli and Legolas that he thought [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] had gone alone to [[Mordor]] and that they themselves should follow the Orcs and not Frodo. So saying, these adventurers continued on their journey, travelling in search of their missing companions.
==Composition==
The chapter was probably written at the end of [[1941]] and the start of [[1942]].<ref>{{CG|CG}}, p. xxiv</ref>
