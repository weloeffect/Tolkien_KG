The '''Great Journey''', or the '''Great March''', was the migration the [[Elves]] underwent from their birthplace at [[Cuiviénen]] to the blessed realm of [[Aman]]. This epic journey was initiated by the [[Valar]] in order to bring the Elves closer to their protection and wisdom, and for the Valar themselves to enjoy the beauty of the Elves.

The journey resulted in multiple [[Sundering of the Elves|sunderings among the Elves]], dividing the initial three clans into various groups depending on if they completed the march ([[Amanyar]]: [[Vanyar]], [[Noldor]], [[Falmari]]), abandoned it part way ([[Úmanyar]]: [[Sindar]], [[Nandor]]), or never departed Cuiviénen to begin with ([[Avari]]).

==History==
===Background===
In the [[Days before days]], the [[Valar]] fought a [[First War|titanic struggle]] against the malevolent [[Melkor]] over the shape of [[Arda]]. Eventually, following Melkor's destruction of the [[Two Lamps]], the Valar retreated to [[Aman]] in the west, where they created the [[Two Trees]], and left Melkor as the dominant power over [[Middle-earth]]. From his northern fortress of [[Utumno]], Melkor laboured and the evil things he perverted walked abroad, haunting the woods with monsters and shapes of dread.<ref name="s3">{{S|3}}</ref> The Valar seldom came to Middle-earth, save only [[Yavanna]] and [[Oromë]], the latter of whom as a mighty hunter pursued to the death Melkor's monsters and fell creatures. But even as Oromë passed the servants of Melkor would gather again; and the lands were filled with shadows and deceit.<ref name="captivity">{{S|Days}}</ref>

After many ages in the [[Years of the Trees]], the [[Awakening of the Elves|Elves awoke]] in [[Cuiviénen]]. They were first found by Melkor, who was ever watchful, and his shadows and spirits waylaid them; further, as Melkor greatly hated and feared the riding of Oromë, he instilled into the Elves the fear of a dark Rider that would capture and devour any who strayed.<ref name="aa2">{{MR|P2e}}</ref>{{rp|§43}} When Oromë eventually chanced upon the Elves while hunting, the noblest of them recognized that he was no shape of darkness and were drawn towards him, but others were filled with dread at his coming, and hid themselves or fled and were lost. Oromë named the Elves ''"[[Eldar]]"'', meaning "people of the stars" in [[Primitive Quendian|their own tongue]].<ref name="s3" />

After tarrying awhile among them, Oromë returned to [[Valinor]] with tidings, and spoke of the shadows that troubled Cuiviénen. The [[Valar]] rejoiced at the coming of the Elves, but were in doubt and debated long on how to guard them from the shadow of Melkor. Oromë soon returned to abide with the Elves, but [[Manwë]] sat long in thought and, after taking council with [[Ilúvatar]], summoned the Valar to the [[Ring of Doom]] and declared that they would, at whatsoever cost, [[Battle of the Powers|once again wage war on Melkor]] to retake mastery of Arda and deliver the Elves from his shadow.<ref name="s3" />

[[File:Peter Xavier Price - Ingwe, Finwe and Elwe.jpg|thumb|right|''Ingwe, Finwe and Elwe'' by [[Peter Xavier Price]]]]
To protect the Elves, the Valar invited the them to reside in Aman. The Eldar, at first unwilling to hearken to the summons, sent Three Ambassadors on their behalf: [[Ingwë]], [[Finwë]], and [[Elwë]] from the [[Minyar]], [[Tatyar]], and [[Nelyar]] clans respectively. The Ambassadors journeyed to Aman and there were filled with awe by the glory and majesty of the Valar and the Trees. On their return to Cuiviénen the Elves held [[Debate of the Quendi|a great debate]] where the Ambassadors persuaded the most part of their peoples, but not all, to depart. Thus was the [[Sundering of the Elves#Eldar and Avari|First Sundering of the Elves]] with those who departed becoming known ever after as the ''Eldar'' and those who refused as the ''[[Avari]]'' ("Unwilling").<ref name="s3" />

===Preparations===
In preparation, the Eldar hoarded a great deal of food before they set out, and took light cultural tools.<ref name="economy" />{{rp|272}} Further, the Eldar knew some metallurgy and, owing to the teachings of Oromë, fashioned weapons to defend themselves from prowling evils.<ref name="economy" />{{rp|272}}

===General proceeding of the March===
[[File:Sundering_of_the_Elves.png|alt=The Great Journey of the Elves|center|thumb|950x950px|The Great Journey of the Elves]]
[[File:J.R.R. Tolkien - Ambarkanta Map IV.jpg|thumb|right|Map IV from [[Ambarkanta]], showing an early representation of the March of the Eldar]]
Following Oromë, the Eldar went forth in three hosts, one for each kindred. First came those of the Minyar (aka ''[[Vanyar]]''), led by Ingwë, who were the smallest host and most eager for the road. Following them were the Eldar of the Tatyar clan, the ''[[Noldor]]'',<ref name="clan">{{WJ|C}}</ref>{{rp|484}} led by Finwë. Last came the Nelyar (aka ''[[Lindar]]''), which was the largest and therefore had two lords, both Elwë and his younger brother [[Olwë]].<ref name="annals3">{{MR|P2g}}</ref>{{rp|§58}} During the March the Lindar were given the nickname ''[[Teleri]]'' ("those at the end of the line", "the hindmost") as they were the least eager to depart and often lagged far behind the Vanyar and Noldor;<ref name="clan" />{{rp|506}} Olwë's host was ever the hindmost.<ref name="annals3" />{{rp|§62}}

Progression on the March went very slowly, for the leagues were weary and pathless. The Eldar also did not desire to hasten as they were filled with wonder at all they saw, and by many lands and rivers they would fain abide. Not a few rather feared their journey's end than hoped for it.<ref name="annals3" />{{rp|§59}} Additionally, they had to provide food, clothing, and such en-route. It proceeded mainly between late spring to early autumn alternating between a period of marching, and then another of halting for resting and activities such as providing repairs, making clothes, and curing fur;<ref name="march">{{NM|P1vii}}</ref>{{rp|57}} they would also use these periods of halt to forge additional weapons if they could find metals.<ref name="economy" />{{rp|272}}

[[File:March_of_the_Quendi_Airyyn.jpg|center|thumb|950x950px|Infographic depicting the March of the Quendi, such as described by Tolkien in ''[[The Nature of Middle-earth]]'' (p.47, p.49-53). The picture shows the itinerary of the Quendi in Middle-earth (at the top) associated with a timeline (center) in valian years and in solar years from the Awakening, and the number of Eldar (bottom).]]

In the fragmentary survivals of the legends of the Great Journey there are mentions of several secessions from the march, either by accident (some small parties lost their way), deliberate abandonment of the journey through weariness and loss of hope,<ref name="silvan">{{NM|P3xvii}}</ref>{{rp|323}} or where during a prolonged sojourn some simply remained content and stayed behind.<ref name="economy">{{NM|P3v}}</ref>{{rp|272}} For the most part these secessions were made by groups of the Lindar.<ref name="silvan" />{{rp|323}}

===Cuiviénen to the Sea of Rhûn===
[[File:Mark_Fisher_-_Cuivienen.png|thumb|right|''Cuivienen'' by [[:Category:Maps by Mark Fisher|Mark Fisher]]]]
The Eldar began their long journey passing northward about the [[Sea of Helcar]] before they turned towards the west. Before them, effects of the War were visible, with great clouds hung black in the North, hiding the stars in that region. At this, not a few of the Eldar grew afraid and repented, and turned back, and are forgotten.<ref name="s3">{{S|3}}</ref>

At the end of the first [[löa]] (equivalent to a sun year) of travel, the Eldar covered a distance of approximately 450 miles and reached the shores of the [[Sea of Rhûn]]. At the time it was a very pleasant place, and many of the the Eldar were content and wished to beget children. The hosts resided there as their first settlement until the new generation of children were born and grew to an appropriate age for journeying of approximately ten [[olmendi]] (growth years).<ref name="march" />{{rp|57}} Here, the Teleri improved their boat-making, with their ships becoming larger and stronger.<ref name="last">{{PM|Last}}</ref>{{rp|note 29}}

===Sea of Rhûn to Atyamar===
[[File:Mat%C4%9Bj_%C4%8Cadil_-_Greenwood_the_Great.jpg|right|thumb|''Greenwood the Great'' by [[Matěj Čadil]]]]
Once the children were able to journey, the Eldar travelled another 200 miles within a löa and camped in the wide grasslands, full of grain and food, which preceded the [[Great Forest]]. They were taught by Oromë how to sow and reap grain, and spent several löar doing so.<ref name="march" />{{rp|58}}

After this prolonged halt, the Eldar resumed and marched another 200 miles to reach the Great Forest. While it looked lovely, it was found to contain some of Melkor's lurking evils. Some of the Eldar were lost and the rest, now afraid, retreated 50 miles back to the grasslands to await help from Oromë. He returned after several more löar and drove off the evils, encouraging the Eldar to resume.<ref name="march" />{{rp|58}}

The Vanyar and Noldor then followed Oromë through the Great Forest, and emerged from the southern end into the [[Anduin Vale]]. At this point the Teleri began to straggle as not all had reached the east side of the Great Forest by the time the Vanyar and Noldor had gone through, and none had followed Oromë through it.<ref name="march" />{{rp|58}}

[[File:Ralph_Damiani_-_Across_Middle-earth_-_Lorien.png|right|thumb|''Across Middle-earth - Lorien'' by [[Ralph Damiani]]]]
The Vanyar and Noldor were delighted with the Anduin Vale and, in spite of the urging and discontent of Ingwë and Finwë, would not proceed any further. Their general thought was that this location, between wood and water, and rich in flowers and food, was where they should dwell and be guarded by the Valar. They thus settled on the east bank of the [[Anduin]], in the region that would later become [[Lothlórien]], and established [[Atyamar]] ("second home"). The Eldar enjoyed their life there, with the presence of the [[Maiar]] driving off evil, and they went through two periods of begetting children.<ref name="march" />{{rp|58–9}}

Around the time of the second begetting the Teleri, who went around the Great Forest instead of through it, began to arrive and, also liking Atyamar as a new home, settled and begat children themselves. Oromë and the chieftains were disturbed by this as the hosts could not be made to move until the children were old enough to travel.<ref name="march" />{{rp|59}}

===Anduin and the Misty Mountains===
[[File:Gianna_Michele_Kaye_-_The_Great_River_Anduin.jpg|right|thumb|''The Great River Anduin'' by [[:Category:Images by Gianna Michele Kaye|Gianna Michele Kaye]]]]
Either by chance, machinations of [[Sauron]], and/or because Oromë withdrew protection in the hopes of making the Eldar less content with Atyamar, the winters became hard and weather worsened. Though the host was burdened with many young children, with the youngest being many olmendi from maturation, the chiefs regardless ordered an advance across the Anduin, set for the spring after next. Over the course of the following loä, the Teleri, who already had a love of water and boats, completed a great boat-building and were ready with rafts and boats.<ref name="march" />{{rp|59}}

In the winter before the crossing, many Teleri fought against it. The Anduin was the wider than any river they had yet seen,<ref name="s3" /> and it was wild and flooded with great snowstorms from the Hithaeglir ([[Misty Mountains]]) which lasted far into the spring.<ref name="march" />{{rp|59}} From among the host of Olwë a numerous group of Teleri, led by [[Lenwë]], forsook the westward march to remain at Atyamar, becoming known as the [[Nandor]].<ref name="march" />{{rp|59}} 

[[File:Darek_Zabrocki_-_Galloping_Boulders.jpg|right|thumb|''Galloping Boulders'' by [[Darek Zabrocki]]]]
The rest of the Eldar crossed though, and came to the feet of the Hithaeglir. These had been reared by Melkor to hinder the riding of Oromë, and were taller and more terrible than in later days, with sharp horns which seemed to pierce the realm of the stars.<ref name="s3" /> Here, differing tales emerge.

In one, legends speak of a sojourn of many years and long debates before the Vanyar and Noldor, after long exploration, began crossing by the pass under the shadow of the [[Caradhras|Red Mountain]],<ref name="silvan">{{NM|P3xvii}}</ref>{{rp|324}} guided by Oromë.<ref name="s3" /> With Oromë gone, the Teleri looked upon the shadowy heights and were afraid;<ref name="s3" /> and many of them abandoned the march and settled in the dense forests between the river and mountain.<ref name="silvan" />{{rp|324}}

In another, the Eldar found the Hithaeglir impassible, with some lost in the attempt. Eventually, over the course of four löar, they wandered south through woods into the plain of [[Calenardhon]]. The Vanyar and Noldor settled about the [[Isen]] and halted for a long period while the Teleri straggled in. They remained there for many years, going through two further rounds of begetting children. The Eldar waited until the youngest children were of age before setting out again, scheming to have no more until reaching Beleriand.<ref name="march" />{{rp|60}}

===Eriador and Beleriand===
[[File:Rob_Alexander_-_Blue_Mountain_Dwarf_Hold.jpg|right|thumb|''Blue Mountain Dwarf Hold'' by [[Rob Alexander]]]]
[[Eriador]] was crossed comparatively rapidly. In the span of four loär the Vanyar and the Noldor reached the [[Gwathló]] river; here they waited for the first of the lagging Teleri who upon arrival aided them to cross. Within another loä they progressed further to the [[Baranduin]] river, near the [[Blue Mountains]].<ref name="march" />{{rp|60}}

The Vanyar and Noldor came over the Blue Mountains and entered the land they would later name [[Beleriand]]. The foremost companies passed over the [[Vale of Sirion]] and came down to the shores of the [[Great Sea]] between [[Drengist]] and the [[Bay of Balar]]. When they beheld the sea though, a great fear come upon them, and many withdrew into the woods and highlands of Beleriand; at this, Oromë departed, and returned to Valinor to seek the counsel of Manwë.<ref name="s3" /> Many of the Noldor dwelt in the forests that were afterwards named [[Neldoreth]] and [[Region]].<ref name="t&m">{{S|4}}</ref>

[[File:Lída_Holubová_-_Nan_Elmoth.jpg|right|thumb|''Nan Elmoth'' by [[Lída Holubová]]]]
After several years, the host of the Teleri crossed over Eriador, coming at last to Beleriand, and dwelt in the eastward region between the Blue Mountains and the River Gelion. And they came unwillingly, being urged by Elwë their king; for he was eager to return to Valinor and wished not to be sundered from the Noldor or his great friendship with Finwë.<ref name="aa2" />{{rp|§64}} Elwë went often through the great woods to seek out Finwë, and during one such visit he came alone to the starlit wood of [[Nan Elmoth]]. There he heard the song of [[nightingales]] and the voice of [[Melian]], which filled his heart with wonder and desire. Forgetting all his people and all the purposes of his mind, he followed the birds deep into Nam Elmoth and was lost.<ref name="t&m" />

At some point the Eldar encountered the [[Petty-dwarves]], who had settled in Beleriand before the Elves came there,<ref name="dwarfname">{{WJ|AB}}</ref> dwelling furtively in small groups west of [[Sirion]].<ref name="dwarfnote">{{WJ|Author}}</ref>{{rp|note 7}} Relations were hostile as the Petty-dwarves at once attacked the Eldar in darkness and ambush<ref name="dwarfname" /> and the Elves, not recognizing them as [[Incarnates]], but instead thinking them to be some kind of cunning animal, hunted them in response.<ref name="dwarfnote" />

===Crossing the Great Sea===
[[File:The Sundering of the Elves.svg|thumb|A chart of the [[Sundering of the Elves]]]]
By the council of the Valar, [[Ulmo]] came to the shores of Middle-earth and spoke with the Eldar who waited there. Through his words and the music of [[Ulumúri|his horns]], their fear of the sea was turned instead to desire. Ulmo, with the aid of his servants, then uprooted [[Tol Eressëa|an island]] which was far from either shore and moved it to the Bay of Balar where it was anchored. The Vanyar and Noldor embarked upon that isle and were drawn over the sea, eventually arriving at Aman. During this voyage part of the island broke off, becoming the [[Isle of Balar]].<ref name="eldamar">{{S|5}}</ref>

As the Teleri were dwelling far from the sea in East Beleriand, they did not hear the summons of Ulmo until too late; and many were still searching for Elwë and unwilling to depart without him. On learning that the Vanyar and Noldor were gone though, the most part of the Teleri, in longing for their departed friends, pressed on to the shores of Beleriand and came to dwell near the [[mouths of Sirion]] and took Olwë to be their king. They remained there for a long time, and were befriended by [[Ossë]] and [[Uinen]], with Ossë instructing them in all manner of sea-lore and sea-music.<ref name="eldamar" />

After much time had passed, Finwë and the Noldor, grieved by their long sundering from the Teleri, besought Ulmo to bring them to Aman; Ulmo hearkened to these prayers and returned to Beleriand with the floating isle. While most of the Teleri proved willing to depart, some were persuaded by Ossë to remain voluntarily, and became known as the ''[[Falathrim]]''.<ref name="eldamar" /> Others, who wished to go, continued seeking for Elwë and were left behind when Ulmo and Olwë, after tarrying a full [[Valian Year]], departed; these then named themselves the ''[[Eglath]]'' ("the forsaken") and withdrew to the forests as the sea filled them with sorrow.<ref>{{GA|15}}</ref>

When the floating isle reached the [[Bay of Eldamar]], within sight of Aman, Ossë, who had been following, called to the people of Olwë. They knew his voice and begged Ulmo to stay their voyage. Ulmo, who understood the hearts of the Teleri and had spoken against the summons, granted this request and at his bidding Ossë rooted the island. Finwë was grieved that the Teleri came not, and yet more when he learned that Elwë was forsaken. The island, alone within the Bay of Eldamar, became known as [[Tol Eressëa]] (the Lonely Isle).<ref name="eldamar" />

===Aftermath and later migrations===
The Valar gave the Eldar a land and dwelling-place within Aman. In a deep valley east of the Two Trees, the Eldar raised a high green hill, [[Túna]], upon which they built their city [[Tirion]] where the Vanyar and the Noldor dwelt long in fellowship.<ref name="eldamar" />

Elwë eventually awoke from his long trance and came forth from Nam Elmoth with Melian. His people gathered about him in joy, and they were amazed; for fair and noble as he had been, now he appeared as it were a lord of the Maiar, his hair as grey silver, tallest of all the Children of Ilúvatar; and a high doom was before him.<ref name="eldamar" /> He and Melian would go on to establish the realm of [[Doriath]].

[[File:Alan_Lee_-_Swanhaven.jpg|right|thumb|''Swanhaven'' by [[Alan Lee]]]]
The Teleri under Olwë dwelt on Tol Eressëa for a long age, but they were torn between the love of music of the waves, and the desire to see again their kindred and look upon the splendour of Valinor. In the end, their desire of the light was stronger, and Ulmo sent Ossë who taught them ship-building and gifted many strong-winged swans. The swans drew the white ships of the Teleri over the windless sea and they at last came to Aman.<ref name="eldamar" /> Olwë, with the aid of Finwë and the Noldor, built the city [[Alqualondë]] on the coast.<ref name="annals3" />{{rp|§76}} These Elves became known as the ''[[Falmari]]'' ("wave-folk").

A further group of [[Elves of Mithrim|Elves eventually settled in Mithrim]], in the north-west of Beleriand. While surviving traces of their language indicated that they must have been mainly Teleri in origin, a tradition lingered that some were in fact Noldor who had failed to embark; evidently because they had explored too far away from the shore, or had struck up friendships with the Teleri who came up behind.<ref name="pe17">{{PE|17}}</ref>{{rp|134}}

Many of the Nandor remained at Atyamar for thousands of years, but others migrated, with some eventually going south down the Anduin and settling on the shores south of the [[White Mountains]] near what would later be [[Belfalas]]. One group, led by [[Denethor (king of the Laiquendi)|Denethor]], son of Lenwë, went along the coasts and eventually arrived in southeast Beleriand many years later;<ref name="foot7">{{NM|foot}}, VII The March of the Quendi</ref>{{rp|fn2}} they became known as the ''[[Laegrim]]'' ("Green-elves").

The Avari evidently continued to call themselves by derivations of the [[Primitive Quendian]] term ''"[[kwendī]]"'' ("the People"), but their use of the term excluded the Eldar as they regarded those who went away as deserters.<ref name="dwarfnote" />{{rp|note 9}}

When the Elves eventually met the greater [[Dwarves of the Blue Mountains]], they recognized them as Incarnates for their skill in craft and ability to learn the Elven speech. Though the Elves were initially in doubt of them, believing them to be related to [[Orcs]] and creatures of Morgoth, they found that though proud and unfriendly, they could be trusted to keep their treaties and did not molest those who left them in peace.<ref name="dwarfnote" /> The greater Dwarves initially held grievance against the Elves for their hunting and slaying of their lesser, and despised, kin, but these were set aside through treaties and consideration of the lack of declaration on the part of the Petty-dwarves.<ref name="dwarfname" />

===Other notable Elves===
Nōwë, the Elf later known as [[Círdan]] ("shipwright"), and kinsman of Elwë and Olwë, was present on the Great March. Even in Cuiviénen, he was ever foremost and most inventive and skilful among the Teleri in boat-making.<ref name="last" />{{rp|note 29}} After the departure of the Vanyar and Noldor to Aman, Nōwë turned his thoughts to the making of ships as he and the other Teleri became impatient during the long waiting for the return of the floating isle. Nonetheless, for love of his kin and allegiance, Nōwë was the leader of those who sought for Elwë. After the floating isle eventually returned, Nōwë did not reach the shores until nearly all of Olwë's following had departed. As the isle was still visible in the distance, he determined to sail his own almost complete ship out to follow it. He was stayed, however, by a message from the Valar warning him that his skill was not yet enough to build a ship capable of crossing the Great Sea, and that his work in Middle-earth would be of utmost worth. He further received a vision of the [[Vingilot]], and from that night onward had foresight touching all matters of importance beyond the measure of all other Elves upon Middle-earth.<ref name="last" />{{rp|477–479}}

Among those those who initially refused to pass the Hithaeglir was [[Eöl]], though he too, along with a few others of like mood and averse to concourse of people, did eventually come to Beleriand.<ref name="maeglin">{{WJ|Maeglin}}</ref>{{rp|§9}}

[[Elmo]], younger brother to Elwë and Olwë, and grandfather of [[Celeborn]], was born during the March.<ref name="generationals">{{NM|P1xvii}}</ref>{{rp|132}} He stayed in Middle-earth and was beloved of Elwë with whom he remained.<ref>{{UT|Galadriel}}</ref>{{rp|307}}

==Ratio of Elvish clans==
According to Noldorin historians, the proportions (out of 144) of Elves who never undertook the Great Journey (Avari); of those who started but didn't complete it ([[Úmanyar]]); and of those who did complete it ([[Amanyar]]) were as follows:<ref name="clan" />{{rp|504}}

|The Vanyar and Noldor are led to Eastern Beleriand, which is safe, in 1132/12. Over the next few years they migrate about 800 miles by drawing about Western Doriath. At about 1132/17 they reach the coast of Beleriand.

|The Teleri are eager for the [[Belegaer|Sea]] and push west to the [[Falas]] or [[Nevrast]]; the Vanyar and Noldor chiefly inhabit about [[Sirion]]. By this time all the Eldar are in Beleriand.

===Sequence of events===
In the published [[Silmarillion]], the Elves were invited to join the Valar in Aman after the [[Battle of the Powers]]. Even though Melkor had been captured, many evil things still lingered under the fortresses of [[Angband]] and Utumno, and others dispersed and fled into the dark and roamed in the waste, and Sauron had not been found.<ref name="s3" /> 

In later writings, Tolkien reconsidered this. Before the Awakening of the Elves, the Valar had avoided confronting Melkor as they feared that such a war would be ruinous, with Melkor possibly being able to so greatly damage Arda that the Children could not come or could not inhabit it.<ref>{{MR|P4q}}</ref>{{rp|487}} The war against Utumno was only undertaken by the Valar with reluctance, and without hope of real victory, but rather as a covering action or diversion, to enable them to get the Quendi out of his sphere of influence.<ref>{{MR|P5VI}}</ref>{{rp|521}} This "rescue of the Quendi" was therefore secret (as far as possible) and behind a screen of investment before the violent assault upon Utumno had begun.<ref>{{NM|P1vi}}</ref>{{rp|44–45}}

Rather than the Elves fashioning their own weapons, an earlier idea of Tolkien's was for them to be initially made by [[Aulë]] and sent as gifts by the hand of Oromë. These came in at least two batches, with one being for their defence against prowling evils while they still dwelt at Cuiviénen, and still more sent to aid them while undertaking the Great March.<ref name="unrest">{{MR|P3II6}}</ref>{{rp|§52a}}
