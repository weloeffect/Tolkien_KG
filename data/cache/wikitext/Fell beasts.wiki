"'''[[Fell beasts (vague term)|Fell beasts]]'''"<ref name="pelennor">{{RK|Battle}}</ref>, also called '''Nazgûl-birds'''<ref name="name">{{L|100}}</ref>, '''Black Wings'''<ref name="blackwing">{{TT|Gate}}</ref>, and "'''hell-hawks'''"<ref name="siege">{{RK|Siege}}</ref>, were huge pterodactylic flying creatures that served as steeds for the [[Nazgûl]].

== Description ==
Fell beasts were huge winged creatures with a beak and claws and were described as similar to carrion birds<ref name="blackwing" /> but much greater and more monstrous<ref name="harrowdale">{{RK|Muster}}</ref> than any kind of bird, including [[Eagles]].<ref name="siege"/> They were dark and appeared shadow-like even at night.<ref name="dark">{{FR|River}}</ref> Their body was plain and naked, lacking any quills or feathers. They had a long neck as well as vast pinions consisting of a web-like "hide between horned fingers". They possessed a "fell speed" which allowed them to fly faster than the wind.<ref name="deadmarshes">{{TT|Marshes}}</ref> Furthermore, fell beasts also gave off a stench. In battle they swooped upon prey with their feet to drop foes from the sky,<ref name="siege"/> crushed enemies under their sheer weight,<ref name="siege"/> and used their vast wings to blow foul gusts of wind.<ref name="pelennor" />

== History ==
While their origins are unspecified, it was believed that fell beasts were creatures "of an older world" that may have been survivors of earlier "geological eras".<ref name="letter211">{{L|211}}</ref> While most of their kind presumably fell in those eras,<ref name="letter211"/> some "outstayed their day" and lingered on, breeding within a hideous eyrie "in forgotten mountains" that were "cold beneath the [[Moon]]". The fell beasts dwindled over time until, eventually, all that remained was a single "untimely brood" with an instinct for [[:Category:Evil|evil]]. Sometime later, this brood was taken by the [[Dark Lord]], who "nursed it with fell meats" until they grew larger than every other winged creature.<ref name="pelennor" />

In the year {{TA|3018}} of the late [[Third Age]], the [[Nazgûl]] rode black [[horses]] in their pursuit of [[Frodo Baggins]]. These horses were killed when they and their riders were washed away by [[Elrond]]'s flood at the [[Ford of Bruinen]].<ref>{{FR|Flight}}</ref> However, the Nazgûl survived; over the next few months made their way unseen to [[Mordor]], where [[Sauron]] gave them fell beasts to serve as new steeds.<ref name="pelennor" />

When the [[Fellowship of the Ring]] had left [[Lothlórien]] and were camped on the western shore of the river [[Anduin]] near [[Sarn Gebir]], a winged creature tried to approach them at night. However, it vanished "into the gloom of the eastern shore" with "a harsh croaking scream" after [[Legolas]] shot it with an arrow.<ref name="dark"/>

On Thursday [[1 March]],<ref name="thursday">''[[The Chronology of The Lord of the Rings]]'', p. 60</ref> a Nazgûl was sent from Mordor to the [[Dead Marshes]]. As Frodo, [[Samwise Gamgee]], and [[Gollum]] traveled through the marshes, the Nazgûl passed overhead on a winged creature at midnight<ref name="thursday" /> at "the speed of the wrath of Sauron" back to Mordor.<ref name="deadmarshes" />

In the evening of Sunday [[4 March]],<ref name="date">''[[The Chronology of The Lord of the Rings]]'', p. 62</ref> Frodo, Sam, and Gollum witness another Nazgûl, possibly "on some swift errand from Barad-dûr", pass overhead on a winged creature. On Monday [[5 March]],<ref name="date" /> a third winged creature flew overhead towards Mordor "an hour after midnight" which Gollum claimed was a very bad omen.<ref name="deadmarshes" />

In the dawn of Tuesday<ref name="tuesday">''[[The Chronology of The Lord of the Rings]]'', p. 64</ref> [[6 March]], a winged creature flew over [[Edoras]] in [[Rohan]] and stooped just over [[Meduseld]]. They described it as being a darkness in the shape of a monstrous bird. After this, [[Gandalf]] told the [[Rohirrim]] to assemble at [[Dunharrow]] rather than outside Edoras to prevent any attack. Three days later in the evening of [[9 March]], [[Dúnhere]], the lord of [[Harrowdale]], reported the incident to [[King of Rohan|King]] [[Théoden]], who had just returned from the [[Hornburg]].<ref name="harrowdale" />

When [[Faramir]], captain of [[Gondor]], was fleeing from the besieged city of [[Osgiliath]] on his way to [[Minas Tirith]], he and his men were beset many times by five winged creatures ridden by Nazgûl until Gandalf rode out and drove them away with a shaft of white light from his raised hand.<ref name="siege"/>

During the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]] rode his winged steed in battle against King Théoden; the Witch-king shot a dart which killed Théoden's [[Snowmane|horse]], who fell upon him, mortally wounding him. [[Éowyn]] removed her guise as Dernhelm and defended the dying Théoden, challenging and decapitating the winged creature. She then confronted and slew the Nazgûl, with the aid of [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]].<ref name="pelennor" />

== Etymology ==
As in the expression "fell things" occurring earlier in ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'',<ref>{{FR|I3}}</ref> the word ''[[Wiktionary:fell#Etymology 4|fell]]'' in this sense is an archaic English word meaning "dreadful, terrible".<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 110</ref>

The term "[[Fell beasts (vague term)|fell beasts]]" is not used solely for the winged steeds of the Nazgûl: it was also used as a descriptor for various evil creatures of [[Mirkwood]],<ref>{{FR|Breaking}}</ref> and also a descriptor of a type of creature hunted by [[Oromë]] in addition to monsters.<ref name=valar>{{S|IIb}}</ref>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==

== Inspiration ==
In a reply to a letter, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] wrote that he did not intend for the Nazgûl-bird<ref name="name" /> to be a [[Wikipedia:Pterosaur|pterodactyl]], though he acknowledged that it was "''pterodactylic''" and "owes much to" the "mythology of the 'Prehistoric'". He considered that its description left open the possibility for it to be "a last survivor of older geological eras".<ref name="letter211"/>

'''1978: ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]'':'''
:One of the Nazgûl (possibly the Witch-king, for he carries a mace) is shown riding on a winged creature. However, Bakshi's film only covers events up to the [[Battle of the Hornburg]], so that is the only appearance of a Nazgûl-bird<ref name="name" />.

'''1980: ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|The Return of the King]]'':'''
:The Nazgûl ride winged horses. In the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWjt6LGhHsI confrontation] between Éowyn and the Witch-king, the latter is seen riding a plump black-grey dragon-like animal. Gandalf had called it a '''Carrion-fowl'''.

'''1982-97: ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]'':'''
:The Fell Beasts are said to likely be "distant relatives of ancient [[Cold-drakes]]", and "grow to lengths of 30 feet (with 30-35-foot wingspans)". In the middle Third Age they live in [[Mountains of Mirkwood|mountainous]] areas of Mirkwood, presumably because of the [[Sauron#Sauron's Return|Necromancer]]'s presence at [[Dol Guldur]]. They are used as steeds by both the Nazgûl and a few [[Olog-hai]] warlords.<ref>{{ICE|2019}}</ref><ref group="note">In the supplement, ''[[Creatures of Middle-earth (2nd edition)|Creatures of Middle-earth]]'', the Fell beasts are said to be "presumably bred from Winged-drakes" and to have a body between 15-25 feet and a wingspan between 30-40 feet.</ref>

'''1995-8: ''[[Middle-earth Collectible Card Game]]'':'''
:'''Fell Beast''' increases the number of strikes of one Nazgûl hazard-creature. '''Wild Fell Beast''' is a Drake which attacks with three strikes. With the card "Fell Rider" the Ringwraith may move to a non-Darkhaven site, but without allies and followers.

'''2001-3: [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' (film series)]]:'''
:The fell beasts are depicted as more [[Dragons|Dragon]]-like and serpentine. As opposed to having beaks, they have lipless mouths full of jagged teeth, fins running along their spine, long whip-like tails and dark gray scales. This depiction is heavily influenced by [[John Howe]], who was one of the concept artists for the films.

:In the films, the fell beasts are used for attack much more often than in the books, with the Nazgûl usually swooping down and screeching, making the defenders at the gate of Minas Tirith run away, leaving [[Gandalf]] alone to face the Witch-king as he enters.

:Although on screen the films never make this mistake, sometimes cast or crew members ([[Lawrence Makoare]] and [[Richard Taylor]] most notably) on the commentary tracks and the documentaries refer to the fell beasts as Nazgûl; this is incorrect. The fell beasts are the creature that the nine Nazgûl ride, and the mistake probably arose because fell beasts are always seen with a Nazgûl atop them.

'''2001-: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game]]'':'''
:The Fell Beasts are portrayed without beaks, reminiscent of the depiction<!-- visual interpretation by User:Morgan --> in ''The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy''.<ref>[http://www.games-workshop.com/gws/catalog/productDetail.jsp?prodId=prod480006a&amp;_requestid=1321389 Winged Nazgûl] at [http://www.games-workshop.com/ Games-workshop.com] (accessed 10 June 2011)</ref>

'''2002: [[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'' (video game)]]:'''
:A Nazgûl mounted on a fell beast (depicted as a dragon-like creature) appears in the [[Amon Hen]] stage of the PC and console versions of the game, where it serves as the final boss. In the first phase of the battle, the beast crawls on the ground and fights Aragorn (armed with his sword). During the second and final phase, it flies into the sky and shoots green fireballs from its mouth down at Aragorn (who shoots back at it with his bow), until it is weakened and finally shot down by Legolas in the game's ending cutscene.

'''2002-5: ''[[The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying Game]]'':'''
:Hell-hawks, employed as mounts by the Ringwraiths and found wild in southern Mirkwood and (after the War of the Ring) in Gondor, resemble a "cross between lizards and featherless birds". They were bred by Sauron in mockery of the [[Eagles|Great Eagles]].<ref>{{D|Fell}}, pp. 30-31</ref>

'''2011: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'':'''
:Agandaûr has several Fell beasts under his control. At the end of Chapter 1, Agandaûr flees on the back of one of them.<ref>[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]], Chapter 1: Fornost, ''Citadel Tower''</ref>

'''2023: ''[[The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria]]'':'''
:Fell beasts are among the monsters infesting Moria. The female dragon Narag-Shazon claims that Sauron forcibly employed her to breed the creatures.
