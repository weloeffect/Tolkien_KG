These people, whose [[Melian|Queen]] was of the order of the [[Maiar]] and whose King was the High King of the Sindar, were held to be the highest and noblest of the [[Sindar|Grey-elven]] kindred.

The [[Marchwardens]] were those Elves assigned to guarding the borders of the forest of Doriath.<ref>{{S|Turin}}</ref>

After the [[Ruin of Doriath]], [[Elwing]] led the survivors to the [[Mouths of Sirion]].
