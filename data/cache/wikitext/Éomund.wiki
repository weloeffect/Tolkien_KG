'''Éomund''' was the [[Lord of Aldburg]] and a [[Marshal of the Mark]].
==History==
Éomund was a descendant of [[Eofor]], the third son of Brego the second king of Rohan, and dwelt in [[Aldburg]] in the [[Eastfold]].<ref>{{UT|Isen}}</ref> [[Aragorn]], during his travels in  Rohan, made the acquaintance of Éomund.<ref>{{TT|III2}}</ref> He married [[Théodwyn]], the sister of the later King [[Théoden]]. Their children were [[Éomer]] and [[Éowyn]], who were each to play a great part in the [[War of the Ring]]. 

He was the marshal in charge of the east marches, active in defending the horse-herds of the region against increasing raids by [[Orcs]]. He was killed in {{TA|3002}}, while pursuing such a raid, by a large force that lay in ambush in the [[Emyn Muil]]. Théodwyn grew ill and died shortly after, and their children were raised by Théoden.<ref>{{App|Eorl}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Éomund'' is made up of [[Old English]] ''[[Wiktionary:eoh|eoh]]'' ("war-horse, charger") + ''[[Wiktionary:mund#Old English|mund]]'' ("protector").<ref>{{HM|RC}}, pp. 367-8</ref> The name is appropriate to his role as the guardian of the horses of the Eastfold.
