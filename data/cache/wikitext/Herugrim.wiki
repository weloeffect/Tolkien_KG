'''Herugrim''' was the sword of [[Théoden]] King of [[Rohan]].

==History==
When Gandalf and his companions arrived at [[Meduseld]] on March 2, {{TA|3019}},<ref>{{App|Great}}, entry for the year 3019, March 2, p. 1093</ref> the sword was in the custody of Théoden's traitorous counsellor [[Gríma|Gríma Wormtongue]]. After being healed by [[Gandalf]], Théoden reclaimed the sword,<ref>{{TT|King}}, pp. 514-9</ref> and rode with it to the [[Battle of the Hornburg]] and the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields|Battle of Pelennor Fields]].

==Etymology==
''Herugrim'' is an [[Old English]] name meaning "Very fierce or cruel, savage".<ref>{{webcite|website=[http://www.bosworthtoller.com/ Bosworth-Toller Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]|articleurl=https://bosworthtoller.com/18834|articlename=heoru-grim|accessed=31 October 2023}}</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 408</ref> It has been noted that ''herugrim'' is in the [[Wikipedia:Mercian dialect|Mercian dialect]] of [[Old English]] (the spelling of the "standard" [[Wikipedia:West Saxon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon dialect]] would have been ''heorugrim'').<ref>[[Tom Shippey]], ''[[The Road to Middle-earth]]'', Chapter 4 A Cartographic Plot, The horses of the Mark, footnote after "All the Riders' names and language are Old English, as many have noted;", p. 112</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 372</ref> ''Heorugrim'' occurs in line 1564 of ''Beowulf,'' as an adjective applied to the hero in his fight with Grendel's mother; Tolkien translated it as "fell".<ref>{{Beowulf|B}} p. 58</ref>

==Other versions of the Legendarium==
In the original draft of [[Helm's Deep (chapter)|Helm's Deep]], Théoden is specifically noted as having used Herugrim in the [[Battle of the Hornburg]]. It is said "Theoden dismounted and fought among his guard. Herugrim sang a song that has long been silent."<ref>{{WR|1|II}}</ref>
