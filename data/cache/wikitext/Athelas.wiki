'''''Athelas''''', also known as '''kingsfoil''' or '''''asëa aranion''''', was a sweet-smelling herb with healing properties, such as curing wounds, poison and counteracting evil influence such as the [[Black Breath]]. It held a special power of healing in the hands of the [[Kings of Gondor]].

==History==
During the [[First Age]] ''athelas'' was perhaps growing in [[Beleriand]]. [[Huan]] had found ''athelas'' to heal [[Beren]] of his wounds.<ref name="Canto10">{{LB|C10}}</ref>

''Athelas'' most notably grew on the island of [[Númenor]] and was brought to [[Middle-earth]] by the [[Númenóreans]].<ref name="Flight">{{FR|I12}}</ref> It grew sparsely in [[Eriador|the North]] and only in places where the Men of Westernesse had camped or lived. By the end of the [[Third Age]] only the [[Rangers of the North]] retained the knowledge of its healing properties. 

In [[Gondor]] (where it was known as '''kingsfoil''') the knowledge of its healing virtues had been lost by the [[Third Age]] (on account of their dependence on the long-absent kings),<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 581</ref> and its leaves were esteemed only for their refreshing scent and their potential ability to cure headaches. However, the memory of its former uses was retained in [[When the black breath blows|verses]] remembered by some of the older women in the Houses of Healing, and the special power it held in the hands of the [[Kings of Gondor]] was once again demonstrated by [[Aragorn]] upon his return to [[Gondor]].<ref name="Healing">{{RK|V8}}</ref>

Aragorn was very familiar with the plant, and its long leaves<ref name="Flight" /> were used by him on several occasions: healing [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] from the Morgul wound,<ref name="Flight" /> tending the wounds of Frodo and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] after the exit from [[Moria]],<ref name="Lorien">{{FR|II6}}</ref> and secretly entering [[Minas Tirith]] upon his return to [[Gondor]] to heal those touched by the [[Black Breath]], an act that enhanced his reputation and strengthened his claim to the crown.<ref name="Healing" />

==Properties and Effects==
''Athelas'', when dried and crushed in hot water, was refreshing. It cleared and calmed<ref name="Flight" /> the minds of those who smelled it. ''Athelas'' also strengthened<ref name="Lorien" /> those smelling the scent. It had a particular scent that was either unique to the individual who smelled the herb or influenced by the recipient of the herb's effects:

*[[Faramir]]'s scent was of "dewy mornings of unshadowed sun... [in which] Spring is itself but a fleeting memory."<ref name="Healing" />
*[[Ioreth]] smelled the "roses of Imloth Melui" from her childhood.<ref name="Healing" />
*[[Éowyn]] smelled no scent, as if the air was clean, fresh, and had never "been breathed by any living thing and came new-made from snowy mountains high beneath a dome of stars, or from shores of silver far away washed by seas of foam."<ref name="Healing" />
*[[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]]'s scent was that of "orchards, and of heather in the sunshine full of bees."<ref name="Healing" />

==Etymology==
''Athelas'' is a [[Sindarin]] word, consisting of ''[[athae]]'' + ''[[lass]]''.<ref name="Eldarin">{{PE|Eldarin}}, pp. 49-100</ref> 

The [[Quenya]] cognate is '''''asëa aranion''''' ("asëa of the Kings").<ref name="Eldarin" /> It has been suggested that the whole name could mean "Beneficial (leaf) of Kings".<ref>[http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/quen-eng.htm Quettaparma Quenyallo] at [http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/ Ardalambion] (accessed 14 May 2011)</ref><ref>[http://www.tuckborough.net/plants.html Plants & Trees] (cf. Athelas) at [http://www.tuckborough.net/index.htm The Thain's Book] (accessed 14 May 2011)</ref> The rejected form ''asea aranaite'' was used in a manuscript version of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref>{{WR|3|XI}}, p. 394</ref>

''Kingsfoil'' has the Old French element ''foil'', "leaf" as seen in [[Wikipedia:cinquefoil|cinquefoil]].<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 781</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
''Athelas'' does not appear in the published ''[[The Silmarillion|Silmarillion]]'' or in the tales of the [[First Age]] in general; however in the early ''[[Lay of Leithian]]'' it was used by [[Huan]] and [[Lúthien]] to heal the wounded [[Beren]].<ref name="Canto10" /> This contradicts the information from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' of it being brought to Middle-earth by [[Númenóreans]],<ref name="Flight" /> so its history was either revised by [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]], or ''athelas'' grew in [[Beleriand]] before it was destroyed, and then brought ''back'' to Middle-earth by Númenóreans in the [[Second Age]].
