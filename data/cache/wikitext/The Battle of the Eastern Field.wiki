==Preface and first stanza==
<poem style="font-style:italic; margin-left:20px;">
[On Friday March 31st I came across this curious fragment in the waste paper basket, in the Prefects' room. Much of it was so blotted that I could not decipher it. I publish it with emendations of my own. G.A.B.]
I
Ho, rattles sound your warnote!
Ho, trumpets loudly bray!
The clans will strive and gory writhe
Upon the field to-day.
To-day the walls and blackboards
Are hung with flaunting script,
From Atlas on the staircase
To Bogey’s darkling crypt.
Each knight is robed in scarlet,
Or clad in olive green;
A gallant crest upon each breast
Is proudly heaving seen.
While flows our Yellow River,
While stands the great Pavil,
That Thursday in the Lenten Term
Shall be a beanfest still.<ref name=collectedpoems>{{CP|6}}</ref></poem>
