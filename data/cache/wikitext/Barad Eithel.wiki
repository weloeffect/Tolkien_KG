'''Barad Eithel''' ([[Sindarin|S.]] "Tower of the Well"<ref>{{S|Index}}</ref>) was the mountain fortress of [[Fingolfin]] and his son [[Fingon]], thus the seat of the [[High Kings of the Noldor]] (until the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad]]).  

It was set in the eastern foothills of the [[Ered Wethrin]], at [[Eithel Sirion]], the source of the River [[Sirion]].<ref>{{S|Map}}</ref> It was here that the [[Nirnaeth Arnoediad|Battle of Unnumbered Tears]] took place, and where Fingon was slain, giving [[Morgoth]] the chance to take control over the chief stronghold of both [[Mithrim]] and [[Dor-lómin]].<ref>{{S|Fifth}}</ref>
==Etymology==
The name ''Barad Eithel'' is [[Sindarin]] meaning "Tower of the Well" referring to the Wells of Sirion; from ''[[barad]]'' "tower" and ''[[eithel]]'' "well".<ref>{{S|Elements}}</ref>
