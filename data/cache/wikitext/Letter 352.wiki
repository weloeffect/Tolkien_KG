==Summary==
Ungfrú Aðalsteinsdottir, an Icelandic reader, had informed Tolkien of an upcoming translation of ''[[The Hobbit]]'' into Icelandic. Tolkien is very pleased to know this, because he considers the language best suited for the story. 
==Notes==
*Tolkien would not live to see the translation published. ''Hobbitinn'', translated by [[Úlfur Ragnarsson]] and [[Karl Ágúst Úlfsson]], was published by Almenna Bókafélagið in Reykjavik in [[1978]].
