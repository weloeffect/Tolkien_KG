'''Damrod''' was a [[Rangers of Ithilien|ranger of Ithilien]].

==History==
Damrod was the companion of [[Mablung (ranger of Ithilien)|Mablung]] and a trusted guard of [[Faramir]]. Together he and Mablung watched [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] and [[Samwise Gamgee|Sam]] during the ambush of the [[Haradrim|Men of Harad]] in [[Ithilien]]. While they waited before the battle Damrod told the hobbits of the Enemy's dealings with the [[Haradrim|Southrons]]. Damrod had little hope; he believed "the days of [[Gondor]] are numbered, and the walls of [[Minas Tirith]] are doomed".<ref name="herbs"/>

After the ambush Damrod and Mablung continued to serve as watch-guards over the hobbits as the Rangers journeyed to [[Henneth Annûn]].<ref>{{TT|Window}}</ref>

After the the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]] they are finally able to come out and join the Host of the West on the march towards the [[Black Gate]]. Upon entering the Wastes of Morannon, Damrod is chosen to lead the faint-hearted soldiers relieved by [[Aragorn]], now commanded by [[Duinhir]], towards [[Cair Andros]] through [[Ithilien]]. After King [[Aragorn|Elessar]] charges Steward Faramir with cleansing the evil of [[Minas Morgul]] and the [[Morgul Vale]], Damrod joins other Rangers in a camp outside the dead city. He later leads a group of Rangers inside [[Minas Morgul]] itself, using the confusion among enemy forces to sneak between the guard towers beneath the enemy's notice.
