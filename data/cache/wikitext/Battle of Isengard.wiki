The '''last march of the Ents''', or the '''battle of Isengard''', was a battle fought during the [[War of the Ring]].<ref>{{TT|III4}}</ref>

== The Battle ==
Spurred on by [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]] and [[Peregrin Took]], the [[Ents]], followed by [[Huorns]], invaded the [[Ring of Isengard]] from [[Fangorn Forest]]. The defenders of [[Isengard]] were Orcs and Men led (if not personally) by [[Saruman]]. The attackers surrounded Isengard, destroyed its gates, crumbled its walls and broke the dam, which flooded Isengard and the pits that Saruman used to create his war machines.

Several Ents were scorched and burned, notably [[Beechbone]]. The entire force of Orcs and Men that defended Isengard were destroyed, which may have been around one or two thousand.

== Aftermath ==
In the end, the Ents took over Isengard.  After Saruman's death and the end of the War of the Ring, the Ents made it one of the most beautiful gardens left in all of Middle-earth.

==Inspiration==
Tolkien later noted that the destruction of Isengard by the Ents was based off of personal disappointment in MacBeth, when "Birnham Wood is come to castle Dunsinane". Tolkien was less than thrilled that it amounted to men walking on stage with leaves in their hats; he decided that when he did the scene for himself, he would do it correctly.
