'''Arnor''', or the '''Northern Kingdom''', was a kingdom of the [[Dúnedain]] in the land of [[Eriador]] in [[Middle-earth]].  It was the original seat of the [[High King (Dúnedain)|High King of Arnor]] who ruled over both Arnor and [[Gondor]].

==Geography==
Arnor included most of [[Eriador]], extending from the gulf of [[Lune]] (west of which was [[Lindon]]) to the river [[Greyflood]] and its tributary, the river [[Loudwater]] (east of which was [[Rivendell]]).<ref name="eriador" />

The Dúnedain of Arnor dwelt in many places in Eriador, but most of the population centered around the region of [[Arthedain]].  The Dunedain mainly inhabited the cities of [[Fornost]] and the capital city of [[Annúminas]], as well as along the [[Baranduin]] and the gulf of [[Lune]].  By the later [[Third Age]], the settlements of the Dúnedain of [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]] had decayed and become ruins and [[barrows]].<ref name="rings" />
===Regions===

*[[Arthedain]], the core of the north-kingdom bordering the Lune
*[[Cardolan]], the lands south of the [[East Road]], east of the Brandywine
*[[Rhudaur]], the region between the Weather Hills and the [[Misty Mountains]]

===Sites of civilization===

*[[Annúminas]], the old capital on the shore of Lake Evendim
*[[Fornost]], the new capital of the successor state of Arthedain
*[[Bree]], a trading centre located on the East Road
*[[Lond Daer]], an old harbour town founded by Númenóreans
*[[Weathertop|Amon Sûl]], also called Weathertop, a watchtower on the highest of the Weather Hills
*[[Elostirion]], an elven watchtower in the [[Tower Hills]]
*[[Tharbad]], a fortified town and port on each side of the River Greyflood on the southern border of Arnor

===''[[Palantíri]]''===

The '''[[Palantíri]]''' or 'seeing stones' were spherical stones that could communicate with each other and give visual impressions to a skilled remote user.  [[Elendil]] and his two sons originally divided these stones between themselves.  They were usually heavily guarded and under the control of the kings.  There were seven of these stones in total.  The northern kingdom possessed three, and the southern kingdom held the other four.<ref name="rings" />{{rp|362}} They were:

*The [[Elostirion-stone]], kept in the tower of [[Elostirion]]. This was used to communicate with The Master Stone in [[Tol Eressëa]], the Lonely Isle of the Elves, along the [[Straight Road]].  It could not contact the other Middle-Earth stones.
*The [[Amon Sûl-stone]], kept in the watchtower of [[Weathertop|Amon Sûl]].  The [[Amon Sûl-stone]] was a large stone, and the northern kings often used it to contact its corresponding large stone in Gondor, at the great dome of [[Osgiliath]].
*The [[Annúminas-stone]], kept in Arnor's capital city of [[Annúminas]].  Though one of the lesser stones, it was the stone most often used by the [[Kings of Arnor]].

==History==
<!--"Events" in Eriador infobox links here-->
===Early history===
Before the foundation of Arnor, [[Eriador]] was home to [[Middle Men]] of [[Edain]] stock. As a result of the slow emigration that started under the [[Númenórean]]  kings [[Tar-Meneldur]] and [[Tar-Aldarion]], a sizable population formed. These early colonists soon interbred with the indigenous population of Eriador.  The [[Faithful]] favored Eriador over the more southern regions (Gondor) because the [[Elves of Lindon]] under their high king [[Gil-galad]] lived very near across the river [[Lhûn]].<ref name="rings">{{S|Rings}}</ref>{{rp|360}} Conversely, the [[King's Men]] settled more to the south in the later days. Thus, the area was populated by people who were mainly still Faithful and [[Elf-friends]], where much of the knowledge of the [[Elder Days]] was preserved.

[[File:Steven White Jr. -  Ann18.jpg|left|220px|thumb|''Palace Complex at Annúminas'' by Steven White, Jr.]]
During the [[Downfall of Númenor]], [[Elendil]] and his people sailed through the [[Gulf of Lune]] and up the [[Lune]] river, and befriended the [[High King of the Noldor]] Gil-galad.<ref name="rings" /> Both Elendil and his sons were welcomed by the Men who were in whole or part of [[Númenorean]] blood.<ref name="rings" /><ref name="languages">{{App|Men}}</ref> These [[Men of Eriador]] accepted the new kingdom of Elendil and helped to people and maintain the many places that the Northern Dúnedain built.<ref name="rings" /> The [[Men of Bree]] also became subjects of Arnor.<ref name="languages" /> Gil-galad and [[Elves of Lindon|his people]] aided the fledgling realm; he even built the [[Emyn Beraid]] for Elendil.<ref name="rings" /> 

Elendil founded Arnor at the end of the [[Second Age]] ({{SA|3320}}), while his sons founded the southern realm of [[Gondor]]. Both kingdoms of the [[Númenóreans]] were known as the [[Realms in Exile]], and their history is intertwined. 
Despite its precedence over it as the seat of the High King, Arnor was never as powerful and populous as Gondor.<ref>{{PM|Atani}}</ref>

Elendil established the city of [[Annúminas]] as his capital. Besides the chief cities like Annúminas and [[Fornost]], the [[Men of Arnor]] concentrated around the courses of the Lhûn and the [[Baranduin]], the  hills of [[Rhudaur]], and built towers on [[Amon Sûl]].<ref name="rings" /> 

===[[War of the Last Alliance]]===
[[File:The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy - Isildur 2.jpg|right|thumb|''Isildur'' in Peter Jackson's ''The Fellowship of the Ring'']]
In {{SA|3430}}, Arnor joined forces with [[Gil-galad]] in a great alliance opposing Sauron, the [[Last Alliance of Elves and Men]]. When Elendil led his people against [[Sauron]], the [[Dúnedain]] and the other Men of Eriador marched together to the South.<ref name="rings" /> In conjunction with southern forces from Gondor, they confronted Sauron's armies in the [[War of the Last Alliance]]. This great war lasted several years, reaching [[Dagorlad]] and [[Mordor]] itself far in the south, culminating in the [[Siege of Barad-dûr]].  Both [[Elendil]] and his son [[Anárion]] were slain in this conflict, but [[Isildur]] cut the [[One Ring]] from Sauron's finger and prevailed. 

Isildur (who was also King of Gondor) was the elder son of Elendil and would inherit the High Kingship and throne of Arnor. But he never reached his new realm: he was killed in {{TA|2}} in the [[Disaster of the Gladden Fields]], as were his three eldest sons; the [[One Ring]] was also lost there. 

Isildur's fourth and youngest son, [[Valandil (King of Arnor)|Valandil]], who had remained at [[Rivendell]] due to his youth, became [[Heir of Isildur|his heir]] ({{TA|10}}). But the Men of Arnor suffered heavy casualties in the War and subsequent Disaster; there now remained too few people and the places that Elendil had built became partially depopulated. Arnor never fully recovered from the devastating losses.<ref name="rings" />

Because neither Valandil nor his subsequent heirs claimed the throne of Gondor (at least until [[Arvedui|Arvedui's]] attempt), the realms were split; but whilst Arnor's ruler kept the title [[High King of the Dúnedain|High King]], in practice they were Kings of Arnor only, and had no power over the South kingdom.  [[Anárion]] and his heirs made no claim over the Northern kingdom and styled themselves as simply as [[Kings of Gondor]].

===Breakup, decline, and war with Angmar===
Arnor's capital was [[Annúminas]] on [[Lake Evendim]], but by {{TA|861}} [[Fornost Erain]] had taken its place. No longer a site of such importance, Annúminas became depopulated and was slowly abandoned.

After the death of its tenth king, [[Eärendur (King of Arnor)|Eärendur]], in {{TA|861}}, Arnor was divided up between his three sons. The eldest, [[Amlaith]], claimed Kingship over all Arnor but was reduced to only ruling the region of Arthedain as his kingdom, while the other sons founded the kingdoms of [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]].<ref name="eriador">{{App|Eriador}}</ref><ref name="rings" /><ref name="ta">{{App|TA}}</ref> The three petty kingdoms often strove with each other, usually over control of the [[Weather Hills]] and the [[palantíri|palantír]] of [[Amon Sûl]].<ref name="eriador" /> 

[[File:Grant Gould - The Witch King.jpg|right|thumb|220px|''The Witch King'' by Eliot Gould]]

Seeing the disunion in Arnor, during the reign of Malvegil (c. {{TA|1300}}), the [[Witch-king]] of [[Angmar]] arose in the north, later identified as in fact the lord of [[Sauron]]'s [[Ringwraiths]]. This new threat began attacking Rhudaur and Cardolan.<ref name="eriador" />  

Eventually the line of [[Isildur]] failed in Arthedain's sister kingdoms; the Dúnedain were always few in Rhudaur, where a lord of the [[Hill-men]], secretly supporting Angmar, seized power. Arnor was refounded ''de jure'' by the seventh [[King of Arthedain]], [[Argeleb I]], and Cardolan placed itself under its suzerainty, but Rhudaur resisted. Arthedain thus reasserted control over Cardolan and fortified a line along the [[Weather Hills]], but Rhudaur and Angmar attacked and killed the King in {{TA|1356}}. His son [[Arveleg I]], however, counterattacked in conjunction with Cardolan and [[Lindon]] and drove the enemy back.<ref name="eriador" />
[[File:BFME2 - Weathertop.jpg|left|220px|thumb|''Weathertop'' from BFME2]]
Arveleg continued to hold the frontier along the Hills for the following years, until {{TA|1409}}, when Angmar crossed the [[Hoarwell]] and successfully captured [[Weathertop]], and Arveleg fell in battle, as did the [[last prince of Cardolan]] (later interred in the [[Barrow-downs]]).<ref>{{HM|RC}}, "Fog on the Barrow-downs", pp. 144-5; Index, 'Cardolan, [[Last prince of Cardolan|last prince of]]'</ref> Amon Sûl fell, and its ''[[Amon Sûl-stone|palantír]]'' was taken to Fornost.  With Amon Sûl lost, Angmar had free rein over the all the lands of Cardolan, which was ravaged, and the population was forced to hold out in the Barrow Downs, or took refuge in the [[Old Forest]]. Rhudaur was occupied by evil Men subject to [[Angmar]], and the remaining Dúnedain were slain or fled west.<ref name="eriador" /> 

[[The Shire]], once the hunting grounds of the [[King of Arnor]], was a fertile and well-tilled part of Arnor, deserted during the waning days of Arthedain. The [[Hobbits]] (who had lived in [[Dunland]] and parts of depopulated [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]]) got official permission from King [[Argeleb II]] to settle the lands. This was finally done in {{TA|1601}} by [[Bree-hobbits]] led by the brothers [[Marcho]] and [[Blanco]]; almost all of the Hobbits of Middle-earth could be found there 30 years later. The [[Shire-hobbits]] considered themselves subjects of the King of Arthedain: at least nominally, considering the isolation of their country. Nevertheless, their histories claim they sent some support troops to the great battles Arnor fought against Angmar.<ref name="eriador" />

The Men of Arnor did not have the strength to drive away the forces of Angmar, so the [[Elves of Lindon]], forces of [[Rivendell]], and the [[Galadhrim]] would defeat the armies of Angmar much later.<ref name="eriador" />

===The [[Great Plague]]===
[[File:Amir Salehi - Servant of Death.jpg|right|220px|thumb|Amir Salehi - ''Servant of Death'']]
Another threat to the northern kingdoms appeared, the [[Great Plague]] that came from the [[East]]. The Men of Arnor were so much affected that the joint garrison at [[Tharbad]] that Arnor held with Gondor ceased to exist,<ref>{{UT|6d}}</ref> and the last of the Dúnedain of Cardolan died on the Barrow-downs. The Witch-king, exploiting the tragedy, sent evil spirits, the [[Barrow-wights]], to infest the area.

The [[Shire-folk]] were damaged by it, but not heavily. The plague lost its strength at this point however, so that most of [[Arthedain]] was unaffected.<ref name="eriador" />  

The two Realms in Exile eventually suspected that these disasters might be being coordinated by a single power, and resumed communications. As a result, Prince Arvedui, heir to the Sceptre, wedded [[Fíriel]], the daughter of [[Ondoher]] [[King of Gondor]] ({{TA|1940}}). That happened before Ondoher was slain in battle, and hoping to save his Kingdom, Arvedui staked his claim to Gondor, by right of his descent from Elendil and by that of his wife. The [[Council of Gondor]] refused the reunification and crowned King [[Eärnil II]], who maintained good relations with Arnor, promising aid against Angmar. But Arnor's strength was fast dwindling; in {{TA|1973}} Arvedui (who now was King) sent a message to Gondor that Angmar was preparing its final assault, and Eärnil mustered a great armament bound for [[Lindon]], but it would arrive too late.<ref name="gondor">{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

===Fall of Arthedain===

In {{TA|1974}}, the final chapter in Arthedain's history began. The Witch-king attacked during the harsh winter weather. The capital of [[Fornost]] fell, and the remaining Arnorian forces were driven over the Lune river into Lindon.<ref name="eriador" /> Arvedui fled to [[Forochel]], while his son, [[Aranarth]], informed [[Círdan]] at the [[Grey Havens]] about the disaster. Círdan's sailors were eventually unable to rescue Arvedui, and [[Malbeth]] the Seer's prophecy at his birth, that he would be the 'Last king' of Arthedain, was fulfilled. 

===Showdown with Angmar===
The Gondorian naval forces under [[Eärnur]], [[Captain of Gondor]] eventually landed in the Grey Havens, from which debarked the most powerful army seen in the north of Middle-earth in centuries. 

The remnants of Arnor would later join the great force, led by Cirdan and Eärnur, in the greatest joint Elf-Man army since the [[War of the Last Alliance]]; this great [[Host of the West (Arnor)|Host of the West]] marched northward toward the Arnorian capital of Fornost, where the Witch-king had occupied.
He confidently marched his forces out to meet them in the open. The Host attacked him from the [[Hills of Evendim]], and a [[Battle of Fornost|large battle]] broke out. The cavalry under Eärnur pursued what remained of the Angmar forces, and were joined by an Elven force under [[Glorfindel]] from [[Rivendell]]. Angmar fell but the Witch-King fled.

Thus both Arthedain and Angmar were destroyed. the Dúnedain of Arnor created new homes in the [[Angle of Eriador|Angle]] south of [[Rivendell]], but Aranarth perceived that his people had become too few after the continuing wars to reestablish the realm. [[Men of Bree|Some Men]] survived in [[Bree]] and other villages, while the Hobbits survived in the Shire and Bree; in the Shire they chose a [[Thain]] from among themselves to replace the fallen King in {{TA|1979}}. The Shire remained a minor but independent political unit.<ref name="lotr1018">{{App|Arnor}}</ref>

==Legacy==
===[[Rangers of the North]]===
Aranarth, instead of calling himself a king or prince, assumed the title [[Chieftains of the Dúnedain|Chieftain]] and led his dwindling people, now secretive wanderers who traveled from place to place in Eriador. His son, [[Arahael]], grew up safely in Rivendell under the fosterhood of [[Elrond]], a tradition that was followed through the rest of the Third Age. Also brought to Elrond were the heirlooms of the [[House of Isildur]]: the [[Sceptre of Annúminas]], the [[Ring of Barahir]], the shards of [[Narsil]], and the [[Star of Elendil]].<ref name="eriador" /> Thus, through them the royal [[House of Isildur]] was maintained successfully from father to son for a millennium.

There were sixteen Chieftains in direct descent, under many perils in Eriador, and many of the Chieftains died premature deaths. One of these was [[Arathorn II]], who was slain by Orcs raiding the area. So the Dúnedain survived in the shadows, waiting for a better day when the kingdom would be reborn, which would come in the time of [[Aragorn]], on [[1 May]], {{TA|3019}}. 

===[[War of the Ring]]===
The Kingdom of Arnor had been fallen for a thousand years by the time the [[War of the Ring]] broke out, but northern forces did participate in the War. [[Aragorn]] participated, the [[Heir of Isildur]], and there were several hundred of them operating during the conflict. The  A company of this group accompanied Aragorn through the [[Paths of the Dead]] and during the attack on [[Umbar]] which captured the Corsair fleet.  They participated at the last battle, fighting under his banner, at the [[Battle of the Morannon]], where [[Sauron]] was finally thrown down.

There was conflict in other areas of the North.  There were three different invasions of [[Lothlórien]], which were thrown back by the Elven army under [[Celeborn]] and [[Thranduil]].  Finally, Celeborn led an attack resulting in the [[Fall of Dol Guldur|capture of Dol Guldur]] and put an end to Sauron's northern threat.

There was also a battle fought in [[the Shire]], between Saruman's [[Ruffians]] and [[Hobbits|Hobbit]] militia forces.  This was the last battle fought in the [[War of the Ring]], and resulted in the death of Saruman and the death or capture of his followers.  This became known as the [[Battle of Bywater]], and represents the Hobbit contribution to the War.<ref name="lotr992-996">''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[The Scouring of the Shire]], pp. 992-6</ref>

===Restoration and the [[Reunited Kingdom]]===
[[File:Rowena Morrill - The Last Steward of Gondor.jpg|left|220px|thumb|''The Last Steward of Gondor'' by Rowena Morrill]]
Faramir, son of Denethor II the last Ruling Steward, presented his rod of office to the new king, and received it back from him.  [[Aragorn|Aragorn II]] then was crowned by [[Gandalf]] as [[Aragorn|King Elessar]], refounded the Kingdom of Arnor as part of the [[Reunited Kingdom]], and made [[Annúminas]] his new capital city.<ref name="lotr1019">''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Appendix A]], p. 1019.</ref> He was wed to the Elven princess Arwen, who became [[Arwen|Queen Evenstar]] of Arnor and Gondor.  After the fall of [[Sauron]] Arnor was safe again for resettlement of Men, and although it remained less populated than [[Gondor]] to the south, in time Arnor became a more densely populated region again, even if it had dwindled in size due to the independence of [[the Shire]].  The area encompassed by the Reunited Kingdom now included the territory of the [[Two Kingdoms]] at their greatest extent.  In the North, this included all the land between the [[Lune|River Lune]] and the [[Misty Mountains]], and in the South included all the land between Dunland in the west, to the [[Far Harad]] southwards, to [[Rhûn]] in the east. The reborn kingdom continued on into the Fourth Age, with [[Eldarion]] eventually succeeding his father to the throne of this now empire-sized state.

==Languages==
Many people in Arnor were of Númenórean stock. However, aside from the Exiles, most had long since mingled with non-Númenórean peoples; the predominant language spoken by them was [[Westron]].<ref>{{App|F}}</ref> At least some of the population, especially the upper classes, were fluent in [[Sindarin]], while [[Quenya]] was studied as a language of lore. Many early place names and the names of the [[House of Isildur|royal house]] were Quenya, but by the 8th century of the [[Third Age]], Quenya had given way to Sindarin.

==Etymology==
'''''Arnor''''' was the colloquial name for the '''North Kingdom'''. The North Kingdom, as the land was called at its conception, was also known as ''Turmen Follondiéva'' in [[Quenya]] and ''Arthor na Forlonnas'' in [[Sindarin]]. These names quickly fell out of use, in favour of ''Arnor'': the ''Land of the King'', so called for the kingship of [[Elendil]], and to seal its precedence over the [[Gondor|southern realm]]. In full, poetic Sindarin, it was called ''Arannor'', which mirrored its Quenya name, '''''Arandórë'''''.<ref>{{PE|17}}, p. 28</ref> Though technically ''Arandórë'' would have a Sindarin form ''Ardor'', [[J.R.R. Tolkien|Tolkien]] chose ''Arnor'' because it sounded better. This linguistic change was ascribed to a later, Mannish development of Sindarin.<ref name="L347">{{L|347}}</ref><ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 17</ref> The form '''''Arnanórë''''' is also seen.<ref name="L347" />

==Inspiration==
The subdivision of the Númenórean realms in exile into a northwestern kingdom of Arnor and a southeastern kingdom of Gondor resembles the subdivision of the Roman Empire into a Western Roman Empire and an Eastern Roman Empire (the Byzantine Empire). Emperor Charlemagne established a kind of successor empire to the Western Roman Empire, which (partially) survived as the Holy Roman Empire until A.D. 1806.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 689</ref>

The breaking up of Arnor into the three successor kingsdoms of [[Arthedain]], [[Cardolan]] and [[Rhudaur]] resembles the breaking up of the Carolingian Empire, a successor of parts of the Western Roman Empire, after the death of King Louis the Pious, the son of Charlemagne, into three kingdoms that were ruled by three of his sons.<ref>{{HM|RC}}, p. 690</ref>

In a letter to Charlotte and Denis Plimmer, the authors of a draft of an article who had interviewed him, [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] stated that the tale "ends in what is far more like the re-establishment of an effective Holy Roman Empire with its seat in Rome".<ref>{{L|294}}</ref>

==Portrayal in adaptations==
'''2002: {{tttee}}:
:Peter Jackson's movies do not mention the long history of how Arnor and Gondor diverged, nor do they mention Arnor by name. The one passing reference to it is in a scene from the Extended Edition, when Aragorn reveals to Éowyn that he is actually eighty-seven years old. She realises that he must be one of the [[Dúnedain]], a descendant of Númenor blessed with long life, but says that she thought his race had passed into legend. Aragorn acknowledges that he is one of the Dúnedain, and explains that there are not many of his people left, because "the Northern kingdom was destroyed long ago".

'''2012: [[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]:'''
:The kingdom of Arnor is mentioned indirectly by [[Galadriel]] in the [[White Council]] scene, and so is the [[Angmar War|war with Angmar]] and its aftermath.
