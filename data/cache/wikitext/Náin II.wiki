'''Náin II''' ([[Third Age]] {{TA|2338|n}} - {{TA|2585|n}}, died age 247) was the King of [[Durin's Folk]] for 97 years, succeeding his father [[Óin (King of Durin's Folk)|Óin]] upon his death in {{TA|2488}}, being the heir of [[Durin|Durin the Deathless]].<ref name="AppA">{{App|A3}}</ref> 

==History==
Náin became King of the [[Dwarves]] of Durin shortly after the end of the [[Watchful Peace]], when [[Sauron]] returned to [[Mirkwood]] from out of the East.  The majority of Durin's Folk at this time dwelt in the [[Grey Mountains]], which had been their home since [[Thorin I]] had moved there from [[Lonely Mountain|Erebor]] in order to mine their riches. During his time, [[Orcs]] increased in the [[Misty Mountains]], and the [[Éothéod]] removed from their northern lands adjacent to the Grey Mountains to settle in [[Calenardhon]]. Towards the end of Náin's reign, [[dragons]] from the [[Forodwaith (lands)|wastes to the north]] began to come south and make [[War of the Dwarves and Dragons|war on the Dwarves]].

Nain was the ancestor of seven of the thirteen Dwarves of [[Thorin and Company]] ([[Thorin]], [[Fíli]], [[Kíli]], [[Balin]], [[Dwalin]], [[Óin]], and [[Glóin]]) and [[Gimli]] [[Elf-friend]] of the [[Company of the Ring]].

==Etymology==
''Náinn'' is a dwarf from the ''[[Völuspá|Dvergatal]]''. It means "Corpselike".<ref>Chester Nathan Gould, "Dwarf-Names: A Study in Old Icelandic Religion", published in ''Publications of the Modern Language Association of America'', Vol 44 (1929), issue #4, pp. 939-967</ref>
