'''Amárië''' ([[Quenya|Q]], pron. {{IPA|[aˈmari.e]}}) was a [[Vanyar]]in [[Elves|Elf]] who was loved by [[Finrod]].

Finrod, son of [[Finarfin]], was a [[Noldor]]in prince who met Amárië in [[Valinor]]. Although in love with one another, they did not marry, and Amárië did not follow Finrod into exile to [[Beleriand]].<ref name="S-Noldor">{{S|Noldor}}</ref> According to ''[[The Grey Annals]]'', this was because she was not permitted.<ref name="GA-1">{{GA|109}}</ref> Following Finrod's death at the hands of [[Sauron]] during the [[Quest for the Silmaril]], he was brought back to life and lives with Amárië in Valinor.<ref name="GA-2">{{GA|180}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name is not given an interpretation within the legendarium. [[Helge Fauskanger]] suggests that this [[Quenya]] name is perhaps derived from ''mára'' "good".<ref>{{webcite|author=[[Helge Fauskanger]]|articleurl=http://folk.uib.no/hnohf/quen-eng.htm|articlename=English-Quenya Wordlist (Quettaparma Quenyanna)|dated=|website=Arda}}</ref> 

Another possibility is that the name includes the element ''[[mar]]'', "home"<ref name="EOA">{{webcite|articleurl=http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/a/amarie.html|articlename=Amarië|website=EoA}}</ref> [[Ruth S. Noel]] makes a similar interpretation and defines ''Amárië'' as "Of the Home".<ref name="LOTME">[[Ruth S. Noel]], ''[[The Languages of Tolkien's Middle-earth]]'' (revised edition), p. 108</ref>

==Other versions of the legendarium==
According to a version of the [[legendarium]] following the completion of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', [[Felagund]] had a wife named '''[[Meril]]''' who went with him into exile and bore the [[Elven life cycle#Early_life|child]] [[Gil-galad]]. She was sent away by Felagund along with their son to her [[Falathrim|own folk]] at [[Eglorest]] in the [[Havens of the Falas]] during the [[Dagor Bragollach]], due to Felagund fearing "that all strong places were doomed to fall at last before the might of [[Morgoth]]".<ref name="WJ">{{WJ|Ruin}}, p. 242</ref> This was later changed so that Finrod had no child - with Gil-galad becoming the son of [[Orodreth]], Finrod's nephew - and Amárië remaining in Aman.<ref name="PM">{{PM|Shibboleth}}, p. 349</ref>
