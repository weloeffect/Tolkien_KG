'''''Dungeons & Dragons''''' is a popular fantasy role-playing game that was first published by [[TSR]] in [[1974]]. While unrelated to [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s works, it took inspiration from it. Since [[1997]] it is owned and published by [[Wizards of the Coast]], who also publish the card game ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]''.

Branching off from war games as the first published tabletop role-playing game, it paved the way for later games such as ''[[Middle-earth Role Playing]]''. Until [[2013]], [[Dragon Magazine]] served as one of its official periodicals.

==Inspiration from Tolkien==
''Dungeons & Dragons'', especially in its early days, borrowed liberally from various sources.<ref>[[Wikipedia:Robert J. Kuntz|Rob Kuntz]]; "[[Tolkien in D&D|Tolkien in Dungeons & Dragons]]" in ''[[Dragon Magazine|Dragon]]'' #13</ref><ref name="Dragon95">[[Wikipedia:Gary Gygax|Gary Gygax]]; "[[The influence of J.R.R. Tolkien on the D&D and AD&D games|On the Influence of J.R.R. Tolkien on the D&D and AD&D games]]" in ''Dragon'' #95</ref> Its use of terms from Tolkien's works specifically came under scrutiny in [[1977]] when TSR was threatened with a lawsuit by Elan Merchandising or [[Tolkien Enterprises]]. Their primary objection concerned TSR's board game ''[[Battle of the Five Armies (board game)|The Battle of the Five Armies]]'', though they also targeted terminology within ''Dungeons & Dragons'', leading to some name changes in subsequent releases after the suit was settled:

* ''[[Hobbits|Hobbit]]'' to "[[halflings|halfling]]"
* ''[[Ents|Ent]]'' to "treant"
* ''[[Balrogs|Balrog]]'' to "Type VI demon [balor]"<ref>{{Cite web|articleurl=https://www.enworld.org/threads/q-a-with-gary-gygax.22566/page-149|articlename=Q&A with Gary Gygax|author=Gygax|website=[https://www.enworld.org En World]|dated=2003}}</ref><ref>[[Michael D.C. Drout|Drout]]; "[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia: Scholarship and Critical Assessment|J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia]]", p. 229</ref>

Other names, like [[Elves]], [[Half-elven|Half-elves]], [[Dwarves]] and [[Dragons]], are so common, and not necessarily related to Tolkien's works, that they still stand.

==Adaptations==
''[[Adventures in Middle-earth]]'' and its successor ''[[The Lord of the Rings Roleplaying]]'' are licensed role-playing games for 5th edition ''Dungeons & Dragons''.

Fans also adapted older editions to the setting as the ''Eä d20 RPG''.<ref>{{Cite web|articleurl=https://www2.earpg.com/documents/ea-d20-rpg|articlename=Eä d20 RPG|website=[https://www2.earpg.com Eä RPG]}}</ref>
