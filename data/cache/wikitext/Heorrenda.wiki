'''Heorrenda''' was a son of a [[Men|Man]] [[Eriol]] and an [[Elf]] [[Naimi]],<ref group="note">In one of the texts associated with ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]'', Heorrenda's mother is named [[Nelmir]], and he also has a brother called [[Hendwine]].</ref><ref name=Hen>{{PE|15}}, "[[Names and Required Alterations]]", Appendix, ''Text X'', p. 17</ref> according to the early version of the [[legendarium]] in ''[[The Book of Lost Tales]]''.<ref name="Ers">{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''10''', p. 290</ref>

== History ==
Heorrenda was born in Tol Eressëa,<ref name="Ers"/> and, according to one text, it was he who completed the ''[[Golden Book]]'', in which were written the histories of the [[Elves]], that was kept in Tol Eressëa.<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''11''', p. 290</ref>

After the [[Faring Forth]],<ref group="note">According to another text, Heorrenda accompanied his father Eriol in his return from Tol Eressëa to the [[Great Lands]]. In that text, it was Eriol himself who hastened the Faring Forth, and thus ultimately doomed it.</ref><ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''14''', p. 294</ref> the disastrous attempt by the [[Elves]] of Tol Eressëa to save their [[Ilkorindi|kin]] in the Great Lands which resulted in their total defeat and eventual fading, evil Men invaded Tol Eressëa, now anchored near the coast of the Great Lands.<ref name="Hay"/>

Afterwards however, Heorrenda, alongside his half-brothers [[Hengest]] and [[Horsa]], led what would become the [[wikipedia:English people|English]] people and conquered Tol Eressëa, after which it became known as [[wikipedia:England|England]].<ref name="Hay">{{LT2|VI}}, p. 293</ref> There, he would settle in what was once the village of [[Tavrobel]], now called ''Gréata Hægwudu'', and which would eventually become known as the village of [[wikipedia:Great Haywood|Great Haywood]].<ref>{{LT2|VI}}, outline '''13''', pp. 291-2</ref>

He, his half-brothers, and the English people as a whole, would ultimately be the only group of [[Men]] to remain friendly to the Elves, and to keep the "true tradition of the [[Elves|fairies]]".<ref name="Hay"/>

== Etymology ==
The name ''Heorrenda'' is in [[Old English]] and of uncertain meaning.

It is found in old Germanic poetry (such as the Old English poem ''[[Déor (poem)|Déor]]'') and the first element has been interpreted as ''heorra'' meaning "a hinge, cardinal point"; an etymological connection with the Latin ''corvus'' and Greek ''korax'' (both meaning "raven") has been proposed, possibly in the sense of a pick used to play a stringed instrument, with ''Heorrenda'' meaning "minstrel".<ref name=Hen/>

== Other names ==
Heorrenda was also known as '''''Heruven''''' in [[Qenya]], with '''''Herwent''''' being its [[Gnomish]] equivalent. These two names were most likely phonological imitations of the name ''Heorrenda'' instead of being translations of its meaning.

The first element of ''Heruven'' is probably ''[[heru]]'' ("lord"), while the second element of ''Herwent'' is most likely ''[[gwent]]/gwenn/gwen'' ("large, big; fine") - hence ''Heruven'' and ''Herwent'' might mean "great lord".<ref name=Hen/>

<nowiki>*</nowiki> The name of Hendwine's mother is not Naimi but ''[[Nelmir]]'' in the text on which the basis of his inclusion is founded upon - neither is her relation to Lindo and Vairë elaborated on.<ref name=Hen/>

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In some of the later notes, '''Heorrenda''', called "the harper", is described as being the son of [[Ælfwine]] and [[Earissë]], the daughter of [[Lindo]]. Here he has a brother called [[Hlúdwine]].<ref>{{PE|15}}, "[[Names and Required Alterations]]", Appendix, ''Text XI'', p. 18</ref>

=== Later etymology ===
In these texts, the Qenya name for ''Heorrenda'' is '''''Heruvendo''''' ('''''Horwin''''' being its Gnomish equivalent). 

As with the earlier names ([[Heorrenda#Etymology|see above]]) ''Heruvendo'' likewise seems to be a phonological imitation of ''Heorrenda'', corresponding even more closely than ''Heruven''.<ref name=Lus>{{PE|15}}, "[[Names and Required Alterations]]", Appendix, ''Text XII'', p. 18</ref>

However, the first element ''Hor-'' in ''Horwin'' cannot be cognate with ''Heru-'' in ''Heruvendo''. It is possible that ''Horwin'' might have been a slip for '''''Herwin''''', though in the old German poem ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kudrun Kudrun]'', the form ''Horund'' (or ''Horant'') appears for the name ''Heorrenda'', which might have inspired the Gnomish name of ''Horwin''.<ref name=Lus/>

== Inspiration ==
The name ''Heorrenda'' appears in the Old English poem ''Déor'', where Heorrenda was a bard that has supplanted Déor, another bard and the main character of the poem, in their lord's favour.

In some of [[Tolkien]]'s lectures on the poem ''[[Beowulf (poem)|Beowulf]]'', he named the unknown author of the poem as ''Heorrenda''.<ref>{{LT2|VIb}}, p. 323</ref>
