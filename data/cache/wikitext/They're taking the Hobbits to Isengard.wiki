'''They're taking the Hobbits to Isengard''' is a 2005 music video made by Erwin Beekveld ([[1969]] - [[31 March]] [[2022]]).<ref>[https://www.discogs.com/es/artist/3862287-Erwin-Beekveld Erwin Beekveld] on discogs.com (accessed 27 June 2023)</ref> It is a mix of footage from ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]''. The song is formed around the phrase, uttered by [[Legolas]], "They're taking the Hobbits to Isengard". This line is spoken in ''The Two Towers'', when Legolas spots the [[Uruk-hai]] and extrapolates their objective from the direction in which they run. It should be noted that Legolas states the Uruks turned north-east - a direction which would not lead them to Isengard, but straight back at the pursuers. The actual direction should be north-west.

The lyrics are scrambled lines from Legolas, [[Gollum]] and [[Celeborn]]. Footage of [[Frodo Baggins]], [[Peregrin Took]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]], [[Aragorn]], [[Gimli]], [[Galadriel]] and [[Samwise Gamgee]] is also shown. The music is a computerized mix of two themes of [[Howard Shore]]'s music; "[[The Shire (soundtrack)|The Shire]]" theme and "[[The Ring Goes South (soundtrack)|The Ring Goes South]]" theme.
