== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In one of the manuscripts of ''[[The Notion Club Papers]]'', during the recital of the ''[[Lay of King Sheave]]'' in [[Edward the Elder]]'s court, it wasn't Ælfwine or Tréowine who recited the poem, but rather one Céolwulf (who wasn't the father of Tréowine at that point).<ref>{{SD|2dn}}, Note 103, p. 273</ref>
