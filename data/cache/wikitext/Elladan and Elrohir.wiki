<center>{{Quote|‘And have you marked the brethren Elladan and Elrohir? Less sombre is their gear than the others’, and they are fair and gallant as Elven-lords; and that is not to be wondered at in the sons of Elrond of Rivendell.’|''[[The Return of the King]]'', "[[The Passing of the Grey Company]]"}}</center>

'''Elladan''' and '''Elrohir''' were the [[Twins|twin]] sons, and eldest children, of [[Elrond]] and [[Celebrían]].

They were descended from the royal Houses of the [[Eldar]] through both their father and mother, but also from the noble Houses of the [[Edain]] through their father.

==Description==
The brothers were tall, dark-haired and grey-eyed, and so much alike that only those that knew them well could tell them apart. To [[Meriadoc Brandybuck]], their fair elven faces seemed neither old nor young. While in the [[Grey Company]], they wore cloaks of silver-grey over bright mail.<ref name="Passing" />

==History==
In the year {{TA|2509}} the twins' mother Celebrían went on a journey into the south to visit her own mother, [[Galadriel]], in the land of [[Lothlórien|Lórien]].<ref name="Arahad">{{App|Eriador}}, entry for Chieftain Arahad I, p. 1043</ref> In the [[Redhorn Pass]], she was captured by [[Orcs of the Misty Mountains]], and tortured<ref name="Arahad" /> in their dens<ref name="Meetings">{{FR|Meetings}}, p. 227</ref>. The twins rode to rescue her, but by the time they reached her, she had received a poisonous wound. Though their father healed her, she would not remain in [[Middle-earth]], and sailed into the [[Aman|West]] the following year.<ref name="Arahad" /> After this loss, Elladan and Elrohir never forgot their mother's torture in the dens of the Orcs and often rode far from Rivendell with the [[Rangers of the North]].<ref name="Meetings" />

In {{TA|2933|n}},<ref>{{App|TA}}, entry for the year 2933, p. 1089</ref> they saw [[Arathorn II]] killed by orcs while hunting with him.<ref>{{App|Tale}}, p. 1057</ref>

===War of the Ring===
{{expansion}}
In the early part of the [[War of the Ring]], the brothers' main role was to scout the land and prepare the way for the [[Fellowship of the Ring|Fellowship]]. Around [[November]] of {{TA|3018}}, they were sent by Elrond on a secret errand. They passed down the [[Silverlode]] into a "[[Lothlórien|strange country]]" and were the last to return to [[Rivendell]] in [[December]].<ref>{{FR|South}}, p. 274</ref>

Later, they took a more active part. When [[Halbarad]] rode to [[Aragorn]]'s aid with the [[Grey Company]], Elladan and Elrohir accompanied them and Elrohir gave counsel from [[Elrond|his father]] to Aragorn to "remember the [[Paths of the Dead]]".<ref>{{RK|Company}}, p. 775</ref> They followed Aragorn through the [[Paths of the Dead]], fought with him at [[Pelargir]], and took part in the [[Battle of the Pelennor Fields]], where they fought with stars bound to their brows. Both were present at a council of Aragorn and his captains, and then accompanied the force that fought in the [[Battle of the Morannon]].

After the celebrations and the coronation of Aragorn, the brothers departed [[Minas Tirith]] on [[8 May]]. On [[14 June]] they met with the escort of their [[Arwen|sister]] on her way to [[Gondor]] to marry Aragorn, and together they went to [[Edoras]]. They stayed there for [[16 June|two days]] before setting out for Gondor. They arrived to the City on [[1 Lithe]]<ref>{{app|Chief}}</ref> and the brothers held a silver banner.<ref>{{RK|Steward}}</ref>

===Later fate===
After the War, little is known of the brothers' fate. They returned to their father's house at Rivendell and remained there even after their father had passed across the [[Belegaer|Sea]].<ref name="Rec">{{FR|Records}}</ref> Like their sister [[Arwen]], the sons of Elrond [[Half-elven]] were granted the choice of whether to leave [[Middle-earth]] for the [[Undying Lands]], or remain there and become [[Gift of Men|mortal]] as [[Men]]. They chose, for a time at least, to stay in Middle-earth for reasons unknown.<ref>{{L|153}}</ref> However, due to the fact that shortly before Aragorn died in {{FoA|120}}, he said to Arwen that 'none now walk' in the garden of Elrond, indicating that the last of the [[Eldar]] had departed to [[Valinor]],<ref>{{App|Tale}}</ref> and that [[Celeborn]] dwelt in Rivendell for a while before he eventually departed over the Sea,<ref name="Rec" /> it seems likely that both twins had left Rivendell before or at the time of their grandfather's last trip for the Undying Lands.

==Etymology==
===Elladan===
''Elladan'' is [[Sindarin]] for "Elf-man", from ''[[el]]'' ("elf") + ''[[adan]]'' ("man"). It could also be translated as "Elf-Númenórean", as ''adan'' refers to the [[Edain]], who later became [[Númenóreans]].<ref name="twins">{{L|211}}, pp. 281-2</ref>

===Elrohir===
''Elrohir'' is Sindarin for "Elf-man" or "Elf-knight", from ''el'' ("elf") + ''[[rohir]]'' ("horse-lord").<ref name="twins" />
