'''Walking with Bilbo''' is a devotional book by Sarah Arthur.

==From the publisher==
{{blockquote|The author of Walking with Frodo takes readers on an adventure of faith with a new devotional that relates themes from [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[The Hobbit]] to living the [[Christianity|Christian life]]. Unlike the fateful quest [[Frodo Baggins|Frodo]] was asked to carry out, [[Bilbo Baggins]]'s journey came as an unexpected adventure. Readers will be reminded that God chooses us to be unlikely heroes in the adventure of life.}}
