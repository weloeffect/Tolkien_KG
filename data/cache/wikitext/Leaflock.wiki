'''Leaflock''', called '''Finglas''' in [[Sindarin]], was one of the [[Ents]] of [[Fangorn Forest]]. 

== History ==
Finglas, [[Skinbark|Fladrif]], and [[Treebeard|Fangorn]] were the oldest of the [[Ents]] of Fangorn Forest still alive in the later [[Third Age]].

According to [[Treebeard]], Leaflock had become tired, sometimes sleeping through entire seasons (although formerly he used to rouse up in winter), and tree-like with a covering of leafy hair.<ref name=iii4>{{TT|III4}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The name ''Finglas'' is apparently composed by the two elements ''[[fing]]/[[find]]'' "lock of hair" and ''[[las]]'' "leaf".<ref>{{HM|Guide}}, entry "Finglas"</ref>

The element ''lock'' in ''Leaflock'' here has the meaning of "hair" since it is a translation of his [[Sindarin]] name.<ref name="Nomen">{{HM|N}}, p. 760</ref>

The name obviously refers to his being "Covered with leafy hair".<ref name=iii4/>
