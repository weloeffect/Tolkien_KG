The '''Host of the West''' was a combined allied force of [[Elves]], [[Men]], and possibly [[Hobbits]] during the [[Angmar conflict]].
 
==Formation==
The host composed of a vast army from [[Gondor]] (actually just a small force compared to the full might of [[Gondor]])<ref name=gondor/> that arrived in a massive fleet, which hardly could find harborage, for its might filled [[Forlond]], [[Harlond (Lindon)|Harlond]], and the [[Grey Havens]].<ref name=gondor/>

The [[Northmen]], proud princes of [[Rhovanion]]; riders tall and fair came with beautiful [[horses]] from the [[Vales of Anduin]] that gathered most praise when they arrived at [[Mithlond]].<ref name=gondor/>

[[Círdan]], Master of the [[Grey Havens]], summoned all who would fight from the [[Elves of Lindon]], as well as the remnants of the [[Men of Arnor]].<ref name=gondor/> Among the forces of former [[Arthedain]] it is said that there were some [[Hobbits]] from [[the Shire]].<ref name=gondor/>

==History==
In {{TA|1973}}, [[Arthedain]] was in danger and King [[Eärnil II]] sent his son Prince [[Eärnur]] and a massive fleet to their aid. After [[Arnor]] [[fall of Fornost|fell]] to [[Angmar]], Prince [[Eärnur]], in his capacity as [[Captain of Gondor]], reached belatedly [[Lindon]] with his fleet to the aid of Arthedain.

Although it was too late, the fleet and the host it brought, seemed so massive, that there was much joy and wonder among [[Elves]] and [[Men]].<ref name=gondor/> The allied host, led by [[Círdan]] and [[Eärnur]], marched east across the river [[Lune]] to [[Fornost]] to challenge the [[Witch-king]], while the main body of the Host's horsemen, was to pass around the hills to surprise [[Fornost]] from the north. The [[Witch-king]] was crushed at the [[Battle of Fornost]] ({{TA|1975}}).

After the main part of the battle, the Host was joined by a force of [[Elves]] from [[Rivendell]] led by [[Glorfindel]], who chased the [[Witch-king]].<ref name=gondor/>
