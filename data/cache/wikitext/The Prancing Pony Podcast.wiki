{{blockquote|We cover a few pages of each chapter in each episode: reading our favorite passages, discussing themes, savoring Tolkien's language, and highlighting connections across the vast landscape of the mythology of Middle-earth. But it's less an academic lecture and more a nerdy hangout! We combine our in-depth study with a healthy dose of self-effacing humor, pop culture references, and bad puns. It's our goal to make even Tolkien's deepest works accessible to anyone; and we do this by being the sort of guys you'd want to hang out at a pub and talk Tolkien with.<ref name="about" />|The Prancing Pony Podcast}}
