'''Anardil''' ({{TA|136}}<ref name="Elendil">{{PM|Elendil}}</ref> – {{TA|411|n}},<ref>{{App|South}}</ref> aged 275 years) was the sixth [[King of Gondor]], ruling for 87 years, from {{TA|324|n}} until his death. He was succeeded by his son, [[Ostoher]].

==History==
Anardil's reign over [[Gondor]] was uneventful. He is remembered as the last of [[Gondor|Gondor's]] kings to dwell exclusively in the capital of [[Osgiliath]]. Anardil's son, Ostoher, was to set the precedent of the kings spending the summer at [[Minas Anor]], the citadel later known as [[Minas Tirith]].<ref>{{App|Gondor}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Anardil'' is [[Quenya]]. Its meaning is not glossed, but as Paul Strack explains, it seems to mean "Lover of the Sun" and to be a compound of [[Anar]] ("sun") and [[-ndil|-(n)dil]] ("friend, lover").<ref>{{webcite|author=Paul Strack|articleurl=https://www.eldamo.org/content/words/word-411053215.html|articlename=Q.

== Other versions of the legendarium ==
In ''[[The Peoples of Middle-earth]]'', Section VII "[[The Heirs of Elendil]]", it was explained that three manuscripts existed in the textual history of this section.  Manuscript A contained the Southern Line of Gondor, and appeared to be the first stage of composition.  Manuscript B added the Northern Line, and began as a fair copy of A for the Southern line but became heavily emended.  Manuscript B led to Manuscript C, a fine copy (but with later emendations), which led to a final typescript D.  In the earlier Manuscripts A and B, Anardil lived from {{TA}} 132 to 407 instead of {{TA|136}} to {{TA|411|n}}.<ref name="Elendil"/>
