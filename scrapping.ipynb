He grew up under the guardianship of the [[Master of Buckland]] [[Rorimac Brandybuck|Rorimac \"Goldfather\" Brandybuck]], who was his maternal uncle. Frodo was caught several times stealing [[mushrooms]] from [[Farmer Maggot]], who, on the last incident, thrashed Frodo and set his three dogs to chase Frodo from [[Bamfurlong]] to [[Bucklebury Ferry]].

He enjoyed life with Bilbo, with whom he shared the same birthday - though others often called the old hobbit \"queer.\" Bilbo taught him to read, and told him stories of the past, even giving him some instruction in the [[elvish]] tongue. Frodo was the only one Bilbo allowed to read [[There and Back Again|his memoirs]].

At this party Bilbo gave his farewell speech, and made his long-planned \"disappearance\" and withdrawal from [[the Shire]]. Frodo, who had been informed beforehand of the \"joke\", as Bilbo called it, was spared the shock that afflicted the other assembled Hobbits. Frodo returned home as the new Master of Bag End, as per [[Bilbo's will]].

Then [[Gandalf]] the [[Wizards|wizard]], who had come for the festivities, warned Frodo not to use the magic ring, and to keep it secret and safe. Then he left, Frodo knew not where, with his mind full of curiosity about the ring. A suspicion was growing in the back of the Wizard's mind, but Gandalf did not yet know what it was.\n",

He had also inherited some strange customs from Bilbo, like wandering by himself at nights far from home in the hills and woods under the starlight. His closest friends at this time were [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Merry]] and [[Peregrin Took|Pippin]], also [[Folco Boffin]] and [[Fredegar Bolger]], and other cousins from the family of the [[Old Took]]. Like Bilbo, Frodo continued to look robust and energetic even in his forties, and dreamed of one day seeing mountains and wilderness; he often wondered what lay beyond the borders of the Shire, and as he grew older, he would travel further and further from home. His friends were worried, and suspected that he met [[Elves]] and other strangers that had begun to be more common sights in the Shire.

Furthermore, the Dark Lord was now aware of its survival, and would be searching for it, as [[Gollum]] had revealed - under torture - that it was to be found in the Shire. After a long discussion and a test by fire, which revealed the [[Black Speech]] written upon the ring, the two agreed that Frodo would have to leave the Shire for his own safety. [[Samwise Gamgee]], the gardener, was selected to travel with him. Gandalf recommended Rivendell as a destination, as the road was likely safe and the valley well-protected. He told Frodo to take the alias [[Mr. Underhill|Underhill]] while abroad. Frodo was reluctant, but wisely followed the wizard's advice. He bought a house in [[Crickhollow]] as an excuse to head east.\n",

            "Gandalf stayed for two months while Frodo worked out the details. At the end of that time the wizard left to \"get some news\", as rather disturbing tidings had come to his ears. He promised to be back for the farewell party. Meanwhile, Frodo was not aware that some of his closest friends were watching him - [[Fredegar Bolger|Fredegar \"Fatty\" Bolger]], his cousin [[Peregrin Took|Peregrin \"Pippin\" Took]], [[Meriadoc Brandybuck|Meriadoc \"Merry\" Brandybuck]], and Sam himself knew that Frodo and Gandalf were in some trouble concerning the Ring, and that Frodo was preparing for some adventure.\n",

            "As autumn passed, Frodo was waiting for Gandalf, but did not return and Frodo grew quite anxious. Merry and Fatty drove the cart of Frodo's belongings ahead, while Frodo still waited for Gandalf. At the last possible day, he gave up waiting and departed with Pippin and Sam.\n",

The rider was dressed in black, riding upon a black horse, and making queer sniffling noises. Frodo felt the urge to put on the Ring and vanish, but just as he was about to give in, the rider departed at a trot. Samwise then remarked upon the \"[[Nazgûl|Black Rider]]\" that had spoken to his father, [[Gaffer Gamgee]], some time earlier. This made Frodo wish that he had waited for Gandalf.\n",

            "That night, they were again overtaken by a Black Horseman. This time it seemed to be able to sniff out their hiding place. But as it approached, it was driven away by the song of a group of [[Elves]]. Their leader, [[Gildor]], greeted the hobbits warmly, and lauded Frodo for his knowledge of their tongue. Frodo tried to get information from Gildor on the Black Riders, but the elf would tell him very little. Gildor foresaw that Frodo would have many dealings with the Riders in the future, and urged him to flee them whenever he met them. He and his party left the Hobbits before daybreak, while the three slept.\n",

That evening they heard a terrible wail, and Frodo distinguished words in it. Before long they came to [[Bamfurlong]], the property of [[Farmer Maggot]]. Although Pippin knew Maggot, Frodo recalled a scare he had received at a young age after caught stealing the farmer’s mushrooms, being threatened with the dogs. He froze when the dogs came forth from the house, but Maggot's hospitality soon won him over. When Maggot told of a Black Rider who had stopped at his house asking for \"Baggins,\" and made several shrewd guesses, Frodo grew uncomfortable. Maggot took them to [[Bucklebury Ferry]] in his wagon. There they joined up with Merry. As they were ferried across into [[Buckland]], they caught sight of a dark shape on the landing from which they had come.\n",

Rescued by [[Tom Bombadil]], the hobbits came to his house. There they met Tom's wife, [[Goldberry]], and Frodo was moved to poetry over her loveliness.

He rose and in a tremendous act of bravery and resilience took a sword and smote off the wight's hand. Then he summoned Bombadil with a [[Ho! Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo!|song]] Tom had taught him. Bombadil drove the wight away and helped Frodo wake the others. Tom gave the hobbits ponies and escorted them all to the road before turning his face back toward the Withywindle.

Frodo asked if Gandalf was present in Bree, only to learn that he had not yet arrived. While Pippin and Sam enjoyed the drink and conversation, Frodo remained withdrawn, soon falling into conversation with a curious [[Rangers of the North|ranger]] called [[Aragorn|Strider]], who gave him a warning about letting his friends talk to much. Pippin began to tell about [[Bilbo's Farewell Party|Bilbo's Birthday Party]], and Frodo, at Strider’s encouragement and in an attempt to prevent the name of Baggins from being raised, began to sing ''[[The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late]]''.

The suspicious Breelanders, however, grew angry or frightened, and eventually all left the common-room. Frodo and his comrades retired to their room, where they found Strider waiting to talk to them. Strider was honest and blunt, telling what he had overheard and what he knew of them, as well as warning them of the Black Riders and traitors in Bree. He urged them to accept his aide by inviting him into the company. Frodo was leaning to believe the ranger when Butterbur broke in, giving Frodo the long-awaited letter from Gandalf, undelivered by Butterbur’s forgetfulness. After some little bit of light was shed on the situation to the innkeeper, he swore to help the hobbits in any way he could, as a friend of Gandalf and one very much afraid of Mordor. Frodo, reading the letter, learned that Gandalf recommended Strider as one to whom Frodo could go for help. After some further debate, Frodo agreed to let Strider lead them to Rivendell.\n",

They passed through [[Chetwood]] and [[Midgewater Marshes]], and finally to the [[Weather Hills]] before coming up to [[Weathertop]]. Black Riders were sighted from the top of the cairn, and Strider counselled to remain where they were. Shortly after the Black Riders came, and Frodo was stricken down. In desperation he put on the Ring and saw the [[Nazgûl]] in their true forms.

Glorfindel, seeing that Frodo was starting to fade, put him upon his horse, [[Asfaloth]], and ordered him to go on when the Ringwraiths approached. Asfaloth outran the steeds of the Nazgûl and bore Frodo across the [[Ford of Bruinen]], but Frodo, who was on the brink of becoming a [[Wraiths|wraith]], turned around at the other side and defied the Nine. The Riders, were driven into the [[Bruinen|River]] by Glorfindel, Strider and the three hobbits, where they were swept away by the ensuing waters.<ref>{{FR|Flight}}</ref> As a sign that Frodo was shifting to the [[Wraith-world]], he could see the [[Unseen]] [[Light of Valinor|luminous form]] of Glorfindel.\n",
